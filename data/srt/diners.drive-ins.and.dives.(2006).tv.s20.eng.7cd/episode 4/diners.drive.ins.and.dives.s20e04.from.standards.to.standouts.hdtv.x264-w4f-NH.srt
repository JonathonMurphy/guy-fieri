1
00:00:01,068 --> 00:00:02,134
Hey, there.

2
00:00:02,136 --> 00:00:03,602
I'm Guy Fieri,
  and we're rolling out

3
00:00:03,604 --> 00:00:07,072
looking for America's greatest
 diners, drive-ins, and dives.

4
00:00:07,074 --> 00:00:08,774
This trip...
Look at this.

5
00:00:08,776 --> 00:00:10,709
...we're seeking out
  the standards...

6
00:00:10,711 --> 00:00:13,212
Yes!
 ...that totally stand out.

7
00:00:13,214 --> 00:00:15,014
Knock your mama
  out the rocking chair.

8
00:00:15,016 --> 00:00:17,249
We don't typically use
that line on "Triple D."

9
00:00:17,251 --> 00:00:20,753
In Jackson, Wyoming,
  rock-star Mexican...

10
00:00:20,755 --> 00:00:22,621
There were sopes
   at the bottom of this.

11
00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:25,124
...with high-altitude attitude.

12
00:00:25,126 --> 00:00:26,725
This would be outstanding
 in California.

13
00:00:26,727 --> 00:00:28,894
This is remarkable
all the way out here.

14
00:00:28,896 --> 00:00:30,996
Then in Long Beach,
   California...

15
00:00:30,998 --> 00:00:33,032
I'm a brain surgeon.
I just do it through
their belly.

16
00:00:33,034 --> 00:00:36,268
...a colorful bistro
 serving up local food...

17
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:37,970
It's a huge hit.
It's really delicious.

18
00:00:37,972 --> 00:00:40,005
...with artistic flair.

19
00:00:40,007 --> 00:00:41,240
You're painting
your own masterpieces.

20
00:00:41,242 --> 00:00:42,908
And in Carmel, California...

21
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:43,909
Calm down, G.
 You're dancing.

22
00:00:43,911 --> 00:00:44,977
Ooh!

23
00:00:44,979 --> 00:00:46,745
...tag-teaming with G. Garvin

24
00:00:46,747 --> 00:00:49,148
on some righteous
  East Coast Italian.

25
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:50,249
Just a bada, no bing.

26
00:00:50,251 --> 00:00:51,216
My man.

27
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:52,684
Three words.
  Forget about it.

28
00:00:52,686 --> 00:00:53,752
Ooh.

29
00:00:53,754 --> 00:00:55,954
That's all right here,
   right now,

30
00:00:55,956 --> 00:00:57,322
on "Triple D."

31
00:00:57,324 --> 00:01:00,325

33
00:01:09,437 --> 00:01:11,370
So, I'm here
 in this cool little town

34
00:01:11,372 --> 00:01:13,338
called Carmel-by-the-Sea,
   California.

35
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,474
Great restaurants,
 lots of cool little shops,

36
00:01:15,476 --> 00:01:17,309
and I'm hanging out
    with my buddy here,

37
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:18,977
G. Garvin
  from The Cooking Channel.

38
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:20,679
Now, G., I know
   what you're wanting.

39
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:23,115
You're saying, "Get me some
  really good barbecue sauce,

40
00:01:23,117 --> 00:01:25,217
some sweet potatoes --"
Oh! No barbecue.

41
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:26,652
Then how about Italian?

42
00:01:26,654 --> 00:01:27,920
This is Little Napoli.

43
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:33,158
Ravioli going down
 with the Arrabbiata sauce.

44
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,626
It's so good.
   And I just know

45
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:36,128
that I'm getting
  something authentic.

46
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:38,330
Chicken parmigiana, here we go.

47
00:01:38,332 --> 00:01:39,631
It just embraces everything

48
00:01:39,633 --> 00:01:41,133
that Italian life
  is supposed to be.

49
00:01:41,135 --> 00:01:44,870
That's because since
 1989, owner and chef Rich Pèpe

50
00:01:44,872 --> 00:01:47,306
has been serving up
   family recipes

51
00:01:47,308 --> 00:01:50,042
you don't usually see
  outside the boot.

52
00:01:50,044 --> 00:01:52,211
A lot of people
 don't understand

53
00:01:52,213 --> 00:01:54,213
how regional
 Italian food is.

54
00:01:54,215 --> 00:01:56,215
With all my grandparents
  coming from Southern Italy,

55
00:01:56,217 --> 00:01:57,483
that's where
    we really focus.

56
00:01:57,485 --> 00:01:58,650
That's what I grew up with.

57
00:01:58,652 --> 00:02:00,252
And also, being from
   New Jersey, you know,

58
00:02:00,254 --> 00:02:01,820
if you don't put good food
    on the table,

59
00:02:01,822 --> 00:02:03,422
somebody's gonna get hurt.
    Truly.

60
00:02:06,694 --> 00:02:08,527
Cannelloni tricolore, pick up.

61
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:09,628
Love the cannelloni.

62
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,697
It's such a surprise
  when it arrives.

63
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:14,666
It has red, white, and green
  like the Italian flag.

64
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:16,468
Tricolore.
 Three colors, my brother.

65
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,769
Come on!
    My man.

66
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:18,737
So, how we starting
  this off?

67
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:20,038
Working the stuffing
  right now?

68
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,106
Yes, sir.
Hit it.

69
00:02:21,108 --> 00:02:23,275
Pèppoli extra virgin
     olive oil,

70
00:02:23,277 --> 00:02:26,612
onions, zucchini,
 yellow squash, and mushrooms.

71
00:02:26,614 --> 00:02:29,248
Fresh ground pepper
    over the top.

72
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,116
Little bit of kosher salt.

73
00:02:31,118 --> 00:02:32,584
So, we're just gonna
    cook that down

74
00:02:32,586 --> 00:02:33,852
for just a couple
     of moments.

75
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:35,087
Just sweating it a bit.

76
00:02:35,089 --> 00:02:36,522
Just sweating it a bit
 'cause it will cook later on

77
00:02:36,524 --> 00:02:38,290
when we make
   the cannelloni roll.

78
00:02:38,292 --> 00:02:41,059
Chicken coming in.
  This is grilled chicken.
Okay.

79
00:02:41,061 --> 00:02:43,295
Just a little parsley
  at the end just to fold.

80
00:02:45,266 --> 00:02:46,231
Basically, that's done.

81
00:02:47,101 --> 00:02:48,534
Now we're gonna make
    the pesto sauce.
Got it.

82
00:02:48,536 --> 00:02:50,502
Garlic.
    Fresh basil.

83
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:52,571
A lot of it.

84
00:02:54,108 --> 00:02:55,107
Olive oil.

85
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:58,810
Parmigiano-reggiano.

86
00:02:58,812 --> 00:03:00,312
Blend it just
  for a couple of seconds.

87
00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:02,314
I don't want to heat
   that cheese up at all.

88
00:03:02,316 --> 00:03:04,616
I like you leave a little
texture to it. Okay.

89
00:03:04,618 --> 00:03:06,318
Let me get after that
   for you, boss.

90
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,753
Nice, G.

91
00:03:07,755 --> 00:03:09,721
Hey, man.
I'm over here helping.

92
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:10,956
G.'s digging
 in the back side.

93
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,491
Hey, I'm a guest
  on the show, baby.

94
00:03:12,493 --> 00:03:13,692
I get to do what I want to do.

95
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,594
Okay. Now we'll fold in
a little heavy cream.

96
00:03:15,596 --> 00:03:17,229
Now you make your own pasta,
  as well.

97
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:18,497
We do.
 Wow.

98
00:03:18,499 --> 00:03:20,332
Just a traditional...

99
00:03:20,334 --> 00:03:22,000
semolina and egg pasta.

100
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:24,870
And one, two, three.

101
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:27,172
Then go and boil it off,
 little salt water.

102
00:03:30,044 --> 00:03:31,376
So, this is our
    pre-boiled sheet.

103
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:32,744
Pipe in the ricotta

104
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:35,280
and parmesan and egg
    filling cheese.

105
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:36,248
Bada bing.

106
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,717
Did we just get
 a "bada bing"?

107
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,385
You got
    a little bada bing.
   Bada who?

108
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,187
A little shout out for Jersey.
    What can I say?

109
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:43,822
Now we can take
    our filling.

110
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:45,390
We're gonna lay it
     across.

111
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:46,792
We did let it cool down
    just a little bit.

112
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:50,729
Now we are just gonna
    fold it over,

113
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:52,431
making like a big burrito.

114
00:03:52,433 --> 00:03:53,799
We'll cut this whole piece
     in three.

115
00:03:53,801 --> 00:03:55,434
Now we're gonna go
    into the skillet

116
00:03:55,436 --> 00:03:57,803
with a little bit of water
 and we're gonna steam it up.

117
00:03:57,805 --> 00:03:59,805
Two, three minutes.
Two or three minutes.

118
00:03:59,807 --> 00:04:01,173
Just a bada, no bing.

119
00:04:01,175 --> 00:04:02,407
Then we're gonna plate
    this puppy up.

120
00:04:04,612 --> 00:04:06,445
Now I'm gonna come in
   with our three sauces.

121
00:04:06,447 --> 00:04:08,447
The marinara.

122
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:10,582
Pesto cream sauce.

123
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:11,583
And the Alfredo.

124
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:15,854
Shaved
   reggiano parmigiano.

125
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:17,155
Roasted pine nuts.

126
00:04:17,157 --> 00:04:18,357
Pea shoots.

127
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:20,025
I got to tell you.
  Just like the Italian flag.

128
00:04:20,027 --> 00:04:21,193
It is gorgeous.

129
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,400
We'll meet in the middle
like "Lady and the Tramp."

130
00:04:28,402 --> 00:04:29,234
Whoa.

131
00:04:30,137 --> 00:04:31,370
Calm down, G.
 You're dancing.

132
00:04:31,372 --> 00:04:32,604
Man.

133
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:33,538
Here we go.
  Get it out.

134
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,240
Three words.
  Forget about it.

135
00:04:35,242 --> 00:04:36,275
Ooh.

136
00:04:36,277 --> 00:04:37,909
That's the best compliment
    you can get.

137
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:39,544
To me,
one of the keys to this

138
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:41,713
that I'm really digging
 is the simplicity.

139
00:04:41,715 --> 00:04:44,816
You execute the pasta perfectly,
you make your own sauces.

140
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:46,485
But what makes the dish
  so great

141
00:04:46,487 --> 00:04:48,387
is with so many flavors
 on the plate,

142
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:50,622
there's no reason to make it
 any more complex.

143
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,924
Just let the simplicity of it
 shine through.

144
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:55,027
And that's really
what I enjoy the most.

145
00:04:55,029 --> 00:04:57,529
Man, it all works well together.
  It's phenomenal.

146
00:04:57,531 --> 00:04:59,064
Nice job, Pèpe.
      Thank you.

147
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:00,098
Excellent.

148
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,501
Tricolore cannelloni.

149
00:05:02,503 --> 00:05:05,637
Everything inside's very warm
 and fresh and delicious.

150
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:06,872
Everything tastes fabulous

151
00:05:06,874 --> 00:05:08,940
from the very beginning
  until the very end.

152
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:10,108
Cioppino rosso.

153
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,344
Okay.
Next up, what do we got?

154
00:05:12,346 --> 00:05:14,746
We're coming in now
  with the cioppino rosso.

155
00:05:14,748 --> 00:05:16,114
Ohh!
I'm ready.

156
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:17,182
So, here's the deal.

157
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:19,151
We're hanging out
 at Little Napoli

158
00:05:19,153 --> 00:05:21,219
in Carmel, California,
 on "Triple D"

159
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:23,388
with Chef Pèpe,
my man the G. Garvin.

160
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,289
See you in a minute.

161
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:33,965
Welcome back.

162
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:36,768
Guy Fieri hanging out here
at "Diners, Drive-Ins, & Dives"

163
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:37,969
with my buddy G. Garvin

164
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:40,672
and we are at Little Napoli
 with Chef Pèpe,

165
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:43,342
and we just had some cannelloni
 that would, what?

166
00:05:43,344 --> 00:05:45,777
Ooh, knock your mama
  out the rocking chair.

167
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:48,480
Knock your mama
 out the rock--

168
00:05:48,482 --> 00:05:50,782
We don't typically use
that line on "Triple D."

169
00:05:50,784 --> 00:05:52,651
Chef Pèpe,
we're gonna make cioppino.

170
00:05:52,653 --> 00:05:55,087
This is bouillabaisse
  gone wild.

171
00:05:55,089 --> 00:05:57,022
We're gonna make the sauce
 and we're gonna use the shells.

172
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:59,458
So I'm really just going
   to just rub some paste

173
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,759
through the shells

174
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:02,594
and just put them in the oven
   for about 15 minutes

175
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:03,595
just to get them warmed up.

176
00:06:03,597 --> 00:06:04,930
350 degrees?
    Yeah, maybe 350.

177
00:06:04,932 --> 00:06:06,198
Great.

178
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,667
In a warm stock pot,
   extra virgin olive oil.

179
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:10,902
Some red onion.
    Chopped garlic.

180
00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:13,138
Lots of it.
     Chopped celery.

181
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,307
Carrots.
    Saffron threads.

182
00:06:15,309 --> 00:06:17,409
Nice.
    Color and flavor.

183
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:21,046
All right, Chef.

184
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:24,349
You can see we've just kind
of caramelized the shells a bit,

185
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:26,785
roasted the tomato paste
  on there.

186
00:06:26,787 --> 00:06:28,387
Stir it up a little bit,
    bring them all...

187
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:30,288
Deglaze
   with some white wine.

188
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,690
Come in
  with some ground tomatoes.

189
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:35,761
Crushed red pepper.

190
00:06:37,164 --> 00:06:38,630
Oregano.

191
00:06:38,632 --> 00:06:40,098
Fair amount of salt.

192
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,200
Good little stir.

193
00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:43,468
How long
  do you let it cook for?

194
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,303
Top on, we got
   about 15, 20 minutes.

195
00:06:45,305 --> 00:06:47,773
Pull it, strain it.
      Exactly.

196
00:06:47,775 --> 00:06:49,841
And we use the immersion blender
     on it.

197
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:50,976
Cioppino sauce is done.

198
00:06:50,978 --> 00:06:52,310
The bada bing.

199
00:06:52,312 --> 00:06:53,879
He says "bada bing"
 one more time,

200
00:06:53,881 --> 00:06:55,781
I'm gonna kick<i> him</i> out
of the rocking chair.

201
00:06:55,783 --> 00:06:57,115
The bada bing.

202
00:06:57,117 --> 00:06:59,117
Now we're putting it
  together.

203
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:00,752
Extra virgin olive oil.

204
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,220
Shallot.

205
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:03,722
Manila clams.

206
00:07:03,724 --> 00:07:05,357
Black mussels.

207
00:07:05,359 --> 00:07:06,625
Calamari.

208
00:07:06,627 --> 00:07:07,726
White prawns.

209
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:10,195
Scallops.

210
00:07:10,197 --> 00:07:11,963
Calamari tentacles.

211
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:13,165
Crab claw.

212
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:14,065
Baby shrimp.

213
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:16,568
Stir it up a little bit.

214
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:19,971
Deglaze with white wine,
     Chardonnay.

215
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:20,972
Reduce it down.

216
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:24,443
Cioppino sauce
   that we made earlier

217
00:07:24,445 --> 00:07:26,645
coming right over the top.

218
00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:28,880
And as soon as that's hot
and those clams open,

219
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:29,781
we're good to go.

220
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:31,783
We're done.
    Cover it up.

221
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,552
2, 3, 4 minutes,
    you're finished.
Got it.

222
00:07:33,554 --> 00:07:35,654
Fresh pasta going down
   in the boiling water.

223
00:07:35,656 --> 00:07:37,389
Let's take a look
    at our cioppino.

224
00:07:37,391 --> 00:07:38,623
Mmm, it's gorgeous.

225
00:07:40,027 --> 00:07:41,827
Pasta coming out
    of the water.

226
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:43,295
Oh!
 Look at that.

227
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:45,831
A little sauce
    over the top.

228
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:49,968
And now we are gonna go in
    with our seafood.

229
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,404
Look at this.
    Right over the top.

230
00:07:52,406 --> 00:07:55,040
That's like grandma
    used to make.

231
00:07:55,042 --> 00:07:56,408
Fresh parsley over the top.

232
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:58,310
Little chili oil
    over the top.

233
00:07:58,312 --> 00:07:59,778
Ohh.

234
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,246
I don't want to hurt you.
 I don't want to hurt you now.

235
00:08:01,248 --> 00:08:03,114
Cioppino rosso.

236
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:04,115
You make the pasta,
 you make the sauce,

237
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:05,317
you roast the shells,

238
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:07,385
you live in the house
 of Pèpeville.

239
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:10,722
Oh, the sauce is bananas.

240
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:13,859
Nice spice to it.
Pasta's not overcooked.

241
00:08:13,861 --> 00:08:16,795
This is spicy, just the right
   amount of heat.

242
00:08:16,797 --> 00:08:18,997
It's gorgeous.
  Oh, it's spot-on.

243
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,165
I make cioppino.

244
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:22,934
It's one of my favorite
 personal dishes.

245
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:24,002
This is outstanding.

246
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:25,303
Oh, yeah.
    That means a lot.

247
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:27,806
Thank you.
 Mmm.

248
00:08:27,808 --> 00:08:29,508
Okay.
 Now I'm done.

249
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:32,978
Cioppino rosso.
     Andiamo.

250
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:35,847
It makes you feel like
 you're in the Italian coast

251
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,749
with fresh seafood that
 just jumps out of the water.

252
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:40,285
It's pretty much the only place
 that we can come and get it

253
00:08:40,287 --> 00:08:42,220
where it's very similar
 to how we make it at home.

254
00:08:42,222 --> 00:08:44,122
Pèpe knows exactly
  what he's doing.

255
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:45,724
Little bit of shallots.

256
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:47,626
What you've done,
how you're doing it,

257
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:49,494
you're a lover
of the Italian culture,

258
00:08:49,496 --> 00:08:50,962
and you really exude that.

259
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:52,597
Wonderful.
Very nice to meet you,
  Chef.

260
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,703
Coming up,
  in Jackson, Wyoming...

261
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:00,338
I can't shovel this in
    fast enough.

262
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,707
...Mexican-made
  with old-school style.

263
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,276
This is the only one in Jackson.
   I'm pretty sure of it.

264
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:05,243
That's gangster.

265
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,586
So, I'm here
  in Jackson, Wyoming,

266
00:09:14,588 --> 00:09:16,421
and I'm about two miles
  from the center of town

267
00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:18,056
over in kind of
  the locals' area.

268
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:20,492
Now, when you think of Jackson,
  what do you think of?

269
00:09:20,494 --> 00:09:21,927
Well, of course, outdoor sports.

270
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:23,995
But when it comes to food,
  what kind of food?

271
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:26,464
Well, one of the first that
 would come up is wild game.

272
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:28,099
Then you'd have
  some steakhouses.

273
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:29,568
But do you think
  of Mexican food?

274
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,303
Well, you don't
 until you try this joint.

275
00:09:31,305 --> 00:09:32,470
This is Pica's.

276
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:38,143
Marinated shrimp tacos.

277
00:09:38,145 --> 00:09:39,611
You can tell
 that what they're making,

278
00:09:39,613 --> 00:09:41,479
they're making because
 they love what they're doing.

279
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:42,781
Chicken mole plate.

280
00:09:42,783 --> 00:09:44,649
You know, it's like
 when you go down to Mexico

281
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:47,786
and someone fixes you a dish
 in a place you'd never expect.

282
00:09:47,788 --> 00:09:49,287
That's what you get here.

283
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:52,257
That someone is chef
 and owner Andy Parazette,

284
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:54,526
a So-Cal dude
 who left behind the surf

285
00:09:54,528 --> 00:09:57,896
to open up this mountain
  taqueria in 2001.

286
00:09:57,898 --> 00:09:58,964
Were you always
in the restaurant business?

287
00:09:58,966 --> 00:10:00,966
After college,
    I started cooking

288
00:10:00,968 --> 00:10:02,767
and learned
    different dishes

289
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,703
from different parts
     of Mexico.

290
00:10:04,705 --> 00:10:06,838
Tinga sopes up.

291
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,208
The sopes are so homemade.
  They're delicious.

292
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:12,143
What are you gonna make us?

293
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:14,980
We're gonna make
   tinga chicken sopes.

294
00:10:14,982 --> 00:10:16,681
Tinga?
 What's tinga?

295
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:19,184
That's a traditional
  Mexican type of chicken.

296
00:10:19,186 --> 00:10:20,218
Get going.
 I'm starving.

297
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,419
All right.

298
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:24,856
So, this is the dried masa,
    salt, water.

299
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:26,992
There you go.

300
00:10:26,994 --> 00:10:28,627
Done.
  Good.

301
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:30,662
This is about
as old-school real deal --

302
00:10:30,664 --> 00:10:31,730
where did this one
  come from?

303
00:10:31,732 --> 00:10:33,064
Down in Mexico.

304
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:35,066
This is the only one in Jackson.
   I'm pretty sure of it.

305
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:36,267
That's gangster.

306
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:39,404
Now we're gonna roll the masa
     into balls.

307
00:10:39,406 --> 00:10:41,573
Over the plastic.

308
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:46,177
You don't press it
     too hard.

309
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:48,446
You want to keep them
    a little thick.

310
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:50,815
All right.
    So, you take it.

311
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:51,983
And when we make the sope,

312
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,184
especially with
    this tinga chicken,

313
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:54,552
it's gonna have
   some moisture to it.

314
00:10:54,554 --> 00:10:56,321
So this kind of gives it
  a little well to sit in.

315
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:57,555
Yeah.
     Okay. Let's go.

316
00:10:57,557 --> 00:10:59,858
Now we make
 the chicken tinga.
       Hit it.

317
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:00,825
Canola oil.

318
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,594
Heat up julienned onions.

319
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:06,698
So, the onions
 are caramelized.

320
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,333
Now the chicken?
     The chicken.

321
00:11:10,404 --> 00:11:12,003
And you pour
    the tinga salsa.

322
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:14,706
Tinga salsa has
    guajillo chillies,

323
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:17,809
Morita chillies,
  fresh tomatoes, and beer.

324
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:19,110
Dried Mexican oregano.

325
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:21,613
So, cook this down,
let the chicken absorb

326
00:11:21,615 --> 00:11:23,114
all of this great flavor.

327
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:25,884
We cook it
   for about 30 minutes.

328
00:11:25,886 --> 00:11:26,918
Okay, brother.

329
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,986
Chicken tinga is done.

330
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:29,320
Sopes down.

331
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:31,222
You just put a little fry
  on these.

332
00:11:31,224 --> 00:11:32,457
They'll still be tender.

333
00:11:34,594 --> 00:11:36,327
If you've never had
 a sope before,

334
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:37,529
you have got to try them.

335
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:38,797
One of my favorite things.

336
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:39,831
What kind of beans
 are we using?

337
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,866
We're using refried beans.
Okay.

338
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:43,201
With lard?
     With lard.

339
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:44,569
Yes!

340
00:11:44,571 --> 00:11:46,471
Our chicken tinga.

341
00:11:48,942 --> 00:11:51,543
Romaine lettuce,
 white onion.

342
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:53,745
There were sopes at the bottom
    of this earlier.

343
00:11:53,747 --> 00:11:55,080
Tomato.

344
00:11:55,082 --> 00:11:56,514
Chipotle salsa.

345
00:11:56,516 --> 00:11:58,083
Mexican cheese.

346
00:11:58,085 --> 00:11:59,617
Sour cream.

347
00:12:04,491 --> 00:12:06,558
It's outrageous.

348
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,394
I can't shovel this in
    fast enough.

349
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:12,063
The sauce fits.
 The sopes got a little crunch.

350
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:15,233
Nice and thin.
   Holds together well.

351
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:17,001
Mmm.
    Outstanding.

352
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:18,002
All right.

353
00:12:21,174 --> 00:12:23,808
Well, the chicken
  is super tender,

354
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,110
kind of falls apart
  when you bite it.

355
00:12:25,112 --> 00:12:27,412
The sauces are amazing.
    I love the sauces.

356
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:29,047
Everybody in town
  comes to Pica's.
This is the place to go.

357
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:30,982
Here are your tacos al pastor.

358
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:32,851
You get kind of a melting pot
    here of folks,

359
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:34,085
you know, that come
    to Jackson Hole.

360
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:37,489
We get people from Texas,
  New Mexico, California.

361
00:12:37,491 --> 00:12:39,057
All those different people

362
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:40,825
have different ideas
     of what --

363
00:12:40,827 --> 00:12:43,261
Different expectations.
  ...Mexican food is, yeah.

364
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:44,929
We're from Ecuador.

365
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:46,064
What do you think
    of this food?

366
00:12:46,066 --> 00:12:49,200
I come to this place
two to three times a week.

367
00:12:49,202 --> 00:12:51,603
My whole family likes it.
  I bring my kids here.

368
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:53,538
Posole verde.

369
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,507
Posole, for me, is
  a comfort food, you know?

370
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:57,142
It's extremely fresh.

371
00:12:57,144 --> 00:12:59,544
The cabbage, the pork,
  everything is just --

372
00:12:59,546 --> 00:13:01,212
it's amazing.

373
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:03,448
So, we're gonna do
   the pork posole verde.

374
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,783
And so, what we have here

375
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:07,352
is fresh tomatillos
    and jalapeños.

376
00:13:07,354 --> 00:13:09,754
Next we take water
    and fill it.

377
00:13:09,756 --> 00:13:12,690
They're gonna cook
   for about 25 minutes.

378
00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:14,959
We're gonna take a sauté pan

379
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:18,196
and take julienned onions
     and garlic.

380
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:19,564
And let that just sit
and caramelize down.

381
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:21,366
Yep.
 So, we're gonna strain this.

382
00:13:23,537 --> 00:13:25,603
And then we'll puree them.
       Yes.

383
00:13:28,542 --> 00:13:30,708
And then we add
    a little cumin.
Ground cumin.

384
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:33,344
Let 'er rip.

385
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:37,549
So, now we're gonna take
the blended-up tomatillo

386
00:13:37,551 --> 00:13:40,051
and jalapeños and refry it
  in the pot.

387
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:42,620
Then we're gonna add
 the chicken stock

388
00:13:42,622 --> 00:13:44,589
and our salt and pepper.

389
00:13:44,591 --> 00:13:48,493
While that's cooking,
I'm gonna cut up our pork.

390
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,831
And we're gonna cook it
   in this pan with what?

391
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,666
Yellow onion and garlic.

392
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:57,969
And cook that
for about 45 minutes.

393
00:13:57,971 --> 00:13:59,137
All right.
 Pork's ready to go.

394
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:01,339
Everybody in the pool.

395
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:02,173
Big splash.

396
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:03,975
And our hominy.

397
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:08,079
And we let it cook for
  another 20 to 30 minutes.

398
00:14:08,815 --> 00:14:09,781
All right.

399
00:14:14,221 --> 00:14:16,120
So, fresh cabbage.

400
00:14:16,122 --> 00:14:17,255
Fresh onion.

401
00:14:17,257 --> 00:14:18,356
Mexican cheese.

402
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:19,524
Fresh cilantro.

403
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:21,359
Twist of lime.

404
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:22,961
And the fried tortilla.

405
00:14:25,765 --> 00:14:27,532
Got a little Valentina
  hot sauce?

406
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:30,835
Mm.

407
00:14:30,837 --> 00:14:32,403
And not that this needs
  hot sauce,

408
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:34,973
but there's just something about
all the times I've had posole

409
00:14:34,975 --> 00:14:36,708
that I got to have
a little bit of that tang.

410
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,982
It's the freshness
 of the cilantro

411
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:46,084
and the crunch of the onion
 and the cabbage.

412
00:14:47,921 --> 00:14:50,255
And the pork is ridiculous,
 fall-apart tender.

413
00:14:50,257 --> 00:14:52,390
Mmm!

414
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:53,992
Snap!

415
00:14:53,994 --> 00:14:56,394
There's your posole verde.

416
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:57,962
It's kind of addicting.

417
00:14:57,964 --> 00:15:01,266
The spicy
 with the sweet and tangy.

418
00:15:01,268 --> 00:15:05,436
When you live in a destination
 resort like Jackson Hole,

419
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:08,406
one of the places you always
  recommend is Pica's.

420
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:09,540
And I'm gonna tell you
 something, man.

421
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:11,976
This would be outstanding
 in California.

422
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:13,578
This is remarkable
all the way out here.

423
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,046
Great job.
     Thanks a lot.

424
00:15:18,652 --> 00:15:22,587
Up next, an artist/chef
 in Long Beach, California...

425
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:23,655
Au jus!

426
00:15:23,657 --> 00:15:25,790
...working
  her culinary canvas...

427
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:27,792
That's a rock-star dish.
 Nice job, girl.

428
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:30,094
...with a full rainbow
   of flavors.

429
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:31,796
Ladies and gentlemen,
give it up for the chef.

430
00:15:38,638 --> 00:15:41,873
So, I'm here on Atlantic Avenue
 in Long Beach, California,

431
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:45,043
in the Bixby Knolls neighborhood
  to check out a joint

432
00:15:45,045 --> 00:15:47,946
where the chef/artist
 is painting her creativity

433
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:49,814
on the canvas and the plate.

434
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:51,649
This is The Factory Gastrobar.

435
00:15:55,588 --> 00:15:56,921
Au jus!

436
00:15:56,923 --> 00:16:00,425
Presentation is great.
 The ingredients are different.

437
00:16:00,427 --> 00:16:01,993
The menu changes constantly.

438
00:16:01,995 --> 00:16:04,329
Spanish fish tacos
    in the window.

439
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:07,265
Self-taught chef and owner
  Natalie Gutenkauf

440
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:09,901
opened this comfort-food joint
   in 2009,

441
00:16:09,903 --> 00:16:13,271
combining her two loves --
   art and food.

442
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:14,639
Order up!

443
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:15,907
This is all
you've wanted to do,

444
00:16:15,909 --> 00:16:17,108
be in
the restaurant business?

445
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,276
No.
 Okay.

446
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:19,677
I wanted to be a brain surgeon.

447
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:21,512
Awesome.
 Aren't we all?

448
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:23,781
I'm a brain surgeon.
I just do it through
their belly.

449
00:16:23,783 --> 00:16:24,816
Exactly.

450
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:28,252
Asparagus sandwich!
     Order up!

451
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:30,488
It's a wonderful combination

452
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,957
of fresh asparagus,
  arugula, tomato.

453
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,159
Absolutely amazing.

454
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:36,494
It's so delicious.

455
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:38,830
What's the first thing
we're gonna work on?

456
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:40,598
A white-bean hummus.

457
00:16:41,568 --> 00:16:43,835
These are already
   cooked-off white beans.
Got it.

458
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:45,403
Whole garlic.
A bunch of it.

459
00:16:45,405 --> 00:16:46,904
Fresh basil.

460
00:16:46,906 --> 00:16:49,207
Next is some fresh-squeezed
    lemon juice.

461
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:50,475
And a little S and P.

462
00:16:50,477 --> 00:16:52,977
All right.
   Get this baby on here.

463
00:16:53,947 --> 00:16:56,814
We're gonna add
  a little bit of olive oil.

464
00:16:56,816 --> 00:16:58,716
So, that's done.
 What's next?

465
00:16:58,718 --> 00:17:00,618
We're gonna make
    the sandwich.
 Awesome.

466
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,786
Asparagus.
Got it.

467
00:17:01,788 --> 00:17:03,821
Little salt and pepper.

468
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:06,057
And...can you guess
    what this oil?

469
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:08,126
Hop oil.
      Fantastic.

470
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:09,694
It is.
I love hops.

471
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:12,063
So, all it is,
    is olive oil, hops,

472
00:17:12,065 --> 00:17:13,531
little bit of lemon rinds.

473
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:15,500
Kind of get it
    juiced up there.

474
00:17:15,502 --> 00:17:16,601
Put it on the grill.

475
00:17:16,603 --> 00:17:18,636
Let it sit there
   for a couple minutes.

476
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:21,372
A nice thick slice
    of red onion.
Great.

477
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:22,440
This is ciabatta bread.

478
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:24,308
Just get a little grill marks
     on it.

479
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,376
Arugula.

480
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:28,179
Little spoonful
    of the dressing.

481
00:17:28,181 --> 00:17:29,313
Get that mixed in.

482
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:31,949
We've got our ciabatta
    grilled up here.

483
00:17:31,951 --> 00:17:34,352
White bean
    and basil hummus.

484
00:17:34,354 --> 00:17:36,687
Baby arugula salad.

485
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:38,456
Grilled onion on here.

486
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,825
And our asparagus.

487
00:17:40,827 --> 00:17:43,127
A little
   yellow tomatoes here.

488
00:17:43,129 --> 00:17:44,762
Fresno chilies.

489
00:17:44,764 --> 00:17:46,831
Roasted red bell pepper.

490
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,433
And hop oil.

491
00:17:48,435 --> 00:17:50,001
Hop over there.

492
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:55,540
That is gorgeous.

493
00:17:57,777 --> 00:18:00,411
From the crunchiness
 of the bread

494
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:01,779
to the garlic in the hummus

495
00:18:01,781 --> 00:18:04,615
to the asparagus
and to the char of the onion,

496
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:06,350
the notes go on
 and on and on.

497
00:18:10,223 --> 00:18:12,857
It's a huge hit.
It's really delicious.

498
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:14,826
It's beautiful.
 It's balanced.

499
00:18:14,828 --> 00:18:17,328
That's a rock-star dish.
 Nice job, girl.

500
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:20,331
I've had great
   vegetarian sandwiches.

501
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,667
But I got to say
  that this is up in the top.

502
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:24,469
This is by far --
 yes, I agree.

503
00:18:24,471 --> 00:18:26,170
It's very refreshing.

504
00:18:26,172 --> 00:18:28,840
The crisp arugula, the yellow
tomatoes -- it's a smash.

505
00:18:28,842 --> 00:18:30,208
It is.
    It really is.

506
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:33,044
Always fresh and
 you can taste the difference.

507
00:18:33,046 --> 00:18:35,046
That's one of the things I love
  about The Factory.

508
00:18:35,048 --> 00:18:36,147
How'd you come up
 with the name?

509
00:18:36,149 --> 00:18:38,816
It's after Andy Warhol's factory
    in New York.

510
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:40,251
And they created
    an art scene.

511
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:42,153
And I kind of have
   that same concept here,

512
00:18:42,155 --> 00:18:43,154
but it's a food scene.

513
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:44,388
It's art on a plate.

514
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:48,593
Plating the pig and grits.

515
00:18:48,595 --> 00:18:49,927
You got the pork going on.
  You got some capers.

516
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:51,395
You got onions.
  You got carrots.

517
00:18:51,397 --> 00:18:53,998
The pig and grits lines your
 stomach with some good loving.

518
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:57,568
Beautiful pork butt.

519
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,570
Seasoned with a little bit
   of salt and pepper.

520
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:01,405
We just want to brown it up.

521
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:03,341
Hear a sizzle.
     We're good.

522
00:19:05,044 --> 00:19:08,479
All right.
So we're seared on both sides?

523
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:15,653
We're gonna add some onions,
  garlic, and the best part.

524
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,188
Now, this is an amber ale.

525
00:19:18,224 --> 00:19:20,057
You're gonna pour that hot fat
 on top of that?

526
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:21,526
Absolutely.

527
00:19:21,528 --> 00:19:24,795
You want to get every bit
   of the flavor in here.

528
00:19:24,797 --> 00:19:25,997
This is gonna go
    in the oven.

529
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:28,032
What temp?
      About 250.

530
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:30,835
And it's gonna cook
 for about three to four hours.

531
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:32,837
Okay.
 What's next?

532
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:34,605
We need to do the grits.

533
00:19:36,576 --> 00:19:38,843
Scoop some of this
   pork au jus in here.

534
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:39,911
Nice.

535
00:19:39,913 --> 00:19:42,313
This is
   Hepp's alderwood salt.

536
00:19:42,315 --> 00:19:44,649
Get a real nice
    smoky flavor.

537
00:19:46,085 --> 00:19:49,353
And we're gonna put it
   into our boat here.

538
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:51,689
Next, we're gonna get
    some pork out.

539
00:19:54,294 --> 00:19:56,394
Candied carrots.

540
00:19:56,396 --> 00:19:59,197
And blackened tomatoes.

541
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:01,999
And we're gonna put a dollop
   of chimichurri sauce.

542
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:03,301
These are capers,
     big capers.

543
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,203
Dried figs.

544
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:06,771
Cilantro.

545
00:20:06,773 --> 00:20:08,573
Ta-da!
 La-ba!

546
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:11,008
Wow, there's a lot
  going on.

547
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:17,048
When you get that bite
of the grits with the salt,

548
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,417
the chimichurri, and
that beer-roasted pork,

549
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:21,552
it really has all the depth
 that you need.

550
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:24,121
It's really dynamite.

551
00:20:24,123 --> 00:20:26,357
Fire, fire!

552
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:29,327
Pork is just slow-cooked.
  It just falls apart.

553
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:31,596
This is very distinctive
   and unique.

554
00:20:31,598 --> 00:20:34,198
There is nothing else
  in this area like it.

555
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,133
You're painting your own
masterpieces and it's unique.

556
00:20:36,135 --> 00:20:37,802
Ladies and gentlemen,
give it up for the chef.

557
00:20:41,641 --> 00:20:43,874
So, that's it for
 this trip, but don't worry.

558
00:20:43,876 --> 00:20:46,711
There's plenty more "Triple D"
 joints all over the country!

559
00:20:46,713 --> 00:20:48,713
I'll be looking for you
   next week

560
00:20:48,715 --> 00:20:50,748
on "Diners, Drive-ins,
   and Dives."

561
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,882
Just so you know,

562
00:20:51,884 --> 00:20:53,384
the show was over, like,
 five minutes ago,

563
00:20:53,386 --> 00:20:55,720
but we are continuing
 to mow this down.

564
00:20:55,722 --> 00:20:57,188
"Triple D" after hours.

565
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:59,290
Behind the scenes.
    Mmm!

1
00:00:01,102 --> 00:00:02,167
Hey, everybody.

2
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:03,635
I'm Guy Fieri,
  and we're rolling out

3
00:00:03,637 --> 00:00:07,239
looking for America's greatest
 diners, drive-ins, and dives.

4
00:00:07,241 --> 00:00:09,308
This trip...
       Wow!

5
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:11,710
...we're headed to
  the Flavortown pool...

6
00:00:11,712 --> 00:00:13,112
Ooh, that sounds nice.

7
00:00:13,114 --> 00:00:14,380
...and diving into
  some all-day dining...

8
00:00:14,382 --> 00:00:15,981
s just turned on.
   Ooh, that sounds nice.

9
00:00:15,983 --> 00:00:17,549
...in Wilson, Wyoming...

10
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:18,450
Look at that.
    Get after it.

11
00:00:18,452 --> 00:00:20,285
...a down-home joint...

12
00:00:20,287 --> 00:00:22,054
Ooh, you know the knuckles.
    I like this one.

13
00:00:22,056 --> 00:00:24,590
...stacking up
 an early-morning classic.

14
00:00:24,592 --> 00:00:26,191
That's gourmet
    French toast.

15
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:27,192
In Monterey, California...

16
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:28,560
Hello.

17
00:00:28,562 --> 00:00:30,929
...a chef living the fresh
  and local life...

18
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:32,131
Nice job.

19
00:00:32,133 --> 00:00:34,566
...pulling off a triple play
   of pork.

20
00:00:34,568 --> 00:00:36,402
Well, here at
the delicate Wild Plum,

21
00:00:36,404 --> 00:00:38,904
don't think you're not getting
a chuck wagon portion.

22
00:00:38,906 --> 00:00:41,073
And in Long Beach, California...

23
00:00:41,075 --> 00:00:42,341
Hey!
      Hey!

24
00:00:42,343 --> 00:00:44,943
...a gastro pub
  mixing up the menu...

25
00:00:44,945 --> 00:00:46,445
Oh, I'm sorry.
    Back up the one.

26
00:00:46,447 --> 00:00:48,647
...with some
  off-the-hook creations.

27
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:49,648
Shut the front door.

28
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:50,816
Shut the front
    and the back door.

29
00:00:50,818 --> 00:00:52,851
That's all right here,
   right now,

30
00:00:52,853 --> 00:00:54,319
on "Triple D."

33
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:09,001
So, I'm here in the great state
   of Wyoming,

34
00:01:09,003 --> 00:01:10,502
right on Highway 22,

35
00:01:10,504 --> 00:01:13,439
about 6 or 7 miles west
  of Jackson Hole.

36
00:01:13,441 --> 00:01:15,707
I mean, everybody knows
 about Jackson Hole, right?

37
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:18,310
So I'm here to check out this
 family-run neighborhood joint

38
00:01:18,312 --> 00:01:20,179
where they are
 scratch making everything

39
00:01:20,181 --> 00:01:21,780
for breakfast, lunch,
   and dinner.

40
00:01:21,782 --> 00:01:23,115
This is Nora's Fish Creek Inn.

41
00:01:25,986 --> 00:01:28,087
Prime rib, baked potato!

42
00:01:28,089 --> 00:01:30,289
A unique little log cabin.

43
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:32,224
There's a giant fish on the top.

44
00:01:32,226 --> 00:01:34,793
It's a normal Joe place
 that you feel comfortable,

45
00:01:34,795 --> 00:01:37,396
and there's great food.

46
00:01:37,398 --> 00:01:38,897
Blue cheese mushrooms, please!

47
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:45,304
I've been coming here
  for 30-plus years,

48
00:01:45,306 --> 00:01:47,139
watching Kat grow up here.

49
00:01:47,141 --> 00:01:49,374
Working for her mother,
   Nora Tygum,

50
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:51,977
who started the joint
   back in '82,

51
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:55,114
now Kat's picking up
  where mother left off.

52
00:01:55,116 --> 00:01:57,082
I've modified a lot
   of her recipes,

53
00:01:57,084 --> 00:01:59,918
but a lot of them I keep
 the same because it's Nora's.

54
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,087
The food here is excellent.

55
00:02:02,089 --> 00:02:04,056
Any meal here, any day.

56
00:02:04,058 --> 00:02:06,191
It's one of our favorite places
  to have breakfast.

57
00:02:06,193 --> 00:02:08,961
Biscuit and gravy
 and the huevos rancheros.

58
00:02:08,963 --> 00:02:10,729
The pancakes, the French toast.

59
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:12,931
Banana bread French toast!
   It's fantastic.

60
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:17,436
Banana bread sourdough
  whole-wheat French toast.

61
00:02:17,438 --> 00:02:18,770
Wow!
    Let's do this.

62
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:22,574
Brown sugar, white sugar,
and a pound of butter.

63
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:24,243
Cream this.

64
00:02:24,245 --> 00:02:25,711
Look at that.
    Get after it.

65
00:02:25,713 --> 00:02:29,414
Now I'm gonna add the eggs,
a couple at a time, mix again.

66
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:34,052
Now I'll add my sourdough.

67
00:02:34,054 --> 00:02:35,387
Flavor jets just turned on.

68
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:37,856
White flour,
 whole-wheat flour,

69
00:02:37,858 --> 00:02:42,261
salt, soda,
 nutmeg, cinnamon.

70
00:02:42,263 --> 00:02:43,762
Allspice.

71
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:44,730
Clove?
A little clove.

72
00:02:44,732 --> 00:02:45,731
And some baking powder.

73
00:02:45,733 --> 00:02:47,599
Correct.

74
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:49,334
Now we're going to add
 the dry ingredients

75
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:51,069
to the wet ingredients,
 and I'll mix this.

76
00:02:55,376 --> 00:02:58,877
Then I mash up the bananas,

77
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,512
and then
 I'll scoop them in.

78
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:03,115
And then you're going to put
   the mixer back to --

79
00:03:03,117 --> 00:03:04,216
Back to work.

80
00:03:05,753 --> 00:03:08,620
A little
    labor of love here.

81
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:10,989
I like to let it sit
for about 30 minutes.

82
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:13,192
Hit it
   with a little Aqua Net.

83
00:03:13,194 --> 00:03:15,460
Then I'm gonna pour it
  in the pan.

84
00:03:16,297 --> 00:03:18,096
325 for an hour?
Yep.

85
00:03:22,236 --> 00:03:23,635
All right,
 so, bread's cooled down now.

86
00:03:26,073 --> 00:03:29,741
It's three slices,
50/50 margarine and butter,

87
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:30,842
dip it in my eggs.

88
00:03:30,844 --> 00:03:32,778
Did we put any milk
     in the egg?

89
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:33,745
Nope, just egg.

90
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:34,913
Put it on the flat top.

91
00:03:36,517 --> 00:03:39,384
Look at that omelette you have
  on the outside of that.

92
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:40,819
Plate this up.

93
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:47,960
Powdered sugar, walnuts,
and some blueberries.

94
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,997
Breakfast avalanche you got
   going on over here.

95
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:01,240
That's gourmet
    French toast.

96
00:04:01,242 --> 00:04:04,109
The whole wheat,
    the bananas,

97
00:04:04,111 --> 00:04:07,145
I mean, the whole spice cabinet
   jumped in this one.

98
00:04:07,147 --> 00:04:09,448
I love the allspice
    getting in there.

99
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,416
There's enough sweetness
     in there,

100
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:13,652
and the natural sweetness
 of the blueberries coming in.

101
00:04:13,654 --> 00:04:14,953
Nicely done.
Awesome.

102
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:16,221
Ooh, you know the knuckles.
 I do.

103
00:04:16,223 --> 00:04:17,623
I like this one.

104
00:04:19,994 --> 00:04:22,227
The banana bread
  is just unbelievable.

105
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:26,331
I love it so much that I just
  want to keep eating it.

106
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,599
You look out your window,

107
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:29,534
and you see the Teton Mountains
   all around you.

108
00:04:29,536 --> 00:04:33,238
You can't take it for granted
 because it's just so beautiful.

109
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,340
We come here a lot during
 the week, during lunches.

110
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:37,442
Dinner, I have stroganoff
   or prime rib.

111
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:40,779
Or why not have both
  at the same time?

112
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:43,181
Pick up, stroganoff!

113
00:04:43,183 --> 00:04:45,317
You make your beef stroganoff
    with prime rib?

114
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:46,251
Leftover prime rib.

115
00:04:46,253 --> 00:04:47,786
So you'll serve this
     for dinner.

116
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:50,088
You have your end trimmings,
  your leftover prime rib,

117
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:51,790
then you'll take that,
    slice that up,

118
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,458
and use that to make
    the stroganoff.

119
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,393
Correct.
     Got it.

120
00:04:56,063 --> 00:04:57,396
All right,
    let's get into it.

121
00:04:57,398 --> 00:04:59,097
We're making the homemade
noodles for the beef stroganoff.

122
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:00,966
So, all-purpose flour.

123
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:05,270
A little salt, milk,
  my eggs.

124
00:05:05,272 --> 00:05:07,839
And some clarified butter.
       Got it.

125
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:09,508
Mix it up with my hands,

126
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:12,444
and I'm gonna knead it
 to a nice ball.

127
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:17,082
And then I'm gonna
 flour my surface

128
00:05:17,084 --> 00:05:19,918
so they don't
 stick together.

129
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:24,890
Roll it out, cut it in half,
 and roll it up.

130
00:05:26,226 --> 00:05:27,125
Slice it.

131
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:28,694
Big, hearty noodles.

132
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:32,364
Unroll 'em,
kind of break 'em apart,

133
00:05:32,366 --> 00:05:34,533
let 'em dry out a little bit
on this cookie sheet.

134
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:36,435
Okay,
  so we bust all this out.

135
00:05:36,437 --> 00:05:39,404
Okay, so now we're gonna make
    the stroganoff.

136
00:05:39,406 --> 00:05:40,605
Yes.

137
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:41,740
So, we got
   the clarified butter.

138
00:05:41,742 --> 00:05:46,144
Melting with my garlic,
 mushrooms, onions.

139
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:47,846
Let this sauté up
 a little bit.

140
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:52,884
I'll add my flour,
building a little roux.

141
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:55,887
Then I'm gonna add
the leftover prime rib,

142
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:57,589
half and half, tarragon,

143
00:05:57,591 --> 00:06:03,095
cracked black pepper,
chicken stock, wine.

144
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:05,564
So, in the winter months,

145
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:07,733
when everybody's
   freezing cold up here,

146
00:06:07,735 --> 00:06:09,468
this has got to be a hit.
Yes.

147
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,770
What temperatures on
  a daily basis in December?

148
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:12,637
Minus 28.

149
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,605
Your hair freezes.

150
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:14,873
That's what happened.

151
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,743
Let that come to a boil.

152
00:06:17,745 --> 00:06:19,144
I'm gonna drop my noodles.

153
00:06:19,146 --> 00:06:20,779
Noodles have puffed up.

154
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:32,991
Here's what I dig.
    Super creamy.

155
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:34,659
I love the tarragon
     in there.

156
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:35,961
You get a ton of meat.

157
00:06:35,963 --> 00:06:38,597
You get a nice, big, fat,
   hand-rolled noodle.

158
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:43,335
So it used to be
  just on Wednesdays, huh?

159
00:06:43,337 --> 00:06:44,503
Yep.

160
00:06:44,505 --> 00:06:45,804
I guess I'll have to put it
 on the menu.

161
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:46,838
That's me working
    for you guys.

162
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,873
Nice job, girl.

163
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,741
Excellent. Delicious.

164
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,309
The beef stroganoff.

165
00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:54,479
The best thing about it is the
mushroom sauce that's cooked in.

166
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:57,315
I really enjoy
  the homemade noodles.

167
00:06:57,317 --> 00:06:59,117
I mean, you don't get them
   very often.

168
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:00,752
So, this is still
 a locals joint?

169
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,487
Very much local.

170
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:03,255
You might change that.

171
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:04,556
It's not me.

172
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:06,491
You're the ones that said,
 "Come here."

173
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:10,495
Coming up,
 in Long Beach, California...

174
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:12,063
Outstanding.

175
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:15,600
...a neighborhood spot getting
 outrageous with octopi...

176
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:17,369
Look at that, huh?
     That is it.

177
00:07:17,371 --> 00:07:19,070
...and dangerous
  with the whole hog.

178
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:19,871
He's off the tail.

179
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:29,581
So, I'm here
 in my old stomping grounds,

180
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:32,317
Belmont Shore
 in Long Beach, California.

181
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,685
Matter of fact,

182
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:35,320
I used to live on that street
  right there, Nieto.

183
00:07:35,322 --> 00:07:37,122
Now, listen, a lot has evolved
 since I lived down here.

184
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:38,457
Tons of new restaurants

185
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:40,792
with lots of character
  like this joint.

186
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:41,993
This is tavern on 2.

187
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:47,199
Tavern on 2 burger.

188
00:07:47,201 --> 00:07:49,334
It's a great local spot,
   a hidden gem.

189
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:50,469
Pick up, let's go!

190
00:07:50,471 --> 00:07:53,271
Surprisingly upscale,
  gastro pubby food.

191
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:54,406
Can't be beat.

192
00:07:54,408 --> 00:07:56,107
The gastro pub menu

193
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:58,543
is exactly what this hood
   was missing

194
00:07:58,545 --> 00:08:01,012
when owner Brian Clark
   opened in 2011.

195
00:08:02,049 --> 00:08:03,515
We were actually
    the first guy

196
00:08:03,517 --> 00:08:05,083
to do what
   we're doing down here.

197
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:06,251
It was pretty sparse.

198
00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:07,986
It was Super Mex, still one
of my favorite joints.

199
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:10,155
But there was no joint
 like tavern on 2.
       Right.

200
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:11,990
Throw in Chef Frank DeLoach,

201
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:13,725
who left behind fine dining

202
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:16,728
to show off his culinary skills,
   and ink, here.

203
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:19,030
Let me get
   some inventory here.

204
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:20,999
Very nice.
     Ah, sick.

205
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:23,268
What type of food
   do you guys do here?

206
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,302
Generally,
we try to take a lot

207
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:25,437
of influence
from the neighborhoods.

208
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:27,272
So, we have a lot
 of Asian influence,

209
00:08:27,274 --> 00:08:29,040
Mexican influence,
 stuff like that.

210
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:31,109
Dig it.

211
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:32,677
Like this twist
  on surf and turf.

212
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,179
Belly and sucker.

213
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:36,615
You've got octopus,
 and you've got pork belly.

214
00:08:36,617 --> 00:08:38,049
I mean, you can't go wrong.

215
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:40,585
Flavor that is just so unique
  and so incredible.

216
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:42,821
What are we getting into?

217
00:08:42,823 --> 00:08:44,389
We're gonna start off
 with our pork belly

218
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:45,590
for our belly
 and sucker dish.

219
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:47,025
Excellent.

220
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:50,128
So, salt and sugar,
 top and bottom.

221
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,330
And we're gonna let this brine
    for how long?

222
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:54,032
Typically,
we do this overnight.

223
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,734
Okay.
    Beer and water.

224
00:08:55,736 --> 00:08:59,604
Braise it at 300 degrees
until nice and tender.

225
00:08:59,606 --> 00:09:01,239
Next up.
 Octopus.

226
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:03,708
Yes. Look at this.

227
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,110
We're gonna go
  in the pot.

228
00:09:05,112 --> 00:09:07,445
We're gonna braise it
with a little bit of water,

229
00:09:07,447 --> 00:09:09,981
red wine vinegar,
  some salt,

230
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:13,685
black peppercorns, bay leafs,
 whole garlic.

231
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:14,953
And how long
  are we gonna let this go?

232
00:09:14,955 --> 00:09:16,454
For about four hours.

233
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:17,656
Low and slow?
Low and slow.

234
00:09:17,658 --> 00:09:19,424
Bring it out, let it cool.

235
00:09:19,426 --> 00:09:21,560
Overnight,
 in its own liquid.

236
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:22,727
Okay, Chef, we ready?
Ready.

237
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:28,199
So now the belly's out,
we're gonna press it.

238
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:31,636
There we go.

239
00:09:31,638 --> 00:09:34,072
And we're gonna take
our other sheet tray,

240
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,273
lay it right on top,

241
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:35,740
and we add a little bit
  of weight.

242
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,108
goa weigh it?
lay it right on top,

243
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,411
Try to get a nice, uniform
texture so we slice it later.

244
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:40,779
You don't have
    all these gaps.

245
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:41,913
Then we're
 gonna go overnight.

246
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,415
Got it.

247
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:44,549
What goes
    on the top of this?

248
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:46,351
A black currant
 vinaigrette.

249
00:09:46,353 --> 00:09:47,686
Ooh, that sounds nice.

250
00:09:47,688 --> 00:09:50,055
So, we have just
some dried black currants,

251
00:09:50,057 --> 00:09:51,890
diced shallots,

252
00:09:51,892 --> 00:09:53,491
season everything up
with a nice pinch of salt,

253
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:55,293
then we add
our red wine vinegar,

254
00:09:55,295 --> 00:09:56,561
equal parts to burgundy.

255
00:09:56,563 --> 00:09:58,730
Quite a few grounds
 of black pepper.

256
00:09:58,732 --> 00:10:00,532
About a full
 two tablespoons.

257
00:10:00,534 --> 00:10:03,602
We're gonna let this go until
all the currants are plump,

258
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:07,305
so about four to five minutes
on full, rapid boil.

259
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:09,007
Then it's ready to roll.
      Excellent.

260
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:11,843
So we have our octopus.
    Beautiful, okay.

261
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:14,412
It's so tender,
we can just pull it apart.
      I like it.

262
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:16,448
This is the pork belly
we've been pressing overnight.

263
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:19,684
Portion it into about
the width we want first.

264
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:21,219
And just slice it up.

265
00:10:21,221 --> 00:10:22,621
Beautiful.

266
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:24,356
Cold pan,
'cause we want to try

267
00:10:24,358 --> 00:10:26,458
to really get it as crispy
 as possible.

268
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,260
Let it come up to temp,
 let it start to slowly render

269
00:10:29,262 --> 00:10:31,596
by the time it starts
   to cook off the fat.

270
00:10:31,598 --> 00:10:32,797
GBD -- golden, brown,
 and delicious.

271
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:33,999
Okay, so we let that go.

272
00:10:34,001 --> 00:10:35,934
What are we gonna do
    with the octopus?

273
00:10:35,936 --> 00:10:37,202
We're actually gonna crisp
the octopus in a different way.

274
00:10:37,204 --> 00:10:38,436
We're gonna fry it.

275
00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:41,072
Refrying it just gets the best
 texture all around.

276
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:43,008
Nice little crunch
    on the outside.

277
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:45,010
Warm through the middle?
Absolutely.

278
00:10:45,012 --> 00:10:47,145
We're now gonna take
 carrot caramel.

279
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:48,213
With brown sugar?

280
00:10:48,215 --> 00:10:49,881
Just carrot.

281
00:10:49,883 --> 00:10:51,549
Just a carrot reduction?

282
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:54,019
That's it.
Lay this guy in a bowl.

283
00:10:54,021 --> 00:10:56,287
It's got nice GBD?

284
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:57,722
Yes, it does have nice GBD.

285
00:11:00,894 --> 00:11:02,193
We then have
our very crispy octopus.

286
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:03,461
Yes, we do.

287
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:04,696
We're gonna go real crazy
  with it.

288
00:11:04,698 --> 00:11:06,097
Look at that, huh?
That's half the fun.

289
00:11:06,099 --> 00:11:09,834
That is it.
Red radishes, jicama.

290
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,102
A little bitterness,
    a little crunch.

291
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:13,571
A little bit
 of the vinaigrette,

292
00:11:13,573 --> 00:11:15,206
some of those currants,

293
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:20,245
dill, fennel, cilantro,
chervil, nasturtium.

294
00:11:20,247 --> 00:11:22,147
Wait, I'm sorry,
    back up the one.

295
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:23,481
Nasturtium.
     Nasturium?

296
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:24,849
As the flower.

297
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:27,786
You know, I just ran out
 of nasturtium earlier today.

298
00:11:29,423 --> 00:11:33,658
All right, the belly is
   ridiculous, fall apart.

299
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,796
It is so unctuous.

300
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:39,464
It's pretty rich.
       Oh!

301
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:42,233
I am a humongous
    octopus fan.

302
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:48,139
And this is simple,

303
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:51,776
but incredibly flavorful
    and refined.

304
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:55,113
You know what the real kicker
     of it is?

305
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:59,050
Is the freshness of the veg,
     the herbs,

306
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,119
the brightness
    that those bring.

307
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:06,157
Shut the front door.

308
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:07,792
Shut the front
    and the back door.

309
00:12:07,794 --> 00:12:08,860
It's that good.

310
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:10,695
Dude,
   you have mad skills.

311
00:12:10,697 --> 00:12:12,464
Thank you.
     Outstanding.

312
00:12:12,466 --> 00:12:15,500
The tenderness of the octopus
 combined with the pork belly

313
00:12:15,502 --> 00:12:17,769
is just like nothing else.

314
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:21,306
There's a lot of interesting
  food items on the menu

315
00:12:21,308 --> 00:12:23,408
that I've never had before.

316
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,610
It's not like any place else.

317
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:27,145
I just feel that there is
    something else

318
00:12:27,147 --> 00:12:28,446
that you have
   that I've got to try.

319
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:29,280
Pig tails.

320
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:31,483
Oh!
    Don't go anywhere.

321
00:12:31,485 --> 00:12:33,485
"Triple D" is hanging out
  at Belmont Shores

322
00:12:33,487 --> 00:12:34,853
in Long Beach, California.

323
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:37,021
When we come back, the wild man
  brings the pig tails.

324
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:37,756
See you in a bit.

325
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:45,964
Welcome back.
   We're at tavern on 2,

326
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:47,799
the Belmont Shore,
   Long Beach, California,

327
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:50,101
my old stomping grounds,

328
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:53,438
and we have had the belly
  and sucker, outrageous.

329
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,509
And now, after all of this,
 you're gonna give me pig tails.

330
00:12:57,511 --> 00:12:59,310
Pig tails.

331
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:00,912
It's like
 pork chicken wings.

332
00:13:00,914 --> 00:13:02,313
Pork chicken wings.
     Okay.

333
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:04,983
They look kind of strange.

334
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:06,284
Yes, they do.

335
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:07,986
I was kind of expecting
    to be a little --

336
00:13:07,988 --> 00:13:09,721
Everyone does.

337
00:13:09,723 --> 00:13:11,656
So we're not even gonna touch
 those or mess around with them.

338
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:12,724
We're just gonna put 'em
    right in there.

339
00:13:12,726 --> 00:13:13,424
Everybody in the pool.

340
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:15,527
Salt, sugar.
       Okay.

341
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:18,229
Coriander, black pepper,
  red onions.

342
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:19,497
Dig it.

343
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:20,832
Cilantro stems,
  just a few.

344
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:22,600
Got it, only need
   two or six handfuls.

345
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:23,668
Ginger.

346
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:24,335
And Mary Ann.

347
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:26,070
Little bit of water.

348
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:27,238
Rice wine vinegar.

349
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:31,709
We're gonna let these simmer
for about three hours,

350
00:13:31,711 --> 00:13:35,113
lay 'em onto a sheet tray,
and let 'em cool overnight.

351
00:13:35,115 --> 00:13:38,149
They congealed inside of
 their own braising liquid now.

352
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,517
We're gonna take 'em off
 and portion 'em.

353
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,186
And so --

354
00:13:41,188 --> 00:13:43,288
They're that soft, you can just
   pop right through 'em.

355
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,823
Now we're gonna
 deep fry 'em.

356
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:47,091
We're gonna let them go
for about four minutes.

357
00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:48,092
Got it.

358
00:13:48,094 --> 00:13:49,227
Until GBD.

359
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:50,228
Until they're GBD.

360
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:52,864
While the tails
    are bopping --

361
00:13:52,866 --> 00:13:54,566
We're gonna add the sauce.
       Got it.

362
00:13:54,568 --> 00:13:58,169
Hoisin, oyster sauce,
  sambo,

363
00:13:58,171 --> 00:13:59,437
black bean sauce, o.j.,
  lime juice,

364
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:01,406
water, sriracha,
 brown sugar.

365
00:14:01,408 --> 00:14:02,674
Very nice.

366
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:04,475
A few of
 my favorite things.
      I enjoy.

367
00:14:04,477 --> 00:14:07,946
So we got our nice
 crispy fried tails.

368
00:14:07,948 --> 00:14:10,315
We're gonna get 'em
  in a sauce.

369
00:14:10,317 --> 00:14:13,318
This is where it becomes
 sticky pig tails.

370
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,520
Sticky pig tails.

371
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:17,889
Everything's better
 when it's sticky.

372
00:14:17,891 --> 00:14:20,625
Back on a vinyl car seat,
    not so much.

373
00:14:20,627 --> 00:14:24,629
Roasted sesame seeds,
  scallions.

374
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,266
So, nice,
 sticky pig tails.

375
00:14:28,268 --> 00:14:30,535
Almost like Chinese
 takeout style.

376
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:32,237
I like it.
    It's a big wing.

377
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:33,938
It's exactly what it is.

378
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:38,142
Some micro cilantro, a little
more sesame raw, and scallions.

379
00:14:45,652 --> 00:14:48,186
It's like a pork rib
  that really had a chance

380
00:14:48,188 --> 00:14:50,121
to cook down a little bit.

381
00:14:50,123 --> 00:14:51,823
Great texture to it...

382
00:14:51,825 --> 00:14:53,691
nice meatiness.

383
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:58,763
And when you offer things as
 eclectic as pig tails fried up,

384
00:14:58,765 --> 00:15:02,901
toss in an awesome
   spicy Asian sauce...

385
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:04,535
I don't know what to say.

386
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:05,737
You rock, man.

387
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:06,871
Thank you, sir.
      Go get 'em.

388
00:15:06,873 --> 00:15:10,108
Pig tails, pick up!

389
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:12,911
The pig tails blow
 chicken wings out of the water.

390
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:14,212
The sweet and savory sauce

391
00:15:14,214 --> 00:15:16,080
that's on there
  is just incredible,

392
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:17,515
and the meat, it's so tender.

393
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:18,650
They're sticky,

394
00:15:18,652 --> 00:15:20,418
and you need
 a wet nap when you're done.

395
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,586
They're wonderful.

396
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:22,620
Have you ever had
    a pig tail before?

397
00:15:22,622 --> 00:15:23,788
Not before here.

398
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:24,856
I mean,
the flavor is banging.

399
00:15:24,858 --> 00:15:26,024
I love tavern on 2.

400
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:28,159
It's casual.
 People are really friendly.

401
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:30,028
The food is sensational.

402
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,529
Food's off the hook.

403
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:33,031
Dude's off the tail.

404
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:34,299
Hey!
       Hey!

405
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,369
Up next...

406
00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:40,338
You make your rubs.
You make your sauces.

407
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,673
...in Monterey, California...

408
00:15:41,675 --> 00:15:42,941
You make your bread,
you make your muffin.

409
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:46,344
...the local joint running
 a scratch-made marathon.

410
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:47,612
You make your --
      Everything.

411
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:48,646
Except the ketchup
 and mustard.

412
00:15:55,722 --> 00:15:58,623
So, I'm here in the old town
 of Monterey, California,

413
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,625
to check out a joint.
   Now, get this.

414
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:03,027
They have people growing
  their produce for 'em.

415
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:04,996
They're baking
  just about everything.

416
00:16:04,998 --> 00:16:08,132
They're into sustainability
  and total organics,

417
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:09,467
and get this.

418
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,903
They scratch make everything

419
00:16:11,905 --> 00:16:13,204
except the ketchup and mustard.

420
00:16:13,206 --> 00:16:14,172
This is the Wild Plum.

421
00:16:19,746 --> 00:16:22,046
Some of the best food
 on the Monterey peninsula.

422
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:23,748
Basil burger, table six.

423
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,050
Best of a farmer's market
   on a plate.

424
00:16:26,052 --> 00:16:29,220
This is a salad bowl
  of the whole country,

425
00:16:29,222 --> 00:16:31,723
and Pamela is so good
  about making sure

426
00:16:31,725 --> 00:16:34,192
she incorporates
  local fresh vegetables.

427
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:37,362
A code Chef Pamela Burns
 has pretty much lived by

428
00:16:37,364 --> 00:16:39,831
since she opened this place
   back in '99.

429
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:42,200
She's like the hippie auntie
  I always wanted.

430
00:16:42,202 --> 00:16:45,803
I don't even want to
  call it homemade

431
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:48,506
because I could never make
 anything like this at home.

432
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,808
Pickup, please, porchetta!

433
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,944
I mean, it's pork and bacon.
  Where can you go wrong?

434
00:16:52,946 --> 00:16:54,545
And the way the flavors
  bounce in your mouth,

435
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:55,313
it's just phenomenal.

436
00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:01,085
Porchetta -- I don't see
the big belly and the --

437
00:17:01,087 --> 00:17:02,286
I'm not doing it that way.

438
00:17:02,288 --> 00:17:05,189
I'm doing a version
    of porchetta.

439
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:06,290
Oh, hello.

440
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:07,291
Is that all right?

441
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:08,626
Oh, yeah,
this is your house, girl.

442
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:10,294
You have the knife, also.
    That's right.

443
00:17:10,296 --> 00:17:13,398
I make a pork filling
  with roasted pork shoulder.

444
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,869
So we're gonna cut this down,
    keeping this up.

445
00:17:19,506 --> 00:17:22,974
Season with salt and pepper,
  extra virgin olive oil.

446
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:27,078
And we're gonna go
    with our bacon fat,

447
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:31,616
brown sugar,
    onions, fennel.

448
00:17:31,618 --> 00:17:33,885
Whole garlic,
    chopped oregano.

449
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:35,153
Roast it for an hour.

450
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:39,657
And then we add apples
     to it,

451
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:42,727
and then another
  hour and a half, two hours.

452
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:45,830
Now we work
 with the pork loin.

453
00:17:45,832 --> 00:17:49,000
I'm gonna butterfly this.

454
00:17:49,002 --> 00:17:50,401
So I'm gonna go like this.

455
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:52,036
Getting medieval on it,
  aren't you?

456
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:53,504
I'm gonna stuff it
    with some garlic.

457
00:17:53,506 --> 00:17:54,539
I'll slice, you put.

458
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:57,241
All right, perfect.

459
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:58,543
Okay, now we're in there.

460
00:17:58,545 --> 00:18:01,546
Salt, pepper, olive oil --

461
00:18:01,548 --> 00:18:03,347
just a smidge.

462
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:04,782
Rub that in there.

463
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:06,651
A little blend of oregano
     and thyme.

464
00:18:06,653 --> 00:18:09,187
And then we do the same thing
    to the other side.

465
00:18:09,189 --> 00:18:11,923
Now I'm gonna give this
 a little shot of brown sugar.

466
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:14,025
On both sides.

467
00:18:14,027 --> 00:18:15,426
Okay?
  Now we're ready to roll.

468
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:16,494
Pork filling,

469
00:18:16,496 --> 00:18:18,830
and we're gonna do
    a pinwheel roll.

470
00:18:18,832 --> 00:18:20,031
Okay, so here we go.

471
00:18:20,033 --> 00:18:22,066
Give it a good roll
     like that.

472
00:18:22,068 --> 00:18:24,001
I tie this so that it will
    stay together,

473
00:18:24,003 --> 00:18:28,005
and then I do the bacon
   just like this on top.

474
00:18:28,007 --> 00:18:29,740
You lay the bacon on top?

475
00:18:29,742 --> 00:18:30,842
I lay the bacon on top.

476
00:18:30,844 --> 00:18:31,876
You tie it off,
and then you tie it again?

477
00:18:31,878 --> 00:18:32,543
I tie it again.

478
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:34,779
Now it's ready to roast.

479
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:37,949
At approximately 350
   for about 40 minutes.

480
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:40,651
And I cook it
    a little bit rare

481
00:18:40,653 --> 00:18:43,354
'cause I'm gonna sear it
    on one side.

482
00:18:43,356 --> 00:18:45,123
Because I just don't want
   the pork to be dry.

483
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,357
Nothing worse.

484
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:48,092
Let me just
pick that off there.

485
00:18:48,094 --> 00:18:50,495
Sure.

486
00:18:50,497 --> 00:18:51,729
That came out
    pretty perfect.

487
00:18:51,731 --> 00:18:52,630
Gorgeous.
      Yeah.

488
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,832
A little bit of olive oil.

489
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:58,436
Let that sit
   for like one minute.

490
00:18:58,438 --> 00:18:59,370
Now flip it.

491
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:05,042
Put in my apples
    and my pears.

492
00:19:05,044 --> 00:19:06,344
Just a pinch of salt,

493
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:07,912
and I'm just gonna pour
  a little bit of this juice

494
00:19:07,914 --> 00:19:10,248
the've strained off
  the roasted pork filling,

495
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:14,886
and then I finish it in the oven
 for like four or five minutes.

496
00:19:14,888 --> 00:19:15,987
We ready?
       Yep!

497
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:18,523
Pan-fried potatoes.
A whole bunch of 'em.

498
00:19:18,525 --> 00:19:22,260
And then I'm gonna
    put in the pork.

499
00:19:22,262 --> 00:19:24,362
A little bit
    of the good stuff.

500
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:26,831
Here at
the delicate Wild Plum,

501
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,600
don't think you're not getting
a chuck wagon portion.

502
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:31,903
All right.

503
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:37,775
What I love
 about porchetta

504
00:19:37,777 --> 00:19:39,577
is that you get all the
different parts of the pig.

505
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:43,648
You get the salty,
crunchy bacon side of it.

506
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,883
Here, you've incorporated
 the shoulder,

507
00:19:45,885 --> 00:19:47,051
which has tremendous flavor,

508
00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:48,753
and wrapping the bacon
 around the outside.

509
00:19:48,755 --> 00:19:50,087
The loin gets
 all that flavor,

510
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:51,589
more flavor in the loin
 than it has.

511
00:19:51,591 --> 00:19:52,857
Right.

512
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:54,292
Adding the pear
 and the apple,

513
00:19:54,294 --> 00:19:56,127
it's just such an elevated
 flavor profile,

514
00:19:56,129 --> 00:19:57,528
and it gives it
 such balance.

515
00:19:58,765 --> 00:19:59,597
Really neat.
     Oh, thank you.

516
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:00,264
Good job.

517
00:20:02,835 --> 00:20:05,903
Wow, this is just like
 this huge piece of bacon.

518
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:08,439
Just smoky and sweet.

519
00:20:08,441 --> 00:20:09,440
It is just absolutely wonderful.

520
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:10,908
Really well cooked.

521
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,310
Worth seeking out.

522
00:20:12,312 --> 00:20:14,312
Everything that she puts
   her hand to

523
00:20:14,314 --> 00:20:16,614
is always just
  very, very special.

524
00:20:16,616 --> 00:20:18,449
Sage sausage skillet.

525
00:20:18,451 --> 00:20:20,351
I love her baked goods.

526
00:20:20,353 --> 00:20:23,788
Whether it's her muffins,
  her scones, her pies.

527
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,356
You make your batters,
 you make your rubs,

528
00:20:25,358 --> 00:20:26,924
you make your sausage,
you make your bread,

529
00:20:26,926 --> 00:20:27,758
you make your muffins.

530
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,560
That's right.
     Everything.

531
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:30,962
Except the ketchup
 and mustard.

532
00:20:30,964 --> 00:20:32,563
Nice job.
      Thank you.

533
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:35,833
So, that's it for this
 road trip, but don't worry.

534
00:20:35,835 --> 00:20:39,170
We got plenty more joints
 to find all over this country!

535
00:20:39,172 --> 00:20:41,339
I'll be looking for you
   next time

536
00:20:41,341 --> 00:20:43,574
on "Diners, Drive-ins,
   and Dives."

537
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:45,576
What is this?
Belly and sucker.

538
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,979
Belly and sucker.
   We're belly and sucker.

539
00:20:47,981 --> 00:20:49,614
Which one am I?

540
00:20:49,616 --> 00:20:50,881
You're definitely belly.

541
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:51,816
Damn!

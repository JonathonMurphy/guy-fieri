1
00:00:04,739 --> 00:00:06,538
I'm Guy Fieri
  and we're rollin' out

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:07,973
on a special edition

3
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:11,243
of "Diners, Drive-ins
  and Dives" in Cuba.

4
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,315
I know you're going,
"Are you serious? He's in Cuba?"

5
00:00:16,317 --> 00:00:19,018
Yep. We're on the island
  of mojitos and music...

6
00:00:20,621 --> 00:00:22,955
...cigars and classic cars.

7
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,261
And of course, as we cruise
 across the capital city,

8
00:00:29,263 --> 00:00:31,663
we're diving
 into the rich Cuban cuisine

9
00:00:31,665 --> 00:00:34,099
in this exploding food scene.

10
00:00:34,101 --> 00:00:35,434
It's so good.

11
00:00:35,436 --> 00:00:37,369
I'm not talkin' "kind of good."

12
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:40,072
Whether it's outdoor grilling
  on a Paladar patio...

13
00:00:40,074 --> 00:00:41,273
Very talented.

14
00:00:41,275 --> 00:00:44,209
...legendary recipes
 from a celebrated chef...

15
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:45,411
I've had lobster a lot of ways.

16
00:00:45,413 --> 00:00:47,379
I've never had lobster
  with coffee sauce.

17
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:49,515
...or even real-deal
  Soviet specialties...

18
00:00:49,517 --> 00:00:51,617
Ah ha ha,
  this looks good.

19
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:54,553
...it's a cultural experience
  not to be forgotten.

20
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:57,890
Because this is authentic.
  So get ready to dig in,

21
00:00:57,892 --> 00:01:00,893
absorb the view,
  and enjoy the ride.

22
00:01:00,895 --> 00:01:03,662
Outrageous.

23
00:01:03,664 --> 00:01:05,697
That's all right here,
   right now,

24
00:01:05,699 --> 00:01:08,200
on "Triple D"
  in Havana, Cuba.

25
00:01:31,158 --> 00:01:34,059
Never in a million years
  would you tell me

26
00:01:34,061 --> 00:01:36,028
that I'm gonna make it to Cuba.

27
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,163
Here I am, "Diners,
  Drive-ins and Dives,"

28
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:39,465
in Havana, Cuba.

29
00:01:39,467 --> 00:01:41,066
And I gotta tell you something,
   I'm blown away.

30
00:01:41,068 --> 00:01:42,701
I've wanted to come here
  since I was a kid,

31
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:44,336
'cause of the culture,
   the food,

32
00:01:44,338 --> 00:01:47,372
my appreciation for rum,
   great cigars.

33
00:01:47,374 --> 00:01:49,374
So I'm in an area
  known as Old Havana

34
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:50,976
in Barbers' Alley.

35
00:01:50,978 --> 00:01:52,478
You ask anybody
 where Barbers' Alley is,

36
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,545
they'll be able to tell ya.

37
00:01:53,547 --> 00:01:54,947
But I'm here
  to check out a joint

38
00:01:54,949 --> 00:01:56,648
that's got such a crazy story.

39
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,450
It's a tribute to a chef.

40
00:01:58,452 --> 00:01:59,551
And I can give you
  all the details.

41
00:01:59,553 --> 00:02:01,086
But you have to hear it
   to believe it.

42
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,721
This is El Figaro.

43
00:02:03,757 --> 00:02:06,125
El Figaro -- off the chain.

44
00:02:06,127 --> 00:02:08,260
Just knocked it
right outta the ballpark.

45
00:02:08,262 --> 00:02:10,462
Traditional Cuban food...

46
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,466
And based on
  a lot of history,

47
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:17,903
something veteran employee
 Joan Blanco is proud of.

48
00:02:17,905 --> 00:02:20,539
This restaurant is a museum
  for the life of what's

49
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:23,675
one of the most important chefs
  in the Cuban history.

50
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:26,278
His name was
 Gilberto Smith Duquesne.

51
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,349
He was the personal chef
  of many important people.

52
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:32,484
Like Frank Sinatra,
   Nat King Cole,

53
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:35,120
Ernest Hemingway
  and Brigitte Bardot.

54
00:02:35,122 --> 00:02:36,889
All the food
    that we offer here

55
00:02:36,891 --> 00:02:38,824
is the food
   that Gilberto cooked.

56
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:41,560
With Chef Alex Luco
  carrying the torch,

57
00:02:41,562 --> 00:02:45,297
making a splash with
 this unique Gilberto specialty.

58
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:46,832
The lobster in coffee sauce.

59
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:50,269
Lobster in coffee sauce,
   it's fantastic.

60
00:02:50,271 --> 00:02:53,872
You need to know the tale
   of the recipe.

61
00:02:53,874 --> 00:02:56,141
It goes back
 to when Gilberto was cooking

62
00:02:56,143 --> 00:02:58,644
for French President
  Francois Mitterrand.

63
00:02:58,646 --> 00:03:00,412
So Gilberto take a lot
    of coffee.

64
00:03:00,414 --> 00:03:04,116
He was in the kitchen,
  cooked his famous lobster,

65
00:03:04,118 --> 00:03:06,652
and the espresso dropped.

66
00:03:06,654 --> 00:03:08,720
How you say
  to the president, "Sorry.

67
00:03:08,722 --> 00:03:10,656
The food is bad now,"
     you know?
   Mm-hmm.

68
00:03:10,658 --> 00:03:13,425
As a good chef, he made it.
   He fixed it.

69
00:03:13,427 --> 00:03:15,727
And when Mitterrand
   tried that, he said,

70
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:18,197
"Wow, I need more like that."

71
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:19,398
All right, Chef.

72
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,033
Beautiful lobster, look at that.

73
00:03:21,035 --> 00:03:22,668
- And it's fresh.
   -Never frozen.

74
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,703
When you do that,
   you kill the flavor.

75
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:26,371
Do you have freezers in Cuba?

76
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:27,873
Yeah.
   Not many.

77
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,341
I don't know.
    Okay.

78
00:03:29,343 --> 00:03:30,876
I don't work
     in that sector.

79
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:33,145
"I don't work in that sector."

80
00:03:33,147 --> 00:03:34,680
I'd take this guy anywhere.

81
00:03:34,682 --> 00:03:36,148
Okay.
    Salt and pepper.

82
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,283
Not very much pepper.
    It's white pepper.

83
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:40,652
Uh, exactly.

84
00:03:40,654 --> 00:03:44,990
Lime juice, we put olive oil,
   the lobster.

85
00:03:44,992 --> 00:03:46,191
So just a little bit
   of temperature.

86
00:03:46,193 --> 00:03:47,526
Yeah.
  So it's not tough.

87
00:03:47,528 --> 00:03:50,195
The lobster, they will tell
  you when it's ready...

88
00:03:54,368 --> 00:03:55,567
You're crazy.

89
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,069
The onions, butter...

90
00:03:57,071 --> 00:03:58,904
Got it.
     Seven-year rum.

91
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,941
Very dangerous
   with my hair.

92
00:04:02,943 --> 00:04:04,109
A little demi-glace.
       Yeah.

93
00:04:04,111 --> 00:04:05,377
Now, the<i> vino blanco.</i>

94
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:06,912
<i> Capitan...</i>

95
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:10,249
Okay.
   <i> Sí, sí, sí.</i>

96
00:04:10,251 --> 00:04:11,250
Champignon.

97
00:04:11,252 --> 00:04:12,451
Mushrooms...
       Yeah.

98
00:04:12,453 --> 00:04:14,219
Parmesan?
     A little bit.

99
00:04:14,221 --> 00:04:16,555
Building the layers.
       Yeah.

100
00:04:16,557 --> 00:04:17,589
The hot sauce...
    Okay.

101
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:19,491
A little coffee.
       Coffee.

102
00:04:19,493 --> 00:04:21,994
Kahlúa? For the lobster
   or<i> para tú?</i>

103
00:04:21,996 --> 00:04:23,895
- No.
   -Oh. All right.

104
00:04:23,897 --> 00:04:25,163
And<i> crema...</i>

105
00:04:25,165 --> 00:04:26,965
Is the last part.

106
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:28,533
Oh, we're gonna stuff it back
   in the shell.

107
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:30,335
Beautiful, and what is this?

108
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:32,804
<i> Albahaca.</i>
Oh, basil.

109
00:04:32,806 --> 00:04:34,306
Bon appétit.

110
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,210
That's a delicious dish.

111
00:04:38,212 --> 00:04:39,878
I thought the coffee
 was gonna be too strong,

112
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,446
where you weren't gonna
  get the lobster.

113
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:42,848
But not.
  Very delicate.

114
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,783
Yeah.
 It's not really strong seafood.

115
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:47,019
It's not just strong coffee.

116
00:04:47,021 --> 00:04:50,022
It's a really good balance.

117
00:04:50,024 --> 00:04:52,591
Excellent.
 I know that Cubans love coffee.

118
00:04:52,593 --> 00:04:54,526
Putting it into a lobster tail,
   I didn't know.

119
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:55,994
Outstanding.

120
00:04:55,996 --> 00:04:58,530
- Your lobster, sir.
 -It's the best. The best.

121
00:04:58,532 --> 00:05:00,866
Presentation was excellent.

122
00:05:00,868 --> 00:05:03,302
So you know that I would not
 come to Havana, Cuba,

123
00:05:03,304 --> 00:05:04,569
without bringin' my family.

124
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:06,772
So my mom and dad
and of course my wife, Lori.

125
00:05:06,774 --> 00:05:08,407
I've never had anything
   like this.

126
00:05:08,409 --> 00:05:10,342
I mean, I love coffee.
   I love lobster,

127
00:05:10,344 --> 00:05:12,010
but who ever thought
 of putting them together?

128
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:13,545
It's absolutely delicious.

129
00:05:13,547 --> 00:05:15,047
I don't know how they've been
 married together so well.

130
00:05:15,049 --> 00:05:17,149
- Bon appétit.
  -<i> Merci.</i>

131
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:20,519
It's very good,
 uh, food and good people.

132
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:22,521
Starting
  with Gilberto Reina,

133
00:05:22,523 --> 00:05:24,356
known around here as Papito,

134
00:05:24,358 --> 00:05:25,757
who owns the barber shop

135
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,060
that's anchored
  this alley for years.

136
00:05:28,062 --> 00:05:31,063
There are a lot of little shops
  with different arts.

137
00:05:31,065 --> 00:05:35,067
It just seems to be a street
  full of togetherness,

138
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:36,568
so it gotta have good food.

139
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:39,671
What else are we gonna make?
  Pork in Camagueyana style.

140
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,940
Camaguey is the province.
      Pork, sir.

141
00:05:41,942 --> 00:05:44,242
Pork loin,<i> magnifique.</i>

142
00:05:44,244 --> 00:05:47,579
Oh, wrong language.
<i> Magnifico.</i>

143
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:49,348
<i> Lomo...</i>
<i> Lomo...</i>

144
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,183
<i> ...de cerdo...</i>
<i> ...de cerdo...</i>

145
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:52,617
<i> ...a la...</i>
<i> ...a la...</i>

146
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:54,619
<i> ...Camagueyana.</i>
<i> ...Camagueyana.</i>

147
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:56,288
Huh?

148
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,357
Nope, you're not tuning
 in to the Spanish channel.

149
00:05:58,359 --> 00:05:59,891
This is still "Triple D."

150
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:01,293
See you in a bit.

151
00:06:11,572 --> 00:06:14,106
Welcome back.
 "Triple D" hanging out in Cuba.

152
00:06:14,108 --> 00:06:15,540
I know you're going,
  "Are you serious?

153
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:17,809
He's in Cuba?
   Outrageous."

154
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:20,979
Now, we're here in Old Havana
 in a joint called El Figaro.

155
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:22,781
Now, this restaurant

156
00:06:22,783 --> 00:06:26,218
is all based upon a chef
  that has cooked for...

157
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,586
Everybody.

158
00:06:27,588 --> 00:06:30,589
That chef to the stars
 was Gilberto Smith Duquesne,

159
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:32,491
and here, they're all about
   cookin' up

160
00:06:32,493 --> 00:06:34,559
his legendary recipes.

161
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:37,396
I'm from New York.
I'm used to eating good food.

162
00:06:37,398 --> 00:06:39,531
This was truly spectacular.

163
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:43,702
The pork -- the pork loin
   Camagueyana style.

164
00:06:43,704 --> 00:06:47,372
Thin-cut pieces
of meat, sauteed peppers,

165
00:06:47,374 --> 00:06:49,508
onions with a light sauce...

166
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,476
It's very good.

167
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:53,512
Camaguey is the area
  in the center of Cuba,

168
00:06:53,514 --> 00:06:55,514
so this is a dish
  from that region.

169
00:06:55,516 --> 00:06:57,849
Yeah.
 Okay. Beautiful red color
   on the pork.

170
00:06:57,851 --> 00:06:59,384
So we put salt.
    Okay.

171
00:06:59,386 --> 00:07:01,019
Pureed garlic.
   Some<i> ajo.</i>

172
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:03,655
Lime...
  Marinate it a little bit.

173
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:05,323
Ay! There we go.

174
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:06,792
White wine.
    Okay.

175
00:07:06,794 --> 00:07:08,627
And then, the --
    Rosemary, parsley.

176
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:11,329
Rosemary and parsley.
      Demi-glace.

177
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:13,265
And now, we will prepare...
   The sauce.

178
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:14,800
Yeah. Pepper.
    Got it.

179
00:07:14,802 --> 00:07:16,501
The onions, white wine,

180
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:19,070
and a spoon of demi-glace.
    Next?

181
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:23,041
The final touch is a couple
  of minutes cooked together.

182
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:24,643
Beautiful.

183
00:07:24,645 --> 00:07:26,111
<i> Tranquilo.</i>

184
00:07:27,147 --> 00:07:28,947
Namaste.

185
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:31,516
Okay.
    That's pesto sauce.
   Pesto sauce.

186
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:38,190
People wanna ask
 how to make great flavor.

187
00:07:38,192 --> 00:07:39,858
You gotta start
 with fantastic products.

188
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,394
In Cuba, it's all organic.
     All organic.

189
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:46,932
Very simple dish,

190
00:07:46,934 --> 00:07:50,969
but in its flavor profile,
   dynamite.

191
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:54,306
The peppers really have
 a fantastic depth of flavor.

192
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:57,242
The texture of the pork,
   the tenderness.

193
00:08:00,414 --> 00:08:03,482
That kinda time and attention,
 featuring the local products,

194
00:08:03,484 --> 00:08:05,951
handmade by a young chef
  like this, outstanding.

195
00:08:05,953 --> 00:08:07,519
If I could get that
   in a cubano...

196
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:09,054
We prefer a sandwich with that.

197
00:08:09,056 --> 00:08:10,322
Do you?
       Yeah.

198
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:11,723
Figaro.

199
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:13,492
Fantastic, man.

200
00:08:13,494 --> 00:08:15,360
The chef had it on the money.
  It was perfect.

201
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:18,096
Dad, you've had more pork
than we should talk about.

202
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:19,631
What do you think?
    It's -- it's great.

203
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:21,766
I haven't had pork
   like this, very tender.

204
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:23,802
So you know that if it's passed
  my family's test,

205
00:08:23,804 --> 00:08:25,937
this is the joint you gotta
 check out -- El Figaro.

206
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:27,372
We're definitely
  gonna come back,

207
00:08:27,374 --> 00:08:30,509
and I'm gonna tell
  everybody I know.

208
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:32,911
Okay. One more lobster.

209
00:08:32,913 --> 00:08:35,280
<i> Otra langosta.</i>
No. I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

210
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:39,985
Comin' up, we're headed
  to a room with a view

211
00:08:39,987 --> 00:08:42,053
on the island's main drag...

212
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:43,688
Unbelievable, man.

213
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,424
...where they're dishin' out
 righteous Russian favorites...

214
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:49,828
Tell me that's not ridiculous.

215
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,563
...hittin' the culinary jackpot.

216
00:08:51,565 --> 00:08:52,931
Oh-ho! Yahtzee!

217
00:09:03,977 --> 00:09:07,345
So welcome to Ocean Drive
 in Miami Beach, Florida.

218
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:09,147
I'm -- Actually, I'm --
 No. That's not where I'm at.

219
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:11,650
I'm on El Malecón
  in, uh, Havana, Cuba.

220
00:09:11,652 --> 00:09:13,818
So easy to get those two
 mixed up being that they're

221
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,554
only, like, 90 miles away.

222
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:18,056
And I'm not here to check out
  a Cuban restaurant. No.

223
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,491
I'm here to check out
   a Soviet joint,

224
00:09:19,493 --> 00:09:22,027
because you remember the whole
 Cuban-Soviet teamwork thing.

225
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:24,062
What do you get?
 You get a dynamite restaurant.

226
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:26,598
This is Nazdarovie.

227
00:09:29,937 --> 00:09:32,103
It's very, very good, as good
 as any place in the world.

228
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:34,072
Stroganoff.
  There is no difference

229
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:36,541
I can taste from the food here
 and food I had back in Russia.

230
00:09:36,543 --> 00:09:38,810
And that's exactly what
  Canadian-born attorney

231
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:42,547
Gregory Biniowky
  was going for in 2014,

232
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:45,317
when he turned his home
into a tribute to his ancestors.

233
00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:49,387
You are back
in the USSR in Havana.

234
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:52,591
This is prime-time place
   to have a house,

235
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:53,959
and you turned it
    into a restaurant?

236
00:09:53,961 --> 00:09:56,528
- Yeah.
  -Unbelievable, man.

237
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:58,530
Not enough people know
about the amazing cuisine

238
00:09:58,532 --> 00:10:00,165
from Russia and the Ukraine.
    I am a huge fan.

239
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:02,767
There isn't enough of it.
Yeah.

240
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:05,570
But there's plenty here, thanks
 to their Russian-rooted staff,

241
00:10:05,572 --> 00:10:09,541
including server Alexander Pena
 and Chef Irina Butorina.

242
00:10:09,543 --> 00:10:10,875
Pelmenis.

243
00:10:10,877 --> 00:10:13,111
The ravioli was<i> muy bueno.</i>

244
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:16,314
It was tasty.
It was really tasty here.

245
00:10:16,316 --> 00:10:17,749
- We're having Russian raviolis?
    -Okay.

246
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:19,517
Pelmenis.
   Pelmenis.

247
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,720
Pelmenis
  always filled with meat.

248
00:10:21,722 --> 00:10:24,923
It's one of the head dishes
   of our restaurant.
   Okay.

249
00:10:24,925 --> 00:10:27,726
Chopped pork, chopped beef...
    Beef.

250
00:10:27,728 --> 00:10:31,930
Onions, garlic,
    black pepper, salt.

251
00:10:31,932 --> 00:10:34,799
We leave this to marinate.

252
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,601
We are ready
   to prepare the dough.

253
00:10:36,603 --> 00:10:38,069
So it's making
  a traditional dough --

254
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:41,473
a little flour, a little egg
 in the middle, a little salt.

255
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:44,042
Not too much water.

256
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:45,644
Mix it in.

257
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:47,512
How much kneading?
     Five minutes.

258
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:48,780
And then how long
  do we let it rest?

259
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:50,415
For a half hour.
 And then, we roll it out?

260
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:52,050
Yeah.

261
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:54,352
How many of these has she made
  in her lifetime?

262
00:10:56,957 --> 00:10:59,157
Forty thousand.
  She didn't say 40,000.

263
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,192
You can Google it.

264
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:02,560
And then we fill it
    with the meat

265
00:11:02,562 --> 00:11:04,829
that we already
     have marinated.

266
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,598
Oh-ho, wait a second!

267
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,801
Right there, what you have
 is a little Russian tortellini.

268
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:11,870
Forty thousand and four.

269
00:11:11,872 --> 00:11:14,372
I'll keep you guys up to date.

270
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:16,107
My mother used
    to tell me that --

271
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:18,643
Excuse me, 40,005.

272
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:20,679
40,005 have been made.
   Go ahead.

273
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:22,747
They used to prepare it
    in the summer

274
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:24,249
and put it in barrels

275
00:11:24,251 --> 00:11:27,052
and keep it in the winter,
   keep 'em frozen.

276
00:11:27,054 --> 00:11:28,853
She has now made --
   Wait for it.

277
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,922
We're gonna call
 in for the total data board.

278
00:11:30,924 --> 00:11:32,424
Yes. It's in.

279
00:11:32,426 --> 00:11:34,793
40,015

280
00:11:34,795 --> 00:11:36,861
of these things
  that I can't pronounce.

281
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:38,263
Pelmenis.
   Pelmenis.

282
00:11:38,265 --> 00:11:39,531
Now we're gonna boil 'em

283
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:42,634
in a seasoned water
of laurel leaf, pepper and salt.

284
00:11:42,636 --> 00:11:44,969
Yeah.
    For 2 or 3 minutes.

285
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:48,840
Now we're going to toss
   some butter, some dill.

286
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:50,742
That is very difficult
    to get here.

287
00:11:50,744 --> 00:11:54,145
Green onions, sour cream.
    Okay.

288
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:58,616
Oh-ho-ho, this looks good.

289
00:11:58,618 --> 00:12:00,952
Outrageous.
   It's so good.

290
00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:02,921
I'm not talkin' kind of good.

291
00:12:05,025 --> 00:12:07,092
I'm not kiddin' you.
 I have to take a picture.

292
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,229
Look at that.

293
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:13,031
I gotta send this home
   to my friends.

294
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:14,899
I'm gonna bring
 in the true taste-tester

295
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:16,968
of "Triple D," my wife Lori.

296
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:22,073
Tell me that's not ridiculous.

297
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:24,209
It's delicious.
   Fantastic.

298
00:12:24,211 --> 00:12:26,544
Always a fan of sour cream,

299
00:12:26,546 --> 00:12:28,246
and the fresh herbs
   are super nice.

300
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,915
As good as it would be
 if you have it in Russia.

301
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:33,384
Amazing. I just come here
   for this every time.

302
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:34,819
I think my favorite thing,
 actually, about the restaurant

303
00:12:34,821 --> 00:12:36,221
is the view
  that you see outside.

304
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:38,223
This is the face of Havana.
    What's it called?

305
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:40,125
Malecón. It means
"the ocean boulevard."

306
00:12:40,127 --> 00:12:42,494
When you come here
     as a tourist,

307
00:12:42,496 --> 00:12:45,430
you gotta make a cruise
    down this road.

308
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:49,234
The music, the drawings,
   the people,

309
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:52,470
the beach, it's great.

310
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:54,706
Russia doesn't have a beachfront
  like that, does it?

311
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:55,774
No, it doesn't.

312
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:57,909
But it does have
  a menu like this.

313
00:12:57,911 --> 00:12:59,344
Cutlet a la Kiev.

314
00:12:59,346 --> 00:13:01,312
Have you had
chicken Kiev before?

315
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:03,281
I'm sorry. I don't wanna talk
in the middle of your moment.

316
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:04,916
I'll be right here.

317
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:06,918
They were delicious.

318
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,119
What is next?

319
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:09,554
We're going to start
    with preparing

320
00:13:09,556 --> 00:13:12,857
the aromatized butter,
    dill, parsley.

321
00:13:12,859 --> 00:13:14,793
The lime juice.

322
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:16,561
Salt, lime shells.

323
00:13:16,563 --> 00:13:18,196
The zest,
  the skin of the lime.

324
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:19,798
Yeah.
  Where is this gonna go?

325
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,633
It's going inside
     of the meat.

326
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:23,868
We freeze it
    so it doesn't melt.

327
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,403
And then we're gonna make
   the chicken?

328
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:26,738
Yeah.
    Okay.

329
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:30,141
Mix ground chicken
   with onions, garlic,

330
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:34,145
black pepper, salt.

331
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,214
Put inside the butter.

332
00:13:36,216 --> 00:13:38,082
I don't think I've ever
 seen anything get stuffed

333
00:13:38,084 --> 00:13:41,452
with just its own
  big log of butter.

334
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:43,121
Put it into flour.

335
00:13:43,123 --> 00:13:45,490
And then, we pass it
    through the egg.

336
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:47,158
Now in the breadcrumbs?

337
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,793
Two times,
   you have to bread it.

338
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:50,829
Okay.
     So the butter
    doesn't come out.

339
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:52,664
Okay. So now, we're gonna fry it
   in the oil?

340
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,098
Yeah.
  Until it turns brown

341
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,900
and then go to the oven
  and finish cooking.

342
00:13:55,902 --> 00:13:58,069
What do we serve this with?
    Mashed potatoes.

343
00:13:58,071 --> 00:13:59,704
Okay.

344
00:13:59,706 --> 00:14:01,673
And that's it.
  No sauce, just...

345
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:03,608
No sauce, the sauce is inside.
  Sauce is inside.

346
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:07,779
Oh-ho! Yahtzee!
   Look at that.

347
00:14:07,781 --> 00:14:08,847
I've had chicken Kiev.

348
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:10,181
I've never seen it
   do that, dude.

349
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:14,586
Mmm, nice and juicy.

350
00:14:14,588 --> 00:14:15,820
That's crazy.

351
00:14:15,822 --> 00:14:17,622
Wow!

352
00:14:17,624 --> 00:14:19,724
This just has flavor
  all the way through it.

353
00:14:19,726 --> 00:14:21,392
The key -- the dill.

354
00:14:21,394 --> 00:14:23,261
Oh, man.

355
00:14:25,665 --> 00:14:27,532
She said
    it is very tasty.

356
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:29,067
Oh, I thought she said
   I'm handsome.

357
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:31,269
No, no, no. This show
  is about the chicken Kiev.

358
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:32,604
Oh, it is.
      Sure, sure.

359
00:14:33,807 --> 00:14:35,240
Where'd this guy come from?

360
00:14:35,242 --> 00:14:38,142
Very succulent.
  I like the outer crust.

361
00:14:38,144 --> 00:14:40,979
It's the herbs,
the mixture of flavors.

362
00:14:42,782 --> 00:14:45,583
You fall in love with the food,
  and you keep coming.

363
00:14:45,585 --> 00:14:47,919
You tell me when you wanna open
 one of these in California.

364
00:14:49,356 --> 00:14:50,889
You're awesome, Gregory.

365
00:14:52,592 --> 00:14:54,592
Up next...
       Okay.

366
00:14:54,594 --> 00:14:57,528
...a funky, open-air spot
  behind a car wash...

367
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:00,398
<i> El loco!</i>
...firin' up rock-star ribs...

368
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,532
Delicious.

369
00:15:01,534 --> 00:15:03,568
...and dishin' out
  a Cuban classic.

370
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,183
All right, so for my final stop

371
00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:21,819
on this awesome
  Havana, Cuba, tour,

372
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:23,454
I'm in downtown Havana,

373
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:26,291
over by what used to be
 called the "Havana Hilton."

374
00:15:26,293 --> 00:15:28,026
Now, this is a little bit
   different.

375
00:15:28,028 --> 00:15:29,861
You see, they rented out
   the front yard.

376
00:15:29,863 --> 00:15:31,162
Well, they got a car wash there.

377
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:32,897
And then they rented
 out the back yard and, well,

378
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:35,466
it's this funky joint
  all the locals go to.

379
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:37,535
This is Fonda La Paila.

380
00:15:40,874 --> 00:15:43,308
Every time I come to Cuba,
 I make sure I come here.

381
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:45,343
We've been to several
restaurants around Havana.

382
00:15:45,345 --> 00:15:46,778
This is fantastic.

383
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,613
A wonderful place,
  one of my favorites.

384
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:50,114
What type of restaurant is this?

385
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:52,317
Fonda is the food
   coming out very fast.

386
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:55,053
Yeah, you come, eat, go.

387
00:15:55,055 --> 00:15:57,722
With Chef Ugo Chigon
  manning the grill

388
00:15:57,724 --> 00:16:00,959
and waiter Rodney Lugo servin'
 up meaty Cuban favorites.

389
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:02,560
You have ribs now.

390
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:06,931
This sauce is absolutely
  wonderful, marvelous.

391
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:08,399
- How do you say, again, "ribs?"
   <i> -Costilla.</i>

392
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:09,600
<i> -Costilla.</i>
- Ay!

393
00:16:09,602 --> 00:16:11,569
<i> Costilla.</i> Ay!

394
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:14,639
The barbecue sauce for the ribs.
       Yeah.

395
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:15,673
A little oil...

396
00:16:18,511 --> 00:16:19,510
Okay.

397
00:16:23,283 --> 00:16:24,549
Soy sauce.

398
00:16:24,551 --> 00:16:27,552
You say it just like a gringo.
   "Soy sauce!"

399
00:16:27,554 --> 00:16:29,620
Do you use it a lot
   in Cuban food?
<i> Sí.</i>

400
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:33,224
Comino, paprika, honey...

401
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:34,759
How do you say this in Spanish?

402
00:16:34,761 --> 00:16:36,761
<i> -Miel.</i>
<i> -Miel.</i> I knew that.

403
00:16:36,763 --> 00:16:38,329
<i> Vinagre.</i> Okay.

404
00:16:40,934 --> 00:16:42,500
- Very good sauce.
   -Thank you.

405
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:44,402
Okay. Now we're gonna make
   the marinade.

406
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:45,636
Marinade.
   Marinade.

407
00:16:45,638 --> 00:16:48,072
<i> Sí,</i> marinade.
    Okay.

408
00:16:48,074 --> 00:16:51,042
Uh...

409
00:16:51,044 --> 00:16:52,210
<i> Es una naranja agria.</i>

410
00:16:52,212 --> 00:16:55,179
Yeah. That's a --
  Sour orange. Yeah.

411
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:56,647
Ay!

412
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:58,049
Okay. Dry white wine.

413
00:16:58,051 --> 00:17:00,351
Okay.

414
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:01,686
Chiles...

415
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:04,989
Comino, doctor.
       <i> Sí.</i>

416
00:17:04,991 --> 00:17:06,457
Bay leaf, doctor.

417
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:07,925
How long is this going
   to marinate?

418
00:17:11,231 --> 00:17:14,565
And then, they sear the meat
   into the fire.

419
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:16,334
Then, to the grill.
      More slow.

420
00:17:16,336 --> 00:17:19,404
Salsa?
  In the grill, the sauce.

421
00:17:19,406 --> 00:17:21,372
And then...

422
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:23,241
Before -- before they
    serve the meat,

423
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:24,409
they -- they sauce the meat.

424
00:17:24,411 --> 00:17:25,710
<i> Poquito mas.</i>
Yeah.

425
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:28,446
Two times the sauce.
  Two times. Okay.

426
00:17:28,448 --> 00:17:30,148
This is one order?

427
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:32,617
Yeah.
       Yeah.

428
00:17:37,757 --> 00:17:39,090
The ribs are tender.

429
00:17:39,092 --> 00:17:43,127
The sauce...
   delicious.

430
00:17:43,129 --> 00:17:46,164
It tastes like a sauce
 you would expect in Cuba.

431
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:48,566
You taste the orange.
  You taste the sweet.

432
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,635
It has a lot
   of the island flavor.

433
00:17:50,637 --> 00:17:52,937
Delicious.
Thank you.

434
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:54,205
Very talented.

435
00:17:57,777 --> 00:17:59,477
Nice, juicy, sticky.

436
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:01,546
Lots of flavor, very tender.

437
00:18:01,548 --> 00:18:03,414
It's what sauce
on pork ribs is meant to be.

438
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,223
It's a nice, easy,
   relaxed feel,

439
00:18:12,225 --> 00:18:13,624
especially in the middle
   of the day.

440
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:15,726
The perfect setting
 for this island staple...

441
00:18:15,728 --> 00:18:17,061
Tostones.

442
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:18,696
...lamb cooked
 in a scratch-made marinade

443
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:20,965
and stuffed in a fried plantain.

444
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,970
All right, so...

  in this and cook?

457
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:50,661
How long?

So, the lamb is ready,<i> listo?</i>
Yeah. Yeah. It's ready.

Bay leaf...
      Rosemary...

467
00:19:05,612 --> 00:19:06,811
Rosemary? Okay.
       Yeah.

468
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:09,046
Ground oregano,
   the comino,

469
00:19:09,048 --> 00:19:11,382
and the<i> sal, sí?</i>

470
00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:13,985
This is all gonna go
 on a plantain, a tostone?
       Yeah.

471
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:15,753
So these are plantains
   that have been cooked.

472
00:19:15,755 --> 00:19:17,455
So now they're nice and soft.

473
00:19:17,457 --> 00:19:18,556
We make a hole...
    Right.

474
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:19,557
...in the --
     in the tostone.

475
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:20,958
Right.

476
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,262
There you have the hole!

477
00:19:24,264 --> 00:19:27,131
So we make these.
  Now, to the<i> aceite.</i>
Yeah.

478
00:19:30,904 --> 00:19:33,037
You grab it
   and push the meat...

479
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,840
Inside...
     ...inside it.

480
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:38,576
Now, the cheese.
 This is traditional Cuban?

481
00:19:38,578 --> 00:19:40,545
Yeah.
  Okay. Now, to the oven?

482
00:19:40,547 --> 00:19:42,079
- Yeah.
    -Okay.

483
00:19:42,081 --> 00:19:43,481
Uh, 4 minutes.
    Four --

484
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:45,149
Four minutes.
   <i> Señor Inglés.</i>

485
00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:46,851
Yeah.
   "Four minutes."

486
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,588
Ketchup.
  Ketchup. Ketchup?

487
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,657
Yeah. That's like, uh...
  Like, gringo ketchup?

488
00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:54,926
Yeah. Very pretty.

489
00:19:54,928 --> 00:19:56,761
<i> El loco!</i>
<i> Ay, el loco.</i>

490
00:20:02,168 --> 00:20:04,068
It's good?
   Fantastic.

491
00:20:08,308 --> 00:20:10,641
The lamb...

492
00:20:10,643 --> 00:20:12,443
is what makes
  the whole thing.

493
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:14,612
All the spices goin' on there,

494
00:20:14,614 --> 00:20:17,848
the nice, crunchy shell
  of the tostone --

495
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,150
delicious.

496
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:26,157
Really nice and crunchy
  and textural.

497
00:20:28,328 --> 00:20:30,261
I wish
 there would be more fondas

498
00:20:30,263 --> 00:20:32,563
like La Paila in all Cuba.

499
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:34,131
This is the kind of place

500
00:20:34,133 --> 00:20:37,501
that a lot of tourists wanna
 find because this is authentic.

501
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,569
Nice job, Chef.
       Okay.

502
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:40,037
<i> Gracias.</i>
Yeah.

503
00:20:41,808 --> 00:20:43,307
Well, I guess we can check
   Havana, Cuba,

504
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:45,076
off the bucket list,
  but don't worry.

505
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:47,311
There's "Triple D" joints
  all over this world.

506
00:20:47,313 --> 00:20:48,613
I'll be lookin' for you
   next time

507
00:20:48,615 --> 00:20:50,748
on "Diners, Drive-ins
   and Dives."

508
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,950
This is like a big
   outdoor fiesta.

509
00:20:52,952 --> 00:20:55,253
Ay, ay, we are party mans.

510
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:56,921
You are party mans?
       Yeah.

511
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:58,990
I'm a party man, too.
  <i> Tres</i> party mans!

512
00:20:58,992 --> 00:21:00,191
Yeah.

1
00:00:01,702 --> 00:00:03,235
I'm Guy Fieri, and we're
 rolling out in Havana, Cuba,

2
00:00:03,237 --> 00:00:05,170
looking for
 the world's greatest diners,

3
00:00:05,172 --> 00:00:06,805
drive-ins, and dives.

4
00:00:09,043 --> 00:00:10,309
Yep, that's right.

5
00:00:10,311 --> 00:00:12,644
We're hitting
 all the Havana hotspots...

6
00:00:12,646 --> 00:00:17,049
The wheels are off the wagon
     in Havana.

7
00:00:17,051 --> 00:00:19,518
...and the fiesta's just
  getting started...

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,086
<i> iGracias!</i>
<i> iBuenas noches!</i>

9
00:00:21,088 --> 00:00:24,323
...as we dig into the city's
  killer Cuban cuisine.

10
00:00:24,325 --> 00:00:25,791
I don't want to eat it fast,

11
00:00:25,793 --> 00:00:27,526
because I don't
  want it to go away.

12
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:28,594
From goat stew...

13
00:00:28,596 --> 00:00:29,595
It's delicious.

14
00:00:29,597 --> 00:00:30,896
...to fresh catch...

15
00:00:30,898 --> 00:00:33,032
Beautiful.
  ...house cured lamb...

16
00:00:33,034 --> 00:00:34,733
That's the best thing
 I've had since I've been here.

17
00:00:34,735 --> 00:00:36,301
...to pork and plantains...

18
00:00:36,303 --> 00:00:37,436
Fufu plantains?

19
00:00:37,438 --> 00:00:39,505
...and even
  Chinese fried rice?

20
00:00:39,507 --> 00:00:41,440
Come on down.
   It's international day.

21
00:00:41,442 --> 00:00:42,841
So bring your appetite...

22
00:00:42,843 --> 00:00:44,610
Two pounds of meat
    in here already.

23
00:00:44,612 --> 00:00:47,046
...for a feast that's muy bueno.

24
00:00:47,048 --> 00:00:49,715
Buenos días,
    welcome to Cuba.

25
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:51,750
That's all right
  here, right now,

26
00:00:51,752 --> 00:00:55,120
on a special edition
 of "Triple D" in Havana.

27
00:01:11,105 --> 00:01:13,072
You got to love it.
 "Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives"

28
00:01:13,074 --> 00:01:14,339
in Havana, Cuba.

29
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:16,275
I mean, this place
  is filled with history.

30
00:01:16,277 --> 00:01:17,910
Now right there
 across the street, well,

31
00:01:17,912 --> 00:01:19,178
that's the Presidential Palace.

32
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,913
That's where Castro
 gave a bunch of speeches,

33
00:01:20,915 --> 00:01:22,748
that's where Batista
   took off from,

34
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:25,317
and now, well, it's
 the Museum of the Revolution.

35
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:26,585
Here's the great news --

36
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:28,921
Right across the street
  a real-deal Cuban joint

37
00:01:28,923 --> 00:01:31,857
you got to check out --
  This is Al Carbón.

38
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:37,329
This restaurant,
  it is beautiful,

39
00:01:37,331 --> 00:01:38,797
so wonderfully decorated.

40
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,700
A little bit of everything that
 bridges the old and the new.

41
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:43,936
- The fish of the day.
  -Real Cuban food --

42
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:46,338
One of the best
   all around the city.

43
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,073
And in the city
  where the restaurant

44
00:01:48,075 --> 00:01:49,308
scene is exploding,

45
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,143
chef and owner Ivan Rodriguez,

46
00:01:51,145 --> 00:01:52,945
he leads the way.

47
00:01:52,947 --> 00:01:55,047
- One fish.
  -Here, he and his staff

48
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:57,616
bring a rocking vibe
  to wood fired cuisine.

49
00:01:57,618 --> 00:01:59,551
Not too many restaurant
    have a barbecue.

50
00:01:59,553 --> 00:02:02,087
Not just a barbecue,
  but a barbecue indoors.

51
00:02:02,089 --> 00:02:04,723
Yeah. The people enjoy
   to sit in the bar here.

52
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:05,958
And see --
The cooking show.

53
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,527
The cooking show.

54
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:10,629
It is a cooking show.

55
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:11,897
- He's the maestro.
    -Yeah.

56
00:02:11,899 --> 00:02:13,565
- He's a tiger.
   -He's a tiger.

57
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:14,900
Rawr!

58
00:02:14,902 --> 00:02:15,934
It's amazing so far.

59
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,803
I think it's exceeded
 our expectations.

60
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:18,971
It's been fantastic.
    I tried the lamb.

61
00:02:18,973 --> 00:02:19,671
It was great.

62
00:02:19,673 --> 00:02:20,973
Asada cordero.

63
00:02:20,975 --> 00:02:23,442
I did try the lamb,
 even though I'm a pescatarian.

64
00:02:23,444 --> 00:02:25,277
I broke my own rules
   so I could taste it,

65
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:26,512
and I'm so glad that I did.

66
00:02:26,514 --> 00:02:28,680
- Tasajo.
   -Tasajo.

67
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:29,681
Okay.

68
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:32,351
- What does it mean?
  -Lamb, dry meat.

69
00:02:32,353 --> 00:02:34,853
- With salt?
   -With salt!

70
00:02:34,855 --> 00:02:36,355
He make a cut in order
    to the salt --

71
00:02:36,357 --> 00:02:37,656
So it can get inside.

72
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:39,892
Lamb ribs.

73
00:02:39,894 --> 00:02:42,261
- Okay, so salt.
   <i> -Mucha sal.</i>

74
00:02:42,263 --> 00:02:45,164
When he cooks, it's not work.
 Look at him -- Big smile.

75
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:45,964
It's pleasure.

76
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:48,567
Tri-color --<i> Tres color.</i>

77
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:51,036
It's very important
  that it's very, very salty.

78
00:02:51,038 --> 00:02:53,639
- Everything.
  -Today -- In this salt.

79
00:02:53,641 --> 00:02:56,942
It sits in here for two days.
   So, dos días.

80
00:02:56,944 --> 00:02:58,777
You can see where it turns
  a little bit red,

81
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:00,345
so it's pulling out
  some of the moisture.

82
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,548
I mean, this is the best
  old-school method

83
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:03,415
of preservation.

84
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:05,851
He hits with some more salt.

85
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:07,986
Is this...?

86
00:03:09,323 --> 00:03:13,825
Yeah, yeah. Huh?

87
00:03:13,827 --> 00:03:14,960
Ay!

88
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:21,400
All right.
 How long does it stay there?

89
00:03:21,402 --> 00:03:22,434
21 days.

90
00:03:22,436 --> 00:03:24,603
21 days. Okay.

91
00:03:24,605 --> 00:03:27,472
Now we are going
  to prepare the lamb tasajo.

92
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:29,675
- You got it, or...?
   -Ah, yeah.

93
00:03:29,677 --> 00:03:31,476
- Yeah?
   -Come on!

94
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:34,246
Ay!

95
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:41,119
So, soak it for two, and then
 45 minutes in the hot water...

96
00:03:41,121 --> 00:03:42,120
- Yeah.
  -...so it's rehydrated.

97
00:03:42,122 --> 00:03:43,855
We shred it.

98
00:03:43,857 --> 00:03:45,891
That's our shredded lamb ribs.

99
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:49,828
There's not gonna be any flavor
  in this whatsoever.

100
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,029
Crazy. All right, Chef.

101
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:54,266
<i> -Primero, aceite.</i>
- A little oil.

102
00:03:54,268 --> 00:03:55,467
- Onions.
   -Onions.

103
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:57,002
- Garlic.
  -Green bell pepper.

104
00:03:57,004 --> 00:03:59,171
Tomate and pepper.

105
00:03:59,974 --> 00:04:01,139
Yes.

106
00:04:01,141 --> 00:04:02,908
Hey, hey, hey!

107
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,409
- Black pepper.
    -Okay.

108
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:05,944
<i> -Naranja.</i>
- That's a sour orange,

109
00:04:05,946 --> 00:04:07,279
not just regular orange.

110
00:04:07,281 --> 00:04:10,882
<i> -Jugo de tomate.</i>
- Tomato juice.

111
00:04:10,884 --> 00:04:13,352
- Hey, here Capitán.
   -Thank you.

112
00:04:13,354 --> 00:04:14,953
- All right, you ready?
   -Thank you.

113
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:16,421
Round 2.

114
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:19,324
Barbecue sauce.

115
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:21,627
Roasted vegetables
 coming off of the grill.

116
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:24,496
- Sweet potato.
 -Sweet potato?

117
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:29,735
- Finished.
   -Fantastic.

118
00:04:33,374 --> 00:04:35,073
Outrageous.

119
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:39,044
I don't want to eat it too fast,

120
00:04:39,046 --> 00:04:40,712
because I don't want
   it to go away.

121
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:42,781
Amazing richness of the lamb.

122
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:47,519
Ooh, it's got
 that shredded characteristic.

123
00:04:47,521 --> 00:04:50,389
And on the sweet potato is
 the only way you could have it.

124
00:04:50,391 --> 00:04:51,923
That's the best thing
 I've had since I've been here.

125
00:04:51,925 --> 00:04:53,659
When you get
  off the plane in Cuba,

126
00:04:53,661 --> 00:04:55,827
they should just have this
  for you just like this.

127
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:58,830
<i> Buenos días!</i>
Welcome to Cuba.

128
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:00,299
The tasajo.

129
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:03,435
The texture was really complex
 and had a lot of depth to it.

130
00:05:03,437 --> 00:05:06,738
It wasn't too salty, and I
really enjoyed the bell peppers.

131
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:07,873
That gave it, like,
  an extra little kick.

132
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,608
There is no way
  that I'm coming to Cuba

133
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,009
without bringing my mom and dad.

134
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:12,778
The sweet potato with it --

135
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,313
That took it right on
 up there, you know.

136
00:05:14,315 --> 00:05:15,781
- Tell me that's not the best.
    -Yeah.

137
00:05:15,783 --> 00:05:16,715
I love it.

138
00:05:16,717 --> 00:05:18,083
Yeah, we'll do this
  at home.

139
00:05:18,085 --> 00:05:20,085
Oh, we'll do this
   all day long.

140
00:05:20,087 --> 00:05:22,688
We do a lot of grilling,
   fresh flavors.

141
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,690
Which is basically
  the mantra here --

142
00:05:24,692 --> 00:05:26,391
fresh from land and sea.

143
00:05:26,393 --> 00:05:28,827
- Fish.
  -The fish is wonderful.

144
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,495
You know how much
    I love fish.

145
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:33,498
And you serve the whole fish,
  and you know it's so fresh.

146
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,667
It's delicious.

147
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:36,935
So, what is this dish called?

148
00:05:38,072 --> 00:05:40,172
"Fish of the day."
    Red snapper.

149
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:42,174
This is a very popular fish
   in Cuba?

150
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:43,241
<i> Sí. Muy popular.</i>

151
00:05:44,545 --> 00:05:45,510
Chimichurri sauce.

152
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:46,778
Chimichurri sauce, okay.

153
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,879
It's a platillo
  de la casa.

154
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:48,880
The house chimichurri.

155
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:50,415
It's an onion.

156
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:51,383
Cebolla.

157
00:05:51,385 --> 00:05:52,784
Garlic.

158
00:05:52,786 --> 00:05:53,852
Red pepper.

159
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,287
Rrrrred pepper!

160
00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:56,788
And green pepper.

161
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,423
- Tomate.
   -Tomate.

162
00:05:58,425 --> 00:06:01,059
Lot of parsley in Cuban food.
    Sal?

163
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:02,160
- Sal.
   -Black pepper.

164
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:03,362
- Fresh?
    -Yeah.

165
00:06:03,364 --> 00:06:04,830
- Aceite.
    -Oil.

166
00:06:04,832 --> 00:06:07,733
- Vinagre balsámico.
 -Balsamic vinegar in Cuba?

167
00:06:07,735 --> 00:06:08,934
- Yes.
   -Oh, okay.

168
00:06:08,936 --> 00:06:10,168
It's ready.

169
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:12,504
Today, the fish --

170
00:06:12,506 --> 00:06:14,039
Last night they caught it?

171
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,441
Cutting through it will really
 allow the flavor to penetrate

172
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:18,610
all the way into the fish.

173
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:20,278
- Poco de sal.
    -Salt.

174
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,080
Olive oil.

175
00:06:22,082 --> 00:06:24,249
- Lemon.
    -Okay.

176
00:06:24,251 --> 00:06:25,751
What else do we serve
   with the dish?

177
00:06:25,753 --> 00:06:27,552
- Tortilla.
   -Tortilla?

178
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:31,456
- In Havana?
    -Yes.

179
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:34,292
It's a cross
 between a flour tortilla,

180
00:06:34,294 --> 00:06:36,428
a corn tortilla, and a cracker.

181
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,433
Egg plant, pepper...

182
00:06:48,142 --> 00:06:49,875
Beautiful.

183
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,080
That bueno?

184
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:56,181
- Fantastic.
   -Gracias.

185
00:06:56,183 --> 00:06:58,150
The natural salt in the fish

186
00:06:58,152 --> 00:07:01,820
is complemented
  with the chimichurri.

187
00:07:01,822 --> 00:07:04,423
Not all chimichurri's the same.

188
00:07:04,425 --> 00:07:06,792
It tastes like the cross
  between chimichurri

189
00:07:06,794 --> 00:07:08,026
and pico de gallo.

190
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:10,829
Simple, fresh, local...

191
00:07:10,831 --> 00:07:12,898
Fantastic.

192
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,099
- Fish.
  -It's really moist.

193
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:15,600
It's not overcooked,

194
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:17,135
and it's a good complement
with the vegetables, as well.

195
00:07:17,137 --> 00:07:19,538
Definitely super fresh.
   I love the chimichurri.

196
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,506
It you want to show
   foreigners

197
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:22,941
what Cuban food is,

198
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:24,709
this is definitely the place.

199
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:26,411
When you cook on
 the grill, the true flavors

200
00:07:26,413 --> 00:07:27,679
will come out.
   It's delicious.

201
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:29,648
This guy gets it going.
   All right.

202
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,216
Let's eat the entire menu.

203
00:07:33,854 --> 00:07:35,620
Coming up...
    If you want to get

204
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:38,723
a real-deal Cuban experience --
     right here.

205
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:40,692
...a true neighborhood spot...

206
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:41,726
Everybody's welcome.

207
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:43,895
...where the dinner bell's
   ringing...

208
00:07:43,897 --> 00:07:45,363
...and the chef is singing.

209
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,446
So, I'm here in the El Vedado
  region of Havana.

210
00:08:01,448 --> 00:08:03,482
It's kind of
 like the new downtown area,

211
00:08:03,484 --> 00:08:04,916
and I'm here
  to check out a joint

212
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:07,018
where this guy is really
 preaching about the food.

213
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:11,189
And I mean, preach it.

214
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:12,958
He's preaching about
 how food should be great,

215
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,359
and this is the place to get it.

216
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:15,460
So the name is fitting.

217
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:17,929
This is La Catedral.

218
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:19,798
That's right.

219
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:26,037
Best place
 in the whole city.

220
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:28,340
- Garbanzo fritos.
  -I love it here.

221
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:30,976
I've been here pretty week
 since I've been in Cuba.

222
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,647
I was walking here,
  and I saw the line,

223
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:37,249
and I thought, "Hey,
  where there is a line

224
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:38,617
there must be good food."

225
00:08:38,619 --> 00:08:40,685
And they're coming to see
  the resident minister

226
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:43,221
of flavor,
  owner Diego Hernandez.

227
00:08:47,461 --> 00:08:50,028
Though it used to be
 a different place all together.

228
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,830
This was your mother's house?

229
00:08:51,832 --> 00:08:53,932
Yes.
It was my mother's house.

230
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:57,502
But he converted it to a holy
 house of culinary worship,

231
00:08:57,504 --> 00:08:59,170
and he's been packing
   in the masses

232
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:01,306
since he opened in 2013.

233
00:09:01,308 --> 00:09:03,842
I feel like I come from my home
 to this home.

234
00:09:03,844 --> 00:09:06,211
What ever I get
  is absolutely perfect.

235
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:07,812
Chilindrón de chivo.

236
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:09,180
That's Chilindrón de chivo,

237
00:09:09,182 --> 00:09:11,316
translated to
  "Big chili of goat"

238
00:09:11,318 --> 00:09:13,785
or "Big ol' goat stew."

239
00:09:13,787 --> 00:09:16,421
The goat stew is delicious.

240
00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:17,789
All right.
   What are we gonna make?

241
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,658
Chilindrón de chivo.

242
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,327
Did you sing that?
     Canta?

243
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,236
- So, this is goat?
   -This is goat.

244
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:34,639
First, we'll cut
and let it marinate.

245
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:35,707
In what?

246
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:36,875
Red wine,

247
00:09:36,877 --> 00:09:40,745
black pepper, salt,
  garlic,

248
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,781
bay leaf, and white pepper.

249
00:09:42,783 --> 00:09:44,316
How long is this going
    to marinate?

250
00:09:44,318 --> 00:09:45,951
- 12 hours.
   -12 hours.

251
00:09:45,953 --> 00:09:47,319
- In the oven?
   -30 minutes.

252
00:09:47,321 --> 00:09:50,155
- Maybe 45.
 -Convection oven. Super hot.

253
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:52,691
Let's make it.

254
00:09:52,693 --> 00:09:53,892
Let's go.

255
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:55,527
The oil.
 This is from Spain.

256
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:58,096
Green and red peppers.

257
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,266
Onions.

258
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:03,068
And we put the cooked goat.

259
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,569
Now we're gonna braise it.

260
00:10:04,571 --> 00:10:06,204
- And mix.
    -Okay.

261
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:08,640
Tomatoes. Ohh! Loco!

262
00:10:08,642 --> 00:10:10,141
Tomato sauce.

263
00:10:15,182 --> 00:10:17,382
Ladies and gentlemen,
  all my "Triple D" friends,

264
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:18,883
I want you to look --

265
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:22,020
Is this not
  the Cuban Reno from Hawaii?

266
00:10:22,022 --> 00:10:24,922
Take a look.

267
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:26,324
Huh?
    Did I tell you?

268
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:29,561
This is got to be
  Reno's long-lost brother.

269
00:10:29,563 --> 00:10:31,563
- Okay, vino rosso?
    -Wine.

270
00:10:31,565 --> 00:10:33,431
30 minutes.

271
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:34,699
Then we eat it.

272
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:35,667
- Yeah.
   -With what?

273
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:38,403
White rice.
  Malanga.

274
00:10:38,405 --> 00:10:41,339
The malanga is like yuca, kind
   of like a boiled root.

275
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:44,643
Vinegar with onion.

276
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:46,211
Mmm. It's good.

277
00:10:46,213 --> 00:10:50,415
And this stuff.

278
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:52,183
All right.

279
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:56,054
It's delicious --

280
00:10:56,056 --> 00:10:58,823
Rich, tender,
    but not too tender.

281
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:01,092
The flavor's great,

282
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:03,128
the nice, light white rice,

283
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:07,132
the malanga with the onions.

284
00:11:07,134 --> 00:11:08,566
That makes it perfect,

285
00:11:08,568 --> 00:11:11,036
'cause it's sweet,
    it's starchy.

286
00:11:11,038 --> 00:11:12,671
Can I feed you, please?

287
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:18,176
The wheels are off the wagon
     in Havana.

288
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:19,577
Off a little.

289
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:21,680
So what? Sorry.

290
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:23,181
Chilindrón de chivo.

291
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:24,649
The flavor is great,

292
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:26,551
and the way this cooked
   is very nice.

293
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:29,187
The meat gets really juicy.

294
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:31,956
Take a bite of the goat,
  and tell me what you think.

295
00:11:34,061 --> 00:11:35,393
Your face said everything.

296
00:11:36,997 --> 00:11:39,864
The Catedral
is a very unique place.

297
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:42,133
I love that it's one
 of these old, nice homes.

298
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:43,568
The space is beautifully done.

299
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:46,137
It's not only foreigners
  or tourists that come here.

300
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:47,539
There are a lot
  of Cuban families.

301
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,908
They can eat a really nice meal
  for a reasonable price.

302
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:52,577
Every day at 4:00,
 they have a bell.

303
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:55,113
It means, "Okay, let's go
and have some drinks

304
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:56,648
and something to eat."

305
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,083
What else?

306
00:11:58,085 --> 00:11:59,150
- Now?
    -Yeah.

307
00:11:59,152 --> 00:12:00,351
A beer.
 I need a beer.

308
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:01,886
No, not a beer.
   What are we gonna cook?

309
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:05,590
Arroz frito de Canton.

310
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:07,292
De Canton?

311
00:12:07,294 --> 00:12:09,060
- Cantonese.
   -Cantonese.

312
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:10,528
We're gonna make
    Chinese food?

313
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,330
Chinese food.

314
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:14,232
Come on down.
   It's international day.

315
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:17,502
Arroz fritooooooo!

316
00:12:17,504 --> 00:12:19,838
It's not a traditional
  Cuban dish,

317
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,139
but you find it a lot.

318
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:23,274
And you can find it here
  when we come back.

319
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:24,743
There's a few things
  that I thought I would try

320
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:26,778
when I came to Cuba.
    Not Chinese food.

321
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:38,990
Welcome back to "Triple D"
    in Havana, Cuba.

322
00:12:38,992 --> 00:12:41,860
Hanging out with my buddy Diego
 over here from The Catedral.

323
00:12:41,862 --> 00:12:43,595
Now this was
    his mom's house,

324
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:46,865
then he turned it
    into a restaurant.

325
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:48,133
They have Cuban food

326
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:50,268
with the right selection
  of international food.

327
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,537
In Cuba,
 the food we have,

328
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:56,241
it's a mix of different
cultures, Spanish, Afro,

329
00:12:56,243 --> 00:12:59,077
even French
and the Chinese culture.

330
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:01,312
Which means you can get
  dishes like this...

331
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:02,814
Arroz frito.

332
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:04,449
...AKA fried rice.

333
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:09,788
It's a mix of white rice,
pork, shrimp, chicken, and ham.

334
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,689
It's really lovely.

335
00:13:11,691 --> 00:13:13,258
Arroz frito.

336
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,226
Arroz frito.
     Fried rice.

337
00:13:15,228 --> 00:13:16,594
- Yeah.
   -Let's go.

338
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:19,063
Oil on the wok.

339
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:22,433
The pork, chicken,
and a little of soy sauce.

340
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:24,769
Okay.

341
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:27,272
Mushroom soy. Wow.

342
00:13:27,274 --> 00:13:28,706
We put ham...

343
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,608
Two pounds of meat
    in here already.

344
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:33,211
And the shrimp,
 a little onion,

345
00:13:33,213 --> 00:13:34,679
green onions,

346
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:38,149
the white rice.

347
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,517
Mushroom soy sauce?

348
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,252
Yeah.

349
00:13:48,195 --> 00:13:50,295
Bean sprout?

350
00:13:50,297 --> 00:13:52,831
Ham, egg, green onion?

351
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:53,498
Okay.

352
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,633
Put the rice in the bowl

353
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:59,237
and serve on the dish.

354
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:00,605
Magic man.

355
00:14:00,607 --> 00:14:01,673
Green onions.

356
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:03,208
There's a few things

357
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:06,444
that I thought I would try
   when I came to Cuba.

358
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:08,179
Not Chinese food.

359
00:14:14,054 --> 00:14:18,523
That's really good
     fried rice.

360
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:21,159
Little different,
 but the principles are there.

361
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:24,028
There's great texture,
  nice vegetables in there,

362
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:27,465
you cook it the right way.

363
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:28,933
You use great ingredients --

364
00:14:28,935 --> 00:14:30,235
Tender rice,

365
00:14:30,237 --> 00:14:33,104
the mushroom soy's
    a great call.

366
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:34,672
You know, I wouldn't have come
    in here and said,

367
00:14:34,674 --> 00:14:37,175
"Fried rice in Havana
   sounds like I want."

368
00:14:37,177 --> 00:14:38,343
But, see,
   this is what happens

369
00:14:38,345 --> 00:14:41,045
is you never know
    what to expect.

370
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:42,480
Arroz frito.

371
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:44,449
- Delicious.
  -It's very good.

372
00:14:44,451 --> 00:14:45,650
It's very nice.

373
00:14:45,652 --> 00:14:47,685
Is this a Cuban restaurant,

374
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:50,154
an American restaurant,
what type of restaurant?

375
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:53,424
So international Catedral.

376
00:14:53,426 --> 00:14:54,092
Yes.

377
00:14:54,094 --> 00:14:55,660
Everybody's welcome.

378
00:14:55,662 --> 00:14:58,596
It's for the people,
for the neighborhood,

379
00:14:58,598 --> 00:15:00,098
for the families.

380
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,301
Highly recommend it.

381
00:15:03,303 --> 00:15:05,136
This place is legit, man.

382
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:06,371
Gracias, chef.
     Gracias.

383
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:12,076
Up next, a homey spot
  where a good cigar...

384
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:13,511
Thank you.

385
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:14,746
...plus a great meal...

386
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:15,847
Oh, there we go!

387
00:15:15,849 --> 00:15:18,116
...equals an unforgettable
   experience.

388
00:15:18,118 --> 00:15:20,018
Come on.
there you go, Pow! Pow!

389
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:31,229
So, when "Triple D"
  visits an iconic city,

390
00:15:31,231 --> 00:15:33,531
the first thing I do
 is look for the godfathers.

391
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:34,866
Let's say you're
  in New York City.

392
00:15:34,868 --> 00:15:36,935
I'll call up Roberto
  at Don Antonio's.

393
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:39,404
If I'm in Hawaii, well,
 I'll call Reno at Fresh Catch.

394
00:15:39,406 --> 00:15:41,806
So when I come here
  to Havana, Cuba,

395
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:43,574
and I am looking
  for the real deal,

396
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:45,944
I hear there's a guy
 that's a cigar aficionado

397
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:47,245
and he's got a restaurant?

398
00:15:47,247 --> 00:15:48,513
You know I've got
  to check it out.

399
00:15:48,515 --> 00:15:51,616
This is Casa Abel.

400
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,053
It's very, very good,
  very nice.

401
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:00,925
The food is --
 It's wonderful.

402
00:16:00,927 --> 00:16:03,027
The joint that locals are loving

403
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:06,297
is a place close
  to owner Abel's heart.

404
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:10,201
It's a restaurant,
    my family house.

405
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:14,872
And they're serving up
 their own house specialities.

406
00:16:17,944 --> 00:16:20,445
That'd be beer-can chicken
  and a rum marinade

407
00:16:20,447 --> 00:16:22,880
prepared by
  Chef Juvenal Gonzales.

408
00:16:22,882 --> 00:16:24,882
It's very good.

409
00:16:24,884 --> 00:16:27,285
All right, Chef. What is
the dish we're going to make?

410
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:28,653
Pollo Casa Abel.

411
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:31,255
"The Abel House Chicken"?

412
00:16:31,257 --> 00:16:32,056
Let's go.

413
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:33,558
This is the marinade.

414
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,193
- Salt.
   -Sal, sí.

415
00:16:35,195 --> 00:16:36,794
White pepper, sugar.

416
00:16:36,796 --> 00:16:38,096
- Okay.
   -Comino.

417
00:16:38,098 --> 00:16:39,464
- Comino, oregano?
   -Oregano.

418
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:40,665
- Laurel.

419
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,433
Of all the things
I learned about Cuban cooking,

420
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:43,368
this is got to be it --

421
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:45,503
The bay leaf
is almost in everything.

422
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:48,039
Garlic, onion, cilantro.

423
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:49,407
Cilantro. Parsley.

424
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:50,908
Basil. Rum.

425
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,510
For here or for...?

426
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:53,578
No.

427
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,279
Okay.

428
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:57,882
Vinegar, white wine.

429
00:16:57,884 --> 00:16:58,816
White wine?
  Seco.

430
00:16:58,818 --> 00:16:59,484
<i> Vino seco. Sí.</i>

431
00:16:59,486 --> 00:17:00,585
<i> Vino seco.</i>

432
00:17:00,587 --> 00:17:02,053
All the white wine
 that they cook with

433
00:17:02,055 --> 00:17:03,988
is a really dry white wine.

434
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,623
I can smell the rum.

435
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:06,691
Mm-hmm.

436
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:09,293
And now push the...

437
00:17:09,295 --> 00:17:10,795
- The wing?
   -The wing.

438
00:17:10,797 --> 00:17:12,697
The wing.

439
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,465
Okay. There we go.

440
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:16,534
And how long will the chicken
 be in the marinade?

441
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:18,136
- 24 hours.
   -24 hours.

442
00:17:18,138 --> 00:17:19,337
Okay, chicken's ready.

443
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:20,438
Yeah.

444
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,773
- The beer...
    -Okay.

445
00:17:21,775 --> 00:17:23,041
...chicken here.

446
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:26,277
Now to the oven?

447
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:27,712
Ta-da!

448
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:30,648
So the chicken's cooling.
Now we're gonna make the sauce.

449
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,817
- Olive oil.
   -Olive oil.

450
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:33,951
- Butter.
    -Okay.

451
00:17:33,953 --> 00:17:35,953
- Now put some onion...
   -Little flour.

452
00:17:35,955 --> 00:17:38,356
So, just a simple,
 little pan gravy.

453
00:17:38,358 --> 00:17:39,757
- Wine.
    -Okay.

454
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:41,659
- Chicken stock?
   -Chicken stock.

455
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:43,327
- Sugar.
  -Salsa de China?

456
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:44,529
- Sí.
   -Soy sauce.

457
00:17:44,531 --> 00:17:46,030
I got to tell you something --
Out of all the joints

458
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:47,899
that we shot
 in Havana, Cuba,

459
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:50,435
we've probably used soy sauce
 50% of the time.

460
00:17:50,437 --> 00:17:51,536
I'm surprised.

461
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:53,104
I mean, it's really
 employed here.

462
00:17:53,106 --> 00:17:54,839
- Salt and pepper...
    -Okay.

463
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:55,907
The sauce is ready?

464
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:57,608
It's ready.

465
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:01,813
Now we finish the chicken
    in the sauce.

466
00:18:01,815 --> 00:18:04,082
Okay.

467
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:06,417
Come on.
There you go. Pow! Pow!

468
00:18:08,855 --> 00:18:10,621
Thank you.

469
00:18:13,126 --> 00:18:16,360
The chicken is very tender.
There's a lot of flavor in it,

470
00:18:16,362 --> 00:18:17,695
but I got to be honest,

471
00:18:17,697 --> 00:18:21,432
the kicker is the wine sauce
 and the onions.

472
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:25,103
Is this a traditional
 dish in Cuba?

473
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:26,304
No.

474
00:18:26,306 --> 00:18:27,271
Only can get it here?

475
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:28,306
- Sí.
   -Very nice.

476
00:18:28,308 --> 00:18:30,041
Good job, Chef.

477
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,680
It's tasty!

478
00:18:35,682 --> 00:18:37,949
But this place isn't
 known just for good food.

479
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:40,618
It's also one of the best spots
   for a cigar.

480
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,988
Something Abel, well,
 he knows a thing or two about.

481
00:18:52,832 --> 00:18:54,832
And that résumé
 carries into the restaurant

482
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:57,435
with the fresh local cigars
   and local rum

483
00:18:57,437 --> 00:18:59,103
are paired with Cuban classics.

484
00:19:00,507 --> 00:19:03,374
Like marinated deep-fried pork
  with mashed plantains.

485
00:19:05,445 --> 00:19:06,711
All right, Chef.

486
00:19:06,713 --> 00:19:09,780
We need pork,
  salt and pepper, comino.

487
00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:10,815
- Comino, okay.
    -Sí.

488
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:11,616
And ajo?

489
00:19:13,953 --> 00:19:15,153
How long?
 <i> Cuánto tiempo?</i>

490
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:17,455
- 20 minutes.
  -20 minutes. Okay.

491
00:19:17,457 --> 00:19:19,056
So this is not going
 into a full boil.

492
00:19:19,058 --> 00:19:20,658
We're probably
 about 250 degrees,

493
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,859
if that, right now.

494
00:19:21,861 --> 00:19:24,328
Just gonna go left --
Just go low and slow.

495
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,796
Now we're doing the...

496
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:26,898
- Plantains.
   -...plantains.

497
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,065
Fufu de plátanos.

498
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:30,134
- Fufu Plantain?
   -Fufu Plantain.

499
00:19:30,136 --> 00:19:31,369
This is African.

500
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:32,136
African.

501
00:19:32,138 --> 00:19:34,005
- Yeah.
    -Yeah.

502
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:34,906
That's new.

503
00:19:34,908 --> 00:19:35,640
A little --

504
00:19:35,642 --> 00:19:36,707
- Oil.
    -Oil.

505
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:38,242
I take a little here.

506
00:19:38,244 --> 00:19:40,511
Oh, there we go.
Using some seasoned oil.

507
00:19:41,481 --> 00:19:43,648
- Salt and pepper.
    -Okay.

508
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:47,318
A little sugar.
   Some people use orange.

509
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,119
The sour orange?

510
00:19:48,121 --> 00:19:50,421
- Sí.
    -Okay.

511
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:52,823
Now I -- How I can say?

512
00:19:52,825 --> 00:19:54,158
- Yeah, "mash."
    -Mash.

513
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,327
You're mashing it up.

514
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:58,396
Very nice.

515
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:02,433
Smells like carnitas.

516
00:20:05,605 --> 00:20:07,872
- Traditional Cuba dish?
   -Mm-hmm.

517
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:11,108
And we cook the pork
low temperature a long time.

518
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,109
Sí.

519
00:20:12,111 --> 00:20:13,144
You cook it
 all the way through

520
00:20:13,146 --> 00:20:14,345
and make it nice
  and tender,

521
00:20:14,347 --> 00:20:15,646
and then it browns a little bit
 on the outside.

522
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:16,814
That's right.

523
00:20:16,816 --> 00:20:19,650
I like the plantain
with the lime and the ajo.

524
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:22,320
It complements it well.

525
00:20:22,322 --> 00:20:24,355
Nice job, Chef.
  Thank you.

526
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,600
This is beautiful.
 Thank you, sir.

527
00:20:35,602 --> 00:20:38,936
<i> -Un placer.</i>
<i> -Mucho gusto.</i>

528
00:20:38,938 --> 00:20:41,906
Well, you can check Havana,
 Cuba, off the bucket list.

529
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:43,908
But don't worry --
 There's "Triple D" joints

530
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,243
all over this world!

531
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:46,510
I'll be looking for you
   next time

532
00:20:46,512 --> 00:20:48,879
on "Diners, Drive-Ins,
   and Dives."

533
00:20:48,881 --> 00:20:51,182
- De chivo.
  -De chivo. Okay.

534
00:20:51,184 --> 00:20:52,483
- You know what is a chivo?
  -Yeah, I know chivo.

535
00:20:53,152 --> 00:20:54,085
- Yeah.
    -Yeah.

536
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:55,286
Let me hear it.
     <i> Escuche.</i>

537
00:20:57,824 --> 00:20:59,957
<i> iGracias y buenas noches!</i>

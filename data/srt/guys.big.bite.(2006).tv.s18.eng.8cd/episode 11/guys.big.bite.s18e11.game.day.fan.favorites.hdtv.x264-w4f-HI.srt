     Welcome to "Big Bite."

3
00:00:18,319 --> 00:00:21,120
You know, here in this backyard,
 in this kitchen, I have hosted

4
00:00:21,122 --> 00:00:24,490
    some of the probably most
   outrageous game day feasts.

5
00:00:24,492 --> 00:00:26,225
    I mean, I've done it all.
      I've done the nachos.

6
00:00:26,227 --> 00:00:28,060
      I've done the tacos.
     I've done the burgers.

7
00:00:28,062 --> 00:00:29,595
   About anything in the world
       that you could ever

8
00:00:29,597 --> 00:00:32,164
      imagine to barbecue,
     I have done right here.

9
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:34,633
    But one of the number-one
 requests, you know what it is?

10
00:00:34,635 --> 00:00:37,069
             Chili.
   And not any regular chili.

11
00:00:37,071 --> 00:00:39,104
   We're talking Texas-style.

12
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:42,941
     No tomatoes, no beans,
  real deal Texas-style chili,

13
00:00:42,943 --> 00:00:44,476
    and that's what I'm gonna
         give you today.

14
00:00:44,478 --> 00:00:48,147
 My Texas-style chili is packed
  with ground beef, cubed beef,

15
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:51,617
  dried chilies, fresh chilies,
 onions, garlic, cumin and more.

16
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:53,118
 And it's served with, get this,

17
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,154
  a beer cheddar cheese sauce.

18
00:00:55,156 --> 00:00:57,122
    Oh, yeah. This is the one
   that's guaranteed to score

19
00:00:57,124 --> 00:00:58,690
       some major points.
             Get it?

20
00:00:58,692 --> 00:01:00,025
        Game day points.
           All right.

21
00:01:00,027 --> 00:01:03,162
     On the side, how about
   some elevated potato skins?

22
00:01:03,164 --> 00:01:06,265
       I'm upping the game
    on this game day classic

23
00:01:06,267 --> 00:01:09,234
     with leeks, mushrooms,
   brie cheese and prosciutto.

24
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:11,537
 And you can bet those are gonna
       fly off the plate.

25
00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:13,772
     In fact, you might want
     to make a double batch.

26
00:01:13,774 --> 00:01:15,274
           All right.
       Let's get started.

27
00:01:15,276 --> 00:01:16,875
      Dutch oven going hot.

28
00:01:16,877 --> 00:01:18,077
       Onions busted down.

29
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:20,579
     A little bit of garlic
        into my peppers.

30
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:21,947
           So listen.
          You're gonna

31
00:01:21,949 --> 00:01:23,715
   find your favorite peppers
   that you like to work with.

32
00:01:23,717 --> 00:01:25,717
           This chili
    is not outrageously hot.

33
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:28,253
   So it doesn't mean that you
  have to go with the big heat.

34
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:31,423
         But we're gonna
  use some Anaheims right here.

35
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:32,958
              Okay.
       And we got a bunch

36
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,726
   a bunch of dry chilies that
 we're gonna bust into as well.

37
00:01:34,728 --> 00:01:37,396
     Now, I'm gonna cut 'em
 down into a pretty usable size.

38
00:01:37,398 --> 00:01:39,364
  Actually, let me go ahead and
  drop some of these now 'cause

39
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:41,333
    it's gonna take some time
          to sweat 'em.

40
00:01:41,335 --> 00:01:44,470
  So a little bit of olive oil.

41
00:01:44,472 --> 00:01:48,240
         We'll get down
   with the onions right now.

42
00:01:48,242 --> 00:01:49,975
 And this is, just like I said,

43
00:01:49,977 --> 00:01:53,579
     no beans, no tomatoes.

44
00:01:53,581 --> 00:01:54,947
    And that's what's funny.

45
00:01:54,949 --> 00:01:56,315
  Because when you give people
        chili like this,

46
00:01:56,317 --> 00:01:57,749
   they're like, "Hey, I think
    you're missing something.

47
00:01:57,751 --> 00:01:59,418
       This kind of looks
       like a meat sauce."

48
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:03,021
  Well, you got to remember --
        chili con carne.

49
00:02:03,023 --> 00:02:05,057
        Meat and pepper.

50
00:02:05,059 --> 00:02:06,825
              Okay.

51
00:02:06,827 --> 00:02:09,862
        Drop those down.

52
00:02:09,864 --> 00:02:12,631
           A great way
   to break this chili down --

53
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:13,999
           split 'em,

54
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:17,402
    take the seeds, not a lot
   of membrane inside of here.

55
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:19,037
       That...just the key

56
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:22,608
      is just to make sure
   we got some uniform sizes.

57
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:25,377
          There we go.

58
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,045
         Some red bell.

59
00:02:33,154 --> 00:02:35,287
              Okay.

60
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:37,623
         Drop those in.
          Look at that.

61
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:39,391
     Just sweating up nice.

62
00:02:39,393 --> 00:02:40,626
     This Fresno chili here,

63
00:02:40,628 --> 00:02:42,294
       I'm not too worried
      about the heat on it.

64
00:02:42,296 --> 00:02:43,662
          Pretty mild.

65
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:47,733
      So I'll just give it
 a couple slices down the front.

66
00:02:47,735 --> 00:02:51,036
 And I won't add that garlic yet
because I don't want it to burn.

67
00:02:51,038 --> 00:02:52,771
     And I got a lot of heat
    going in this right now.

68
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:54,406
      So far, so good, huh?

69
00:02:54,408 --> 00:02:56,542
              Okay.

70
00:02:56,544 --> 00:02:59,344
Let this continue to sweat down.

71
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:01,146
 Add a little bit of salt to it.

72
00:03:01,148 --> 00:03:02,447
   Let's get into dry chilies.

73
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:05,951
       Now, this is really
  the foundation of this chili.

74
00:03:05,953 --> 00:03:07,553
So what we're first starting off

75
00:03:07,555 --> 00:03:11,223
  is with some Chile de arbol,
    which is nice and spicy.

76
00:03:11,225 --> 00:03:15,194
  The ancho and Guajillo chile,

77
00:03:15,196 --> 00:03:17,763
          which, to me,
    is my favorite dry chili.

78
00:03:17,765 --> 00:03:19,865
     And so the ancho's deep
            and rich.

79
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:22,367
       The Guajillo's got
  a nice little spice and kick.

80
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:23,702
         And, of course,
       the Chile de arbol

81
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:25,737
  has definitely got the heat.

82
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:27,306
        So taking those,

83
00:03:27,308 --> 00:03:29,808
  charring 'em is the beginning
          of this dish.

84
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,343
 And, believe it or not, the red
   color that's gonna come out

85
00:03:31,345 --> 00:03:32,744
     is gonna be outrageous.

86
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:33,845
     So these will sit here
           and toast.

87
00:03:33,847 --> 00:03:35,647
 Get a little more heat on that.

88
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:37,349
          There we go.

89
00:03:37,351 --> 00:03:40,285
      Let me get this stuff
         in the compost.

90
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:41,820
 And let's talk about potatoes.

91
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:44,289
       So a lot of people
   show up for game day feast.

92
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:47,359
  And they're expecting the --
      the regular old fare.

93
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:48,894
           We're gonna
      do some potato skins.

94
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:50,796
  Oh, but we're gonna fill 'em
    with brie and prosciutto.

95
00:03:50,798 --> 00:03:52,164
     Just got to knock it--

96
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:54,366
   you just can't let 'em know
         what's coming.

97
00:03:54,368 --> 00:03:55,634
    Got to give 'em a little
            surprise.

98
00:03:55,636 --> 00:04:00,072
    So here is some beautiful
     baked Russet potatoes.

99
00:04:00,074 --> 00:04:01,306
      So what I'm gonna do.

100
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:03,242
          There's a key
 of where I want to slice these.

101
00:04:03,244 --> 00:04:05,644
              Okay.
    If I slice 'em like this,

102
00:04:05,646 --> 00:04:07,613
         then I'm gonna
  get these really flat boats.

103
00:04:07,615 --> 00:04:10,482
        What I want to do
    is slice 'em on the flat.

104
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:11,617
              Okay.

105
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:13,385
            Like so.

106
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:15,621
 Take 'em on the flat like this,

107
00:04:15,623 --> 00:04:20,058
        carve into them,
   leaving about a 1/4 inch --

108
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,727
    leaving about a 1/4 inch

109
00:04:21,729 --> 00:04:24,930
    of the flesh around there
 so they don't become too thin.

110
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:26,632
 Because what's gonna happen is,

111
00:04:26,634 --> 00:04:29,568
   after I take all this flesh
          out of them,

112
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:30,669
    let them cool down a bit.

113
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:31,837
  Then I'm gonna deep fry 'em.

114
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:33,572
   What do you think of that?

115
00:04:33,574 --> 00:04:36,575
                     ♪♪

116
00:04:42,216 --> 00:04:44,650
           All right.
        And the last one.

117
00:04:44,652 --> 00:04:47,219
       Now, these potatoes
  are still a little bit warm,

118
00:04:47,221 --> 00:04:49,321
          so I'm gonna
  let 'em cool down here a bit.

119
00:04:49,323 --> 00:04:51,123
       And you got to save
      those potato innards.

120
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,624
             I mean,
 you're talking potato pancakes.

121
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,259
        You got all kinds
        of options there.

122
00:04:54,261 --> 00:04:55,794
           All right.
    So let me do this first.

123
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:57,195
        Um, the Guaji...

124
00:04:57,197 --> 00:04:59,865
  The -- the peppers over here
  have really toasted up nice.

125
00:04:59,867 --> 00:05:01,433
    I don't want 'em to burn.

126
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:03,835
 So now, I'm gonna reconstitute
   'em with just a little bit

127
00:05:03,837 --> 00:05:05,570
          of hot water.
              Okay.

128
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:08,974
            I'm gonna
 do it right there in that pan.

129
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:12,978
       That is a hot pan.

130
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,446
       Little more water.

131
00:05:14,448 --> 00:05:16,248
  And we'll just let those kind
    of hang out for a second.

132
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,917
 And those are gonna go directly
into the chili in just a minute.

133
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:20,819
     Speaking of the chili,
   I need to get those peppers

134
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:22,621
     and onions out of there

135
00:05:22,623 --> 00:05:26,858
     because now I have got
         some top round

136
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:27,959
    that I want to brown off.

137
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:28,994
   And we're talking about --

138
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:30,128
         I don't want it
       to be interrupted.

139
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,797
     I really want to build
           some crust,

140
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:33,398
   kind of like we're searing
          a short rib.

141
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,867
      So what I want to do
      is get all these out

142
00:05:35,869 --> 00:05:37,636
 'cause you leave just a little
      bit of this in there,

143
00:05:37,638 --> 00:05:38,704
   there's a lot of moisture.

144
00:05:38,706 --> 00:05:39,905
     It will keep it from --

145
00:05:39,907 --> 00:05:42,407
       It'll keep the meat
    from really browning up.

146
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:45,243
 It's just chasing these around
         inside of here.

147
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:47,179
          There we go.
              Okay.

148
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:49,614
           Over here.
 Let that continue to stay hot.

149
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:51,016
       We'll go over here.
      There's ground beef.

150
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:52,284
    But right now, the roast.

151
00:05:52,286 --> 00:05:53,552
   Now, this is a great thing.

152
00:05:53,554 --> 00:05:55,887
  We're talking about stew meat
           right here.

153
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:57,255
   We're talk-- Look at that.

154
00:05:57,257 --> 00:05:58,423
       Look how beautiful.

155
00:05:58,425 --> 00:06:00,025
              Huh?

156
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:02,160
      So we'll just hit it
        with a little --

157
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:04,629
  a little touch of some salt.

158
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:06,164
    And we'll just drop it --

159
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,966
     Crank that pan back up.

160
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:10,302
         Right back in.

161
00:06:10,304 --> 00:06:11,403
          There we go.

162
00:06:11,405 --> 00:06:12,904
     Nice little sear gonna
         happen to that.

163
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:14,072
           Now, I also
      have some ground beef

164
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:15,140
        that I'll put in
        in a little bit.

165
00:06:15,142 --> 00:06:16,775
         I like to have
      two of the textures.

166
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:18,610
          This is gonna
    be really nice and chewy.

167
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:20,812
       It's got some real,
     great steak-feel to it.

168
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:22,013
  But it will be super tender.

169
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:23,482
   And then, that ground beef.

170
00:06:23,484 --> 00:06:25,650
  Well, that just kind of works
 its way around all the peppers

171
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:27,886
       and all that sauce
   that's gonna be happening.

172
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:29,955
              Okay.
    We'll let that brown up.

173
00:06:29,957 --> 00:06:31,957
         Now, the skins.

174
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:33,458
 What's gonna happen with these?

175
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:36,027
Well, what I'm gonna do is I got
  a little bit of the texture,

176
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:37,596
      little bit of potato
       left on the inside.

177
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:40,198
    Drop 'em in at about 350.

178
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,366
      And here's the beauty
           with these.

179
00:06:41,368 --> 00:06:43,068
     We're gonna stuff 'em.
            Oh, yeah.

180
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:46,371
  So, I want you to think about
  a gigantic hollow french fry

181
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:48,006
      that we're gonna jam
       some prosciutto in,

182
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:49,508
   some brie, some mushrooms.

183
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,976
I mean, the list goes on and on.

184
00:06:50,978 --> 00:06:53,278
    So let me put these down.
       You guys come back.

185
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,013
         We'll continue
      to work on the chili.

186
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:57,215
         We got so many
      big flavors going on.

187
00:06:57,217 --> 00:06:59,718
           And this is
all for that big game day feast.

188
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,786
        See you in a bit.

189
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:54,326
     So it's game day feast

190
00:09:54,328 --> 00:09:56,161
    here at the Fieri house,
        in the backyard.

191
00:09:56,163 --> 00:09:59,331
        And yes, game day
  and leeks do go hand-in-hand.

192
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:01,733
       I've got some leeks
   that I'm gonna be sautéing,

193
00:10:01,735 --> 00:10:04,135
        here in a second,
  with some cremini mushrooms.

194
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:06,638
     But, uh, I'll show you
   this little leek technique.

195
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,507
  Remember when the leek grows,
   it's growing up like this.

196
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:10,842
   So the opportunity for sand

197
00:10:10,844 --> 00:10:13,244
     and dirt and everything
to fall down into those crevices

198
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:15,780
           is really,
  uh, is really, uh, happening.

199
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:18,416
      So what we want to do
         is I cut mine.

200
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:20,452
        Makes it a little
      bit easier to clean.

201
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:22,654
  And then, I'll just give 'em
      a quick little chop,

202
00:10:22,656 --> 00:10:23,922
    drop 'em into the water.

203
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:25,824
     I can swirl 'em around
          with my hand

204
00:10:25,826 --> 00:10:27,492
      and just kind of wash
         'em like that,

205
00:10:27,494 --> 00:10:29,761
   or rinse 'em, I should say.

206
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:32,464
  Some people leave the rounds
  together, but what I find is

207
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:35,133
that if they -- the rounds don't
  get completely broken apart,

208
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,435
        you have a chance
  of getting yourself some sand

209
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:38,803
     and some dirt into it.

210
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:41,606
    So this is all gonna come
            together.

211
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:42,841
      Well, I'll just do it
          with my hand.

212
00:10:42,843 --> 00:10:44,042
 This is all gonna come together

213
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:46,478
         for a fantastic
      stuffed potato skin.

214
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,413
 And, actually, I've got to drop
    some of the potato skins.

215
00:10:48,415 --> 00:10:50,782
    So let me let this settle
     down here for a second.

216
00:10:50,784 --> 00:10:54,519
  Some baked potatoes just left
   with about a 1/4 inch, uh,

217
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:55,754
      interior right there.

218
00:10:55,756 --> 00:10:57,922
           Salted them
      before I roasted 'em.

219
00:10:57,924 --> 00:11:00,425
       And we'll drop 'em
       in 350-degree oil.

220
00:11:00,427 --> 00:11:02,727
            And yes,
   I want these to almost get

221
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:05,263
 like a hollowed-out french fry.

222
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:06,765
              Okay.
     Almost potato chip-like

223
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:09,534
 because we're gonna be throwing
in some brie cheese, prosciutto,

224
00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:10,869
and some mushrooms and all that.

225
00:11:10,871 --> 00:11:12,270
     And speaking of which,
          I need to get

226
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:14,572
my leeks going here in a second.

227
00:11:14,574 --> 00:11:17,609
So couple tablespoons of butter.

228
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:24,082
       And I'm just gonna
      shake the leeks off.

229
00:11:26,053 --> 00:11:27,619
     Drop 'em in the butter.
   And I have some ground beef

230
00:11:27,621 --> 00:11:30,955
         going over here
with some 1-inch cubes of chuck.

231
00:11:30,957 --> 00:11:32,290
  And I cooked those in the oil

232
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:34,959
     that I had just sweated
   some peppers and onions in.

233
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:37,862
 And in we'll go with the leeks.

234
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:39,264
   And then, over there, also,

235
00:11:39,266 --> 00:11:42,267
   I have some steeped peppers
that I kind of toasted off a bit

236
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:44,769
        to get nice and,
    uh, well, nice and rustic

237
00:11:44,771 --> 00:11:46,671
      because we're making
       Texas-style chili.

238
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:49,174
       No beans and no --
        and no tomatoes.

239
00:11:49,176 --> 00:11:50,175
              Okay.

240
00:11:50,177 --> 00:11:53,011
         Drop these in.

241
00:11:53,013 --> 00:11:54,145
         Set this aside.

242
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:56,214
     Creminis, my favorite.

243
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:57,716
        I'm telling you,
  one of my favorite mushrooms.

244
00:11:57,718 --> 00:12:00,051
           I can't say
  it's absolutely my favorite,

245
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:02,987
    but it definitely is one
          of the best.

246
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:04,689
     Really nice and meaty.

247
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:07,826
     Lots of really defined
        mushroom flavor.

248
00:12:07,828 --> 00:12:10,462
      And we're gonna cook
  these down with these leeks.

249
00:12:10,464 --> 00:12:11,996
    It'll work out perfectly.

250
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:15,166
                     ♪♪

251
00:12:19,506 --> 00:12:21,639
           All right.
         That's enough.

252
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:23,475
              Okay.

253
00:12:27,781 --> 00:12:30,515
      Bring it right over.
         Drop these in.

254
00:12:30,517 --> 00:12:31,516
          And you know
      what this needs here?

255
00:12:31,518 --> 00:12:34,018
Is just a little touch of thyme.

256
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:37,889
     I got some fresh thyme
          standing by.

257
00:12:37,891 --> 00:12:39,424
      That's all gonna cook
         down together.

258
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:41,092
 Throw a little more heat on it.

259
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:45,897
        And all the thyme
       comes out together.

260
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:47,398
       And just the leaves
          of the thyme.

261
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,867
              Okay.
        I know this seems

262
00:12:48,869 --> 00:12:51,569
 a little bit more refined than
 you're thinking game day food.

263
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:53,471
         But, you know,
    when you say potato skin

264
00:12:53,473 --> 00:12:55,673
   and then you say, "But I'm
   stuffing it with mushrooms,

265
00:12:55,675 --> 00:12:57,642
  and brie and prosciutto," you
      can get away with it.

266
00:12:57,644 --> 00:12:58,743
           All right.
      Now, back over here.

267
00:12:58,745 --> 00:13:00,411
   Let's take a look at this.

268
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:02,981
  The meat looks great, getting
   a nice little brown to it.

269
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:05,049
    That's what I was trying
     to achieve with that is

270
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:07,185
 just get a little crust on it.
              Okay.

271
00:13:07,187 --> 00:13:08,386
       What does it need?

272
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:11,923
   Well, it needs a little bit
         of this garlic.

273
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:14,826
    I held out on the garlic
      till the last moment

274
00:13:14,828 --> 00:13:17,929
      because I didn't want
           it to burn.

275
00:13:17,931 --> 00:13:20,165
        And I got to get
        these peppers in.

276
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:23,802
Let's get over to these peppers.

277
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:25,170
         Ow, hot handle.

278
00:13:25,172 --> 00:13:27,338
 And I want that liquid and all.

279
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:32,076
  So I have these reconstituted
           Guajillos,

280
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:35,613
   Chile de arbol and anchos.

281
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,782
              Okay.

282
00:13:37,784 --> 00:13:39,217
            Hit that.

283
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:41,085
      Little bit of power.

284
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:42,854
            Puree it.

285
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:53,164
          There we go.

286
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,133
  We'll dump this right in here
        on with the meat,

287
00:13:55,135 --> 00:13:56,734
       in with that garlic
       that I just added.

288
00:13:56,736 --> 00:13:58,903
     That's where your real
      flavor's coming from.

289
00:13:58,905 --> 00:14:01,206
   So you look at this and you
 go, "Well, it's red like chili,

290
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:03,341
  but there's no tomato in it?"
              Nope.

291
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:05,977
           No tomato.

292
00:14:05,979 --> 00:14:08,112
          There we go.
      Let me drop this in.

293
00:14:08,114 --> 00:14:11,549
   Sweated peppers and onions
    that we had from earlier.

294
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:13,251
     And that all gets mixed
            together.

295
00:14:13,253 --> 00:14:14,986
          Look at that.
         Look -- Just --

296
00:14:14,988 --> 00:14:17,055
I mean, take a look inside this.
             Now...

297
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:19,624
    Now it's time to go build
   another layer of seasoning.

298
00:14:19,626 --> 00:14:21,960
     So I've done some salt
           and pepper.

299
00:14:21,962 --> 00:14:23,761
 Got the peppers and the garlic.

300
00:14:23,763 --> 00:14:27,065
      Now we'll do a touch
           of Cayenne.

301
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:28,900
        A little oregano.

302
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:30,335
     A little bit of cumin.

303
00:14:30,337 --> 00:14:32,136
    Got to have a little kiss
          of cinnamon.

304
00:14:32,138 --> 00:14:34,205
       Not too much of it.
          Just a touch.

305
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:36,808
    Now, this all gets mixed
            together

306
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:39,911
        and really gonna
    build a big base flavor.

307
00:14:39,913 --> 00:14:41,379
 But I've got to get some liquid
             in here

308
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,081
  to help cook down that meat.

309
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,549
      So we'll get in here.

310
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:47,085
     2 quarts of beef stock.
We're gonna let this go in here.

311
00:14:47,087 --> 00:14:49,287
It's gonna cook down, believe it
     or not, for two hours.

312
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:50,755
     So I've got my creminis

313
00:14:50,757 --> 00:14:53,491
and my leeks getting ready to go
  for my stuffed potato skins.

314
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:55,426
       And my potato skins
   are just finishing up now.

315
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:57,495
          Here's chili.
     Cheese sauce coming up.

316
00:14:57,497 --> 00:14:59,063
      It's game day feast.

317
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:00,832
       And this is exactly
      how I like to do it.

318
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:01,933
    See you in a little bit.

319
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:12,644
   Welcome back to "Big Bite."

320
00:15:12,646 --> 00:15:13,811
    Oh, man, I'm telling you,

321
00:15:13,813 --> 00:15:15,546
    it's all coming together,
            finally.

322
00:15:15,548 --> 00:15:16,981
  Yes, I'm browning the butter.

323
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:18,116
 That's what you expect to find

324
00:15:18,118 --> 00:15:19,717
       on a game day feast
       at the Fieri house.

325
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:22,086
    Now, I'm actually making
   some roux because I'm gonna

326
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:25,123
     make some beer cheddar
   cheese sauce for my chili.

327
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:30,595
 So, just a little bit of flour
     to go with that butter.

328
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:33,164
    Make a quick little roux.

329
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,199
     Basically, equal parts.

330
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:37,402
  Let's see where that gets us.

331
00:15:37,404 --> 00:15:38,703
          There we go.

332
00:15:38,705 --> 00:15:40,638
          Toast it off.
         There you are.

333
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,274
   What do you have back here
    in this cauldron of fun?

334
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,410
        Well, you've got
     some Texas-style chili.

335
00:15:45,412 --> 00:15:46,811
  All that beautiful red color,

336
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:48,246
    not coming from tomatoes.
              Nope.

337
00:15:48,248 --> 00:15:51,916
      We've got a bunch of,
  uh, Guajillo peppers, ancho,

338
00:15:51,918 --> 00:15:53,217
     little Chile de arbol.

339
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:54,652
      We got some poblanos.

340
00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:56,821
 We got some onions, some garlic
   and, then, some stew beef,

341
00:15:56,823 --> 00:15:59,090
      some ground beef, uh,
      all coming together.

342
00:15:59,092 --> 00:16:01,192
 It is gonna be quite fantastic.

343
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:02,727
   And then, right here, well,

344
00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:06,431
    some mushrooms and leeks
 to go in our stuffed potatoes.

345
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:07,966
      So these are actually
          potato skins.

346
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:10,468
    Took some baked potatoes,
   scooped 'em out, fried 'em.

347
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,836
        Nice and crunchy.
          Look at that.

348
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:14,639
    Almost like a, uh, cross
   between a hollow french fry

349
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:16,341
       and a potato chip.
       Gonna go in there.

350
00:16:16,343 --> 00:16:17,675
  I'll get to that in a second.

351
00:16:17,677 --> 00:16:25,283
      But in the meantime,
  we need to get a little beer.

352
00:16:25,285 --> 00:16:27,819
   Beer cheddar cheese sauce.

353
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:30,221
  I mean, I like a cheese sauce
       like anybody does,

354
00:16:30,223 --> 00:16:31,990
  but when you're gonna make it

355
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:35,560
      and it's standing up
  against big flavors like, uh,

356
00:16:35,562 --> 00:16:37,962
 a Texas-style chili, you can't
     just go out of the can

357
00:16:37,964 --> 00:16:39,263
         with this one.

358
00:16:39,265 --> 00:16:41,933
      So start with a roux,
simple 50-50 of fat and flour --

359
00:16:41,935 --> 00:16:43,701
        butter and flour,
     a little half-and-half.

360
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:45,036
   Not too much half-and-half

361
00:16:45,038 --> 00:16:46,504
     'cause we're adding in
          a full beer.

362
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:49,474
 Nice amber beer so you're gonna
get that deep, rich beer flavor.

363
00:16:49,476 --> 00:16:50,808
 Dropping in some sharp cheddar,

364
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,577
         grated, slowly,
      little bit at a time

365
00:16:52,579 --> 00:16:55,546
     so it doesn't seize up
 and get into that cheese ball.

366
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:57,248
   A little touch of Cayenne.

367
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,383
            And then,
    this is where the flavors

368
00:16:58,385 --> 00:16:59,984
     get a little bit funky.
          Dry mustard.

369
00:16:59,986 --> 00:17:03,788
  Got to have that little tang
 in there from the dry mustard.

370
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,690
 A little bit of Worcestershire.

371
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:09,027
   A little touch of paprika.
          There we are.

372
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:10,828
    Stir in a little bit more
            of this,

373
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:12,130
    and I got one more cheese

374
00:17:12,132 --> 00:17:15,266
     to add to this to make
   it really nice and velvety.

375
00:17:15,268 --> 00:17:17,201
       And that will be...

376
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:20,304
     Exactly. Cream cheese.
              Okay.

377
00:17:20,306 --> 00:17:22,373
        I'll let that go.

378
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,343
     Get some cream cheese.

379
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:27,545
    I said, "Game day food."
         I did not say,

380
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:29,447
   "This is the health show."
              Okay.

381
00:17:29,449 --> 00:17:30,982
   So we've got cream cheese.

382
00:17:30,984 --> 00:17:33,184
          We got beer.
        We've got chili.

383
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:35,153
      We'll lay that right
          in like that.

384
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:36,187
        Let it cook down.

385
00:17:36,189 --> 00:17:37,488
       Don't let it burn.

386
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:40,324
      And that can compete
  and stand up to that big, uh,

387
00:17:40,326 --> 00:17:42,093
      that big Texas chili.
              Okay.

388
00:17:42,095 --> 00:17:45,196
       Let me get a little
     "S" and "P" into this.

389
00:17:45,198 --> 00:17:46,964
       And we'll just let
      this go low-and-slow

390
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:49,333
       until it breaks up
       that cream cheese.

391
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:50,501
          There we go.
              Okay.

392
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:52,070
           Let me talk
  about this chili real quick.

393
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:54,639
 The chili, I mean, this has got
 a super, important role in this

394
00:17:54,641 --> 00:17:56,140
 because we can stuff the chili

395
00:17:56,142 --> 00:17:57,341
  into these, uh, potato skins.

396
00:17:57,343 --> 00:17:58,810
There's a lot that could happen.

397
00:17:58,812 --> 00:18:03,214
 But what I want to do right now
is pour myself an ice cold beer.

398
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:05,216
   I want to get a little bit
            of beer,

399
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:07,552
 and I want to get a little bit
      of masa, masa harina.

400
00:18:07,554 --> 00:18:10,621
    This is what you'd make,
 uh, tamales or tortillas with.

401
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:11,889
     If you don't have masa,

402
00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:13,424
  don't worry about running out
         to go grab it.

403
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:16,527
   All you're gonna need to do
   is use some regular flour.

404
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:18,696
       But I'm just gonna
  cut it a little bit into this

405
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:20,031
  so it doesn't clump up on me

406
00:18:20,033 --> 00:18:21,399
    when I drop it in there.

407
00:18:21,401 --> 00:18:24,268
           So maybe...
    that's 2 big tablespoons.

408
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,603
              Okay.

409
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:29,073
           And I also
    want to add just a touch.

410
00:18:29,075 --> 00:18:30,141
              Whoa.

411
00:18:30,143 --> 00:18:31,175
      Did I get that on me?

412
00:18:31,177 --> 00:18:33,411
    A little bit of paprika.

413
00:18:33,413 --> 00:18:35,680
          There we go.

414
00:18:35,682 --> 00:18:37,949
           Excellent.
              Okay.

415
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:40,852
   So we're gonna mix this up.
  It's kind of dissolved there,

416
00:18:40,854 --> 00:18:42,086
   kind of like you're making
            a slurry.

417
00:18:42,088 --> 00:18:43,488
        You get the idea.

418
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,022
    I'm gonna turn that heat
       down a little bit.

419
00:18:45,024 --> 00:18:46,290
   That thing's rolling hard.

420
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,192
      Takes about two hours
   for that really to reduce.

421
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:52,730
 We have 2 quarts of beef stock
       that went into it.

422
00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:57,101
      So we'll just slowly
      incorporate this in.

423
00:18:57,103 --> 00:18:59,237
     And this is gonna work
    as an awesome thickener.

424
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:02,240
        It kind of plays
 right into the theme of Texas,

425
00:19:02,242 --> 00:19:04,208
     and chili and Tex-Mex.

426
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:05,943
Some nice beer flavor into that.

427
00:19:05,945 --> 00:19:08,412
    And, again, no tomatoes,
            no beans.

428
00:19:08,414 --> 00:19:11,782
     All right. There we go.
              Okay.

429
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:13,351
       So this is starting
       to melt down nice.

430
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:15,620
 You'll see a nice little cheese
    sauce coming out of that.

431
00:19:15,622 --> 00:19:16,954
    So while that is melting,

432
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:20,291
       let's get over here
   and talk about these skins.

433
00:19:20,293 --> 00:19:22,860
  Now, the skins, like I said,

434
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:25,129
  "You have leftover potatoes.

435
00:19:25,131 --> 00:19:26,564
      What are you gonna do
           with them?"

436
00:19:26,566 --> 00:19:28,466
    Well, we're gonna take...

437
00:19:28,468 --> 00:19:31,936
  Put a little bit of mushroom
mixture in there with the leeks.

438
00:19:31,938 --> 00:19:33,638
              Okay.

439
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,940
        We'll peel off...

440
00:19:35,942 --> 00:19:37,175
          There you go.
           This is...

441
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:38,776
    When you think "Game Day"
     at my house, you think,

442
00:19:38,778 --> 00:19:41,879
           "Of course,
there's gonna be a little brie."

443
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:44,282
 So we'll crumble a little brie
            in there.

444
00:19:44,284 --> 00:19:46,250
     And then, what would be
       the next thought --

445
00:19:46,252 --> 00:19:47,685
    "Okay, yeah. Prosciutto."

446
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:50,121
        There's gonna be
some Italian cold-cuts for sure.

447
00:19:50,123 --> 00:19:52,723
        So look at this.
          There you go.

448
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:55,826
      Some nice prosciutto,
         thinly sliced.

449
00:19:55,828 --> 00:19:58,596
       We'll just tear off
          a few pieces.

450
00:19:58,598 --> 00:19:59,964
     Lay it right up on top.

451
00:19:59,966 --> 00:20:01,799
  That'll get nice and crusty,
       kind of like bacon.

452
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:03,267
    So I'll knock these out.

453
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:04,969
          Fill 'em up.
      Pop 'em in the oven.

454
00:20:04,971 --> 00:20:06,504
   Let 'em melt one more time.

455
00:20:06,506 --> 00:20:07,772
   Cheese sauce will be done.

456
00:20:07,774 --> 00:20:08,973
   The chili's thickening up.

457
00:20:08,975 --> 00:20:10,575
       When you come back,
         it's game day.

458
00:20:10,577 --> 00:20:12,143
   I don't know who's playing,
      but it doesn't matter

459
00:20:12,145 --> 00:20:14,212
      because this is gonna
           be a feast.

460
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:15,446
    See you in a little bit.

461
00:20:24,257 --> 00:20:25,456
              Whoa.
        Coming over hot.

462
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:28,292
     Look at those bad boys.
              Huh?

463
00:20:28,294 --> 00:20:30,895
       That's potato skins
 like you've never seen before.

464
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:32,096
     Cooked these potatoes.

465
00:20:32,098 --> 00:20:33,931
        Scooped 'em out.
         Deep fried 'em.

466
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:35,866
  Filled 'em with some cremini
       mushrooms, some...

467
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:37,235
      And some, uh, leeks.

468
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:39,704
 Then a little brie, of course.
     Isn't it tailgate time?

469
00:20:39,706 --> 00:20:41,439
               No?
    And a little prosciutto.

470
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:42,907
   That's exactly how we do it
       at the Fieri house.

471
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:44,775
        Some cheese sauce
       made with some beer

472
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:46,577
        and some cheddar
   and a little cream cheese.

473
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:49,313
And then the star of the show --
   Let me turn down some heat.

474
00:20:49,315 --> 00:20:50,715
    The start of the show --

475
00:20:50,717 --> 00:20:53,751
  this true Texas-style chili.

476
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:55,152
 You see that beautiful red hue.

477
00:20:55,154 --> 00:20:57,455
  There's no tomatoes in that.
        There's no beans.

478
00:20:57,457 --> 00:21:03,761
       But there is a mess
 of hot peppers, fresh peppers.

479
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:05,396
 We got a little bit of garlic.

480
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:06,631
          We got beer.

481
00:21:06,633 --> 00:21:09,634
   We got a little masa harina
        to tighten it up.

482
00:21:09,636 --> 00:21:12,270
  And you take a look at that,
      ladies and gentlemen.

483
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:15,072
  Tell me that is not gorgeous.

484
00:21:15,074 --> 00:21:16,340
           Fantastic.

485
00:21:16,342 --> 00:21:18,276
   Grab one of these bad boys.

486
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:19,477
          Drop it down.

487
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:22,446
     Got myself a cold beer.

488
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:24,282
        I'm just tasting,
 just doing a little pre-party.

489
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:26,450
Don't -- don't worry about this.
              Okay.

490
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:29,787
    Now, get a little dollop
       of some sour cream.

491
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:33,791
    Personally, I'm into, uh,
        some red onions.

492
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:35,860
          Oh, you know
     what I need back here?

493
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:41,465
     Let me get some chives.

494
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:43,167
              Okay.

495
00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:45,670
  Sprinkle those over the top.

496
00:21:45,672 --> 00:21:47,471
     And a little scallion.

497
00:21:55,715 --> 00:21:59,617
  Not showing off, just hungry.
              Okay.

498
00:21:59,619 --> 00:22:01,285
       Right on top there.

499
00:22:01,287 --> 00:22:02,453
           Excellent.

500
00:22:02,455 --> 00:22:05,256
 I get myself a couple crackers.

501
00:22:05,258 --> 00:22:06,724
       Drop 'em right on.

502
00:22:06,726 --> 00:22:09,060
    This is coming together.
       Now, look at that.

503
00:22:09,062 --> 00:22:11,362
  All that beautiful red color.

504
00:22:16,703 --> 00:22:17,835
    Mm. It's totally missing
          something --

505
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:20,404
      cheddar cheese sauce.

506
00:22:20,406 --> 00:22:23,040
       What am I thinking?
      This is the whole...

507
00:22:23,042 --> 00:22:25,242
        This is how I got
    the whole party started.

508
00:22:25,244 --> 00:22:27,778
          Look at that.

509
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:30,381
          There we go.

510
00:22:30,383 --> 00:22:35,920
  So sour cream, the scallions,
    the onions, the crackers

511
00:22:35,922 --> 00:22:39,957
  and this beautiful red chili
  that has no tomato or beans.

512
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:44,462
               Mm.

513
00:22:44,464 --> 00:22:46,430
       Deep, rich flavor.

514
00:22:46,432 --> 00:22:49,033
 Tighten it up just a little bit
         with that masa,

515
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:51,068
      that tortilla flour,
         right in there.

516
00:22:53,172 --> 00:22:54,538
               Mm.

517
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,940
      And the cheese sauce,
      man, I'm telling you,

518
00:22:55,942 --> 00:22:57,041
       you make that roux.

519
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:58,542
        Get a little bit
     of that half-and-half,

520
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:00,911
   but then stopped it and hit
 the rest of it with that beer,

521
00:23:00,913 --> 00:23:02,346
      with that nice little
           amber beer,

522
00:23:02,348 --> 00:23:05,416
      you're really getting
  that cheese to come through.

523
00:23:05,418 --> 00:23:07,852
               Mm.

524
00:23:07,854 --> 00:23:08,953
   And then, this right here.

525
00:23:08,955 --> 00:23:10,755
         I mean, I think
      you say potato skin,

526
00:23:10,757 --> 00:23:12,390
      people are expecting
  that I fill it with the chili

527
00:23:12,392 --> 00:23:13,891
           and hit it
     with the cheese sauce,

528
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:15,760
     which isn't a bad idea.
        But look at this.

529
00:23:15,762 --> 00:23:18,629
  Mushrooms, brie, prosciutto.

530
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:27,438
   A little kiss of the leeks
    in there, chives on top.

531
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,839
            Game day?

532
00:23:28,841 --> 00:23:30,641
   It looks like wedding food.
            Isn't it?

533
00:23:30,643 --> 00:23:31,742
Well, it depends on the wedding.

534
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:32,877
             Listen.
  You want to get this recipe?

535
00:23:32,879 --> 00:23:35,312
      'Cause I know you do.

536
00:23:35,314 --> 00:23:37,982
      You know the deal --
  foodnetwork.com/guysbigbite.

537
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:40,418
  Hanging out in the backyard,
   and I'll see you next week.

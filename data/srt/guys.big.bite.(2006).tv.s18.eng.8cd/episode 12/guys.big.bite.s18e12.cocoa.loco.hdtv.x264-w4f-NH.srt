1
00:00:16,751 --> 00:00:18,384
 You know, when you think about
     what you're gonna give

2
00:00:18,386 --> 00:00:21,653
 for Valentine's Day, everybody
    says you give chocolates.

3
00:00:21,655 --> 00:00:24,590
    But me, uh, I'm not much
    of a dessert, sweets guy.

4
00:00:24,592 --> 00:00:26,692
    So I don't know a box of
chocolates for me is gonna work.

5
00:00:26,694 --> 00:00:27,893
         But I do agree.

6
00:00:27,895 --> 00:00:30,162
    You gotta give chocolate
       on Valentine's Day.

7
00:00:30,164 --> 00:00:33,999
 So mine'll be inside of a dish.
        That's the idea,

8
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:36,602
        starting off with
 my grilled chicken mole negro.

9
00:00:36,604 --> 00:00:38,737
  Coated in a smoky chile rub,

10
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:40,939
       grilled and served
     with a dark mole sauce,

11
00:00:40,941 --> 00:00:43,475
         deeply flavored
with dried chiles and chocolate.

12
00:00:43,477 --> 00:00:45,677
       I mean, this makes
  the perfect Valentine's Day.

13
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:49,481
   Now I've also got a hominy
 with pomegranate and cilantro,

14
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:52,818
 fortified with black beans and
  a citrus tequila vinaigrette.

15
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,154
    So that's it. We got, uh,
     chicken and chocolate,

16
00:00:55,156 --> 00:00:56,922
       and we got tequila
       and salad dressing.

17
00:00:56,924 --> 00:00:58,824
     I know it sounds crazy,
       but, uh, trust me.

18
00:00:58,826 --> 00:01:01,126
     You're gonna love this.
     So stoking up the fire,

19
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:03,529
   getting it ready because we
  are gonna grill some chicken.

20
00:01:03,531 --> 00:01:05,230
          And the sauce
    that's gonna go with it,

21
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:07,066
      I'm not kidding you,
     is gonna knock you out.

22
00:01:07,068 --> 00:01:09,234
 So let's talk about this sauce.

23
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:11,203
Let's talk about this, uh, mole.

24
00:01:11,205 --> 00:01:14,506
  Now mole's kinda like sayin'
     to somebody, uh, "Yeah.

25
00:01:14,508 --> 00:01:15,908
       I've got a great --
     I've got a great salsa.

26
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:18,610
Or I got a great curry. Or I got
    a great barbecue sauce."

27
00:01:18,612 --> 00:01:20,245
  Moles are those kinda recipes

28
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:22,548
   that have been passed down
  through the family for years.

29
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:25,384
   So as I'm explaining this,
 I'm trying to open this pepper.

30
00:01:25,386 --> 00:01:27,086
         Um, what is it?

31
00:01:27,088 --> 00:01:28,520
       Well, there's a lot
   of different styles of it.

32
00:01:28,522 --> 00:01:29,688
  This is gonna be a dark mole.

33
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,356
         And typically,
   what would that have in it?

34
00:01:31,358 --> 00:01:32,624
            Exactly.
         Some chocolate.

35
00:01:32,626 --> 00:01:34,059
      So in this dark mole,

36
00:01:34,061 --> 00:01:37,096
   we're gonna start off here
   with a little ancho chile.

37
00:01:37,098 --> 00:01:40,766
   This was picked at its peak
    of ripeness, then dried.

38
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:43,635
      And you're gonna get
  this really nice, dark, rich,

39
00:01:43,637 --> 00:01:45,904
       almost like cherry
         and chocolate.

40
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:48,674
       I mean, fantastic.
 So we're gonna toast these off.

41
00:01:48,676 --> 00:01:52,244
       About four of each.

42
00:01:52,246 --> 00:01:53,946
           All right.
    So some of the anchos in.

43
00:01:53,948 --> 00:01:56,815
   Now let's get my favorite.
   This is the guajillo. Okay.

44
00:01:56,817 --> 00:01:58,750
        Take these seeds
          and stems out

45
00:01:58,752 --> 00:02:00,586
        because we don't
   want the stems particularly

46
00:02:00,588 --> 00:02:02,154
 or too many of the seeds 'cause

47
00:02:02,156 --> 00:02:04,957
       there's inherently
    gonna be a few in there.

48
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,125
         Tear these up.
         Toast 'em off.

49
00:02:06,127 --> 00:02:08,427
    I got some boiling water
     to reconstitute these.

50
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:11,096
      And they'll be going
         into this mole.

51
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:13,265
              Okay.
   So we'll drop all these in

52
00:02:13,267 --> 00:02:14,500
     and let that hang out.

53
00:02:14,502 --> 00:02:16,435
   And I'm -- Not raging heat.

54
00:02:16,437 --> 00:02:18,537
  You can just see it starting
     to smoke a little bit.

55
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:20,506
 And I'm touching it. And if you
   don't wanna do it that way,

56
00:02:20,508 --> 00:02:21,940
     just get the tongs out.

57
00:02:21,942 --> 00:02:23,375
          Just move 'em
      around a little bit.

58
00:02:23,377 --> 00:02:26,145
 Don't want 'em to burn, but we
   do want 'em to toast. Okay?

59
00:02:26,147 --> 00:02:27,646
    And they're almost there.

60
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:29,214
 You can see how they've really
      started to darken up.

61
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:32,284
 There was the original color --
     kind of a reddish hue.

62
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:34,453
   There's the toasted color.
  Okay? So we're almost there.

63
00:02:34,455 --> 00:02:36,188
Just about another minute or so.
           All right.

64
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,624
      While that's workin',
    let's talk about hominy.

65
00:02:38,626 --> 00:02:41,627
    Listen. I had this buddy
        when I was a kid,

66
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:43,295
    and he was such a hominy
            fanatic.

67
00:02:43,297 --> 00:02:45,264
 I had never had hominy before.
         Or maybe I had.

68
00:02:45,266 --> 00:02:47,566
   But he used to love hominy
   any way he could get it --

69
00:02:47,568 --> 00:02:48,834
   if he could get it cooked,

70
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:50,702
     if he could get it cold
           in a salad.

71
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:53,038
   And that was the first time
I think I really ever went, "Oh.

72
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,506
         Wait a second.
       I like this stuff."

73
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:55,874
    Now this is dried hominy.

74
00:02:55,876 --> 00:02:57,876
          If you can go
    from the dried corn and,

75
00:02:57,878 --> 00:02:59,111
     uh, cook 'em yourself,

76
00:02:59,113 --> 00:03:00,412
        you're just gonna
      get a better texture.

77
00:03:00,414 --> 00:03:02,981
   So these have been soakin'
       for about 24 hours.

78
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:04,917
        I'll dump it in.
  And this is going to make --

79
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:06,218
  I know this is gonna sound --

80
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,887
   We'll call it a slaw salsa.

81
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:11,657
          A slaw salsa.
  This is gonna be part salsa,

82
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:13,792
part salad, all from the hominy.

83
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:18,397
  I'll double the water on it.
          There we go.

84
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:20,365
   You're gonna let those cook
  till they're nice and tender.

85
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:22,868
      And speaking of nice
     and tender and cooking,

86
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,269
 that's just about enough there.

87
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:26,705
              'Kay.

88
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,674
 This is gonna -- You don't have
     to do it in a cast iron

89
00:03:28,676 --> 00:03:29,942
      if you don't want to.

90
00:03:29,944 --> 00:03:33,278
I like it because it's not gonna
         stain the pan.

91
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,047
   Uh, non-stick would not be
           your choice

92
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:38,150
     on this to toast these.

93
00:03:38,152 --> 00:03:40,419
       Just enough water.
      We'll let 'em steep.

94
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:43,422
   Matter of fact, I can even
  take 'em off the heat 'cause

95
00:03:43,424 --> 00:03:44,723
     the work has been done.

96
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,858
  That hot pan, that hot water,
       those hot chiles...

97
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,894
       They're gonna steep
    and get nice and pliable.

98
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:50,195
 We'll be able to work with 'em.
              Okay?

99
00:03:50,197 --> 00:03:52,197
      Let me get some heat
           under this.

100
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:58,570
         Uh, let's talk
       about the chicken.

101
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:02,708
           All right.

102
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:07,512
   The key here is free-range.

103
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:09,414
    I'm a big fan of chicken.

104
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:12,284
I'm a big fan of anything that's
  in that free-range attitude.

105
00:04:12,286 --> 00:04:14,386
  No hormones, no antibiotics.

106
00:04:14,388 --> 00:04:15,854
         The great thing
   about a free-range chicken

107
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:18,657
      is it's had a chance
to not live in a cage but go out

108
00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:20,926
   and work and be a chicken,
           all right?

109
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:22,527
          And build --
     And there's something.

110
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:24,830
 I mean, that just does flavor.
  You got that chicken moving.

111
00:04:24,832 --> 00:04:26,665
      You got that chicken
    finding things, foraging.

112
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:28,500
    There's just gotta be --
      Well, that all works

113
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:30,202
      into the development
  of the flavor of the chicken.

114
00:04:30,204 --> 00:04:31,903
        So my butcher --
  gotta have a good butcher --

115
00:04:31,905 --> 00:04:34,406
     ...broke it down to me
       into eight pieces.

116
00:04:34,408 --> 00:04:36,375
          Look at that.

117
00:04:36,377 --> 00:04:39,177
     Eight beautiful pieces,
        no feet included.

118
00:04:39,179 --> 00:04:40,879
      And we're gonna make
    a little dry rub for it.

119
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:42,381
      So let me get a bowl.

120
00:04:42,383 --> 00:04:44,516
      Got a nice fire going
  with some briquette charcoal,

121
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:46,551
  some lump charcoal and then I
     threw on some hard oak.

122
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:48,220
     Wanna get a little bit
          of that smoky

123
00:04:48,222 --> 00:04:49,621
  wood flavor coming into this.

124
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:52,591
       So we'll start off
  with just a touch of cayenne,

125
00:04:52,593 --> 00:04:54,793
  little cracked black pepper,

126
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:57,496
    little more kosher salt,

127
00:04:57,498 --> 00:05:01,099
       granulated garlic,

128
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:03,201
        a little chipotle
         chile powder...

129
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:07,606
  a little ancho chile powder.

130
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:10,475
          There we go.

131
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:11,777
           The cumin.

132
00:05:14,214 --> 00:05:17,082
     Okay. Now that chipotle
   and the ancho, why the two?

133
00:05:17,084 --> 00:05:19,751
  Looking for a little bit more
 heat coming from that chipotle.

134
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:21,653
 You had the cayenne. Of course
     that's really big heat.

135
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:24,589
 Then we'll go to the chipotle,
         then the ancho.

136
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:27,059
     All right. Mix this up.

137
00:05:27,061 --> 00:05:29,194
    And what I'm gonna do --

138
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:31,663
    And this really goes back
   to the old-school methods.

139
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,732
      I'm gonna season this
          ahead of time

140
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:36,635
   and just let this sit here
for a second out on the counter.

141
00:05:36,637 --> 00:05:40,205
            Remember,
    this is all the bone in.

142
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:43,508
   We'll get some great color
        out of this rub.

143
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,444
          Look at that.

144
00:05:45,446 --> 00:05:47,379
       Great way to start
      this whole thing off.

145
00:05:47,381 --> 00:05:49,147
    Now you can get the whole
        chicken yourself

146
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:50,248
       and break it down.

147
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,351
    But this just gets right
          to the point.

148
00:05:52,353 --> 00:05:56,054
     Give this a little rub,
          little flip.

149
00:05:56,056 --> 00:05:57,856
         Okay. One more.

150
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,391
         And then enough
     to get the other side.

151
00:05:59,393 --> 00:06:00,659
   So here's what's happenin'.

152
00:06:00,661 --> 00:06:03,829
           We're, um,
sharing our Valentine's Day love

153
00:06:03,831 --> 00:06:05,030
    with a little chocolate.

154
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:06,264
  It's just gonna happen to be

155
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:08,767
        in a dish served
   over some chicken with, uh,

156
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:10,836
      a funky hominy slaw.

157
00:06:10,838 --> 00:06:13,004
   Oh, you're gonna love this.
     Write it down for sure.

158
00:06:13,006 --> 00:06:14,840
       See ya in a minute.

159
00:06:22,116 --> 00:06:25,117
 You know, I wish I had an intro
 song coming back in to like...

160
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:28,954
You know, something like that.

161
00:06:28,956 --> 00:06:30,288
           Do you guys
     have a song like that?

162
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,790
    Would you send it my way?
      I'd love to see that.

163
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:34,393
          Well, welcome
      to "Guy's Big Bite."

164
00:06:34,395 --> 00:06:36,061
      We're still back here
       in the kitchen, uh,

165
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:38,563
     making Valentine's Day
           happiness.

166
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:40,732
Uh, yes, there will be chocolate
     coming into this dish.

167
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,267
     I do not put chocolate
           in the box.

168
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:44,469
    That's just not my style.
      So what am I making?

169
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:46,371
  I'm making some fantastic --
         Well, not yet.

170
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:49,141
          But it'll be
  a grilled chicken mole negro.

171
00:06:49,143 --> 00:06:52,744
   So busting down some onions
 right now for this mole sauce.

172
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,813
And I have some peppers steeping
           over here.

173
00:06:54,815 --> 00:06:56,415
    Got some ancho in there,
         which is gonna

174
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:59,484
  give some really nice, deep,
  rich tones of pepper and then

175
00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:01,153
 a little bit of that spiciness
         coming through

176
00:07:01,155 --> 00:07:02,521
       from the guajillo.

177
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:04,423
       I toasted those off
       just a second ago.

178
00:07:04,425 --> 00:07:05,991
      Now they're steeping
        in the hot water.

179
00:07:05,993 --> 00:07:08,827
          There we go.
        Some onions done.

180
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:11,463
     Let me pop a little bit
           of garlic,

181
00:07:11,465 --> 00:07:13,398
  give this a quick little dice

182
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,066
   and into the food processor
            we'll go.

183
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:16,601
  And this is where we're gonna
       start the beginning

184
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:18,103
       of this, uh, mole.

185
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:21,373
   Now as I said, moles, well,
everybody's got a recipe for it.

186
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:23,642
   Or a lot of, uh, you know,
   a lot of my Latino friends,

187
00:07:23,644 --> 00:07:25,043
      their family has it.

188
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:27,212
   And so trying to get one of
       these from somebody

189
00:07:27,214 --> 00:07:29,748
      is kinda like trying
    to get the family secret.

190
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,983
      Um, let me see here.

191
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:34,252
          This is hot.

192
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:35,954
          There we go.
              Okay.

193
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:42,160
     So we want the peppers
 and about a cup of the liquid.

194
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:44,229
              Okay.
   Little bit of that pepper,

195
00:07:44,231 --> 00:07:46,898
         steeping water.

196
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,834
          I'll just go
    over the old-school way.

197
00:07:48,836 --> 00:07:50,735
   I'm in the outdoor kitchen.
   I can drag it over the top

198
00:07:50,737 --> 00:07:51,736
         of everything.

199
00:07:51,738 --> 00:07:53,672
    So we get the onions in.

200
00:07:53,674 --> 00:07:56,074
     Now comes a whole host
        of ingredients --

201
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:58,009
    Mexican oregano, cloves,

202
00:07:58,011 --> 00:08:00,412
   cinnamon and sesame seeds.
            Oh, yeah.

203
00:08:00,414 --> 00:08:02,180
      Toasted sesame seeds.
           Absolutely.

204
00:08:02,182 --> 00:08:04,182
 There's gonna be some more nuts
    in this in just a second.

205
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:06,251
   Little toasted sesame seed.

206
00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:07,619
        Mexican oregano.

207
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:09,387
    You hear me talk about it
   on "Big Bite" all the time.

208
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:11,723
    Big, big oregano flavor.

209
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:13,158
          And we'll do
     a little ground clove.

210
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,594
      This is just a touch.

211
00:08:15,596 --> 00:08:17,128
          There we go.

212
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,563
 Just a touch of some cinnamon.
              Yes.

213
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:20,098
 And it does have those tones --

214
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,934
          the cinnamon,
    the chocolate, the sugar.

215
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:25,003
              Okay.
          There we go.

216
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:27,506
      Now these are the two
           ingredients

217
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:29,875
   that you're probably gonna
  look at me and say, "Really?

218
00:08:29,877 --> 00:08:30,909
       That's in a mole?"

219
00:08:30,911 --> 00:08:34,613
  And it's going to be, uh-huh,

220
00:08:34,615 --> 00:08:36,915
  slivered almonds and raisins.

221
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:38,383
             I know.
             I know.

222
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:39,518
   Don't shoot the messenger.

223
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,685
   But you're gonna dig this.

224
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:42,387
  So we'll get in some raisins.

225
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:45,023
      And that -- You know,
    raisins have that real --

226
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:49,995
 that distinct, sweet, um, like,

227
00:08:49,997 --> 00:08:52,831
  like, dark brown sugar kinda
         flavor to 'em.

228
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,399
         That's why they
     play into this so well.

229
00:08:54,401 --> 00:08:59,671
 And then the almonds'll create
 some really nice texture to it.

230
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:01,673
    And again, you're wanting
to think, "Where was this made?"

231
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:02,908
       We're talking about
         down in Mexico.

232
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:03,975
          We're talkin'
     about what ingredients,

233
00:09:03,977 --> 00:09:06,044
 what was available down there.

234
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:07,379
           Dried nuts
    definitely play into it.

235
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:09,381
              Okay.
       This is the one --

236
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:11,917
  this is the one that's gonna
     take some explanation.

237
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:13,485
      This is brown sugar.

238
00:09:13,487 --> 00:09:16,354
        The Mexican sugar
 that looks like it's in a cone.

239
00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:17,789
     And this is unrefined.

240
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:20,058
   So this isn't a white sugar
   with molasses added to it.

241
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,960
      This is an unrefined
          Mexican sugar

242
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:25,664
  that has a really nice, rich
molasses smell and flavor to it.

243
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,799
   And it's called piloncillo.

244
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:32,671
          There we go.

245
00:09:32,673 --> 00:09:34,839
         Just depends on
      how dried out it got.

246
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:36,975
              Okay.
       All that together.

247
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:40,111
 And one last thing -- a little
      bit of chicken stock.

248
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:43,181
      Let me get my heat up
       on this Dutch oven.

249
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:44,282
       Why the Dutch oven?
              Okay.

250
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:45,784
 That's a really good question.

251
00:09:45,786 --> 00:09:47,519
   The Dutch oven because you
     gotta think about this.

252
00:09:47,521 --> 00:09:50,021
         We got some --
we got some sweet going into it.

253
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:52,190
     We even have more sweet
         going into it.

254
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:53,491
        And this is gonna
        go low and slow.

255
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:55,460
        And nothing worse
     than going low and slow

256
00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:57,429
     and burning it because
you're not keeping an eye on it.

257
00:09:57,431 --> 00:09:59,931
    So these old Dutch ovens,
    that was kind of the, uh,

258
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:03,068
            the idea
  is to have enough insulation

259
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:05,804
   that it wasn't gonna burn,
              okay?

260
00:10:05,806 --> 00:10:07,372
This...

261
00:10:07,374 --> 00:10:09,240
   Eh, it comes out the sides.

262
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:12,978
     Don't worry about that.
      Clean that up later.

263
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,479
It's a really nice look, though.

264
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,751
Awesome.

265
00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:21,186
          There we go.

266
00:10:21,188 --> 00:10:22,754
           All right.
         You know what?

267
00:10:22,756 --> 00:10:25,290
I gotta set this down 'cause I'm
 forgetting one key ingredient.

268
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:27,058
     Let's talk about lard.

269
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,193
           Now lard --
         What are we t--

270
00:10:28,195 --> 00:10:30,362
         So -- So here's
      some pig fat for ya.

271
00:10:30,364 --> 00:10:32,364
      Now here's something
    you're not gonna believe.

272
00:10:32,366 --> 00:10:35,367
   If I told you that this had
 less saturated fat than butter,

273
00:10:35,369 --> 00:10:36,534
      would you believe me?

274
00:10:36,536 --> 00:10:38,069
     Well, you should 'cause
          it's my show.

275
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:39,938
   I'm telling you the truth.
        Less than butter.

276
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,573
      And here's the beauty
           about this.

277
00:10:41,575 --> 00:10:43,241
        This right here,
  we're talking tons of flavor.

278
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:45,744
 Now this isn't just bacon fat.
    That's not what this is.

279
00:10:45,746 --> 00:10:47,812
     This doesn't have a lot
        of flavor to it.

280
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:50,615
In the Latin world of food, what
  were they using to cook with?

281
00:10:50,617 --> 00:10:52,550
    Well, pigs are abundant.
      They're sustainable.

282
00:10:52,552 --> 00:10:54,619
  The Italians and the Greeks,
      we had the olive oil.

283
00:10:54,621 --> 00:10:56,388
         And the French,
      you have the butter.

284
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:59,057
        Well, in Mexico,
      you got the pig fat.

285
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:01,693
           All right.
       So that cooks down.

286
00:11:01,695 --> 00:11:04,396
  It's gonna bubble just a bit.

287
00:11:04,398 --> 00:11:05,697
          There we go.

288
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:07,032
            Awesome.

289
00:11:07,034 --> 00:11:08,466
              Okay.

290
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:09,868
    Give this a little stir.
               Oh!

291
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,336
  You should smell the flavors
      right off the bat --

292
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:14,372
    raisins, sugar, cinnamon,
  nutmeg coming right through.

293
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:16,007
        But don't worry.
    This is not a sweet dish.

294
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,308
         This is savory.

295
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,410
              Okay.

296
00:11:18,412 --> 00:11:20,045
           Done there.

297
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:22,981
 Now let's get the chicken down.
   Uh, mole... I'm telling ya.

298
00:11:22,983 --> 00:11:24,849
      So many ingredients,
    I gotta remember 'em all.

299
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:27,185
      Look at the chicken.
  Made a nice, little dry rub.

300
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:30,622
       We've got some salt
     and pepper, of course.

301
00:11:30,624 --> 00:11:32,490
         Then we've got
    a little chipotle powder,

302
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:36,194
   little ancho chile powder,
  little cayenne, little cumin,

303
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:37,896
           of course.

304
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:39,664
          Look at this.
            Bone in.

305
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,533
       Nice, big bird too.

306
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:44,102
             I mean,
 that is a real-deal-size bird.

307
00:11:44,104 --> 00:11:45,603
     So what I'm gonna do is
        let this get hot.

308
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:48,073
  I've already oiled the grate,
 flip it over, charred the skin.

309
00:11:48,075 --> 00:11:50,108
 But this -- See, a lot of times
    you wanna see the chicken

310
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:52,644
  go into the mole, and that's
   how it would cook together.

311
00:11:52,646 --> 00:11:54,646
     Me, I want a little bit
         of this crust,

312
00:11:54,648 --> 00:11:56,014
   a little bit of this char,

313
00:11:56,016 --> 00:11:58,316
        a little more of
  this California-style to it.

314
00:11:58,318 --> 00:11:59,651
   So we'll grill the chicken,

315
00:11:59,653 --> 00:12:01,653
           get it done
    and add it with the mole.

316
00:12:01,655 --> 00:12:04,556
    So here's the last thing
      I got -- the hominy.

317
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:05,990
      I haven't even talked
           about that.

318
00:12:05,992 --> 00:12:09,027
     Oh. It is gonna be this
       hominy slaw salsa.

319
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:11,529
  Beans are gonna go in there.
  Pomegranate's going in there.

320
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:14,733
    So what I've gotta do --
  Look. We're just about done.

321
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:16,468
         Check that out.

322
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,703
        I'll drain this,
    drain and wash my beans.

323
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:20,371
         You come back.
 We'll keep putting it together.

324
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:21,740
     And I gotta keep an eye
          on the mole.

325
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:23,708
So I'll see you in a little bit.
               Mm.

326
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:32,350
       Huh? Look at that.

327
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:34,018
      Steaming hot hominy.

328
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,286
   Don't hear that every day.

329
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:36,988
      Oh, that's fantastic.

330
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:39,190
     We're doing this whole
         Valentine's Day

331
00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:40,291
     cookin' with chocolate.

332
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:41,726
         But I say mole,

333
00:12:41,728 --> 00:12:43,728
       and I think hominy.
        I don't know why.

334
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,930
      But talking of mole,
          look at this.

335
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:50,435
    A beautiful, deep, dark,
    rich mole that's gonna go

336
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:52,137
    with this grilled chicken
     that I have over here.

337
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:55,907
 Really nice, um, Mexican theme
        going to it. Oh.

338
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:59,611
    We've got everything from
 slivered almonds, brown sugar,

339
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:04,282
   raisins, spices, guajillo,
 ancho chiles in there, onions,

340
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:05,617
 garlic, a little chicken stock.

341
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:07,118
   Speaking of chicken stock,
          I need to get

342
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,787
   a little bit more in there.

343
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:10,655
 Just getting a touch too thick.

344
00:13:10,657 --> 00:13:12,423
     And I'm trying to keep
         that heat down.

345
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:14,392
       And what's the star
        of a great mole?

346
00:13:14,394 --> 00:13:17,262
            Exactly.
       A little chocolate.

347
00:13:17,264 --> 00:13:20,431
           Now this is
   the Mexican-style chocolate

348
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:23,501
   you'll find in the markets.

349
00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:26,838
     What I'm gonna do is...

350
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,606
 I'm gonna try to break it here
       if I don't break --

351
00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:30,008
          There we go.

352
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:32,010
     That and...there we go.

353
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,747
     Give it a little grate.
     But I'll ya something.

354
00:13:35,749 --> 00:13:39,017
     As much time as this is
    gonna spend here working,

355
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:40,952
         I'm just gonna
    throw the whole thing in.

356
00:13:40,954 --> 00:13:44,088
But I'll do this just so I kinda
    follow some of the rules.

357
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:46,324
      Hey. Look over there.
              Okay.

358
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,927
      You were gonna do it
         anyways, right?

359
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:51,296
  So that chocolate's not just
       regular chocolate.

360
00:13:51,298 --> 00:13:52,564
     It's not overly sweet.

361
00:13:52,566 --> 00:13:54,199
 But it's got a little bit of a,

362
00:13:54,201 --> 00:13:55,733
              like,
  a little cinnamon undertone,

363
00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:56,968
      little nutmeg to it.

364
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:58,503
 So we'll let this just sit here
         and cook down.

365
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:01,906
 And again, with time, this just
    becomes really luxurious.

366
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:03,575
  Remember, we got a little bit
           of manteca,

367
00:14:03,577 --> 00:14:05,276
    we got a little pork fat
            in there.

368
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:06,678
           Fantastic.
              Okay.

369
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,314
         Hominy's done.
        Beans are rinsed.

370
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:10,949
  Let's get into some chicken.

371
00:14:10,951 --> 00:14:13,384
        Now this chicken
    has a nice dry rub on it.

372
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:16,120
   And it's a free-range bird.

373
00:14:16,122 --> 00:14:18,189
      Big, beautiful breast
          right there.

374
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:21,359
        Skin on, bone in,
      all kinds of flavor.

375
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:27,165
  And we got the wings as well.

376
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:28,900
    So we'll throw this right
          into the oven

377
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:31,469
    right around 350 degrees.

378
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:32,904
              Okay?

379
00:14:32,906 --> 00:14:34,405
Tuck it right around the corner.

380
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:35,740
             Voilà.

381
00:14:35,742 --> 00:14:38,276
          Okay. Hominy.

382
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:39,577
              Okay.
   Let's get into the hominy.

383
00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:41,079
         Let me get rid
       of this chocolate.

384
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:42,347
            Let's --
     I did a little zesting.

385
00:14:42,349 --> 00:14:43,815
       And this is always
   such a boring part of this,

386
00:14:43,817 --> 00:14:45,483
      but it's so critical,

387
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:48,086
 because if you wanna really get
   that awesome citrus flavor,

388
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:50,822
          you're gonna
   have to do a little zesting

389
00:14:50,824 --> 00:14:52,323
 without getting all that acid.

390
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:56,728
 So first we'll go in with lime
        and orange zest.

391
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,363
        And this is gonna
     be this dressing for --

392
00:14:58,365 --> 00:15:00,698
     What should I call it?
      I called it a slaw --

393
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,966
           slaw salsa?

394
00:15:01,968 --> 00:15:03,201
  Something along those lines.

395
00:15:03,203 --> 00:15:04,736
   That's exactly what it is.

396
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:07,639
   It's part slaw, part salsa
 because we're using the hominy,

397
00:15:07,641 --> 00:15:09,374
 but we're also using the beans.

398
00:15:09,376 --> 00:15:11,643
   So these are all gonna come
            together.

399
00:15:11,645 --> 00:15:13,478
    And I'll show you the key
  ingredient here in a second,

400
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,812
  which you're gonna love this.

401
00:15:14,814 --> 00:15:16,180
     'Cause you're thinking
        Valentine's Day.

402
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:17,715
            Of course
    you're thinking tequila.

403
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:20,218
      Little bit of juice.

404
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,886
       Lime juice in here.

405
00:15:27,193 --> 00:15:30,028
              Okay.
       So the juice is in.

406
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:33,298
       How about a little
        red chile flake?

407
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,700
      Touch of some cumin.

408
00:15:35,702 --> 00:15:37,235
    Now we got acid in here.

409
00:15:37,237 --> 00:15:38,603
  We got a little bit of spice.

410
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:40,672
      What do we need next?
   going with a little agave.

411
00:15:40,674 --> 00:15:43,274
      So a little sweetness
          of the agave.

412
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:44,575
         You know what?
        Valentine's Day.

413
00:15:44,577 --> 00:15:46,844
         Eh -- tequila.
        We need tequila.

414
00:15:46,846 --> 00:15:48,780
 I think that says -- that's --

415
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:51,582
    Nothing says "I love you"
     like a little tequila.

416
00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:53,685
        There's something
      about the combination

417
00:15:53,687 --> 00:15:56,554
   of tequila, lime and agave.

418
00:15:56,556 --> 00:15:58,256
       A little sweetness,
        a little tequila

419
00:15:58,258 --> 00:15:59,791
      and a little lime...

420
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:01,993
      Uh, I think they call
        that a margarita.

421
00:16:01,995 --> 00:16:04,729
  So when you're almost making
      a margarita dressing,

422
00:16:04,731 --> 00:16:06,564
          it just kinda
   triggers a natural memory.

423
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:09,200
    So -- and it works great.
     And it's not overdone.

424
00:16:09,202 --> 00:16:10,969
  But it's that little bite of
   that tequila, a little bit

425
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:12,937
    of that fresh lime juice
 and a little bit of that agave

426
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:14,505
   that works so well together
           in a drink,

427
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:15,907
   work perfect in a dressing.

428
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:19,877
               Oh.
 I'm gonna tell ya something --

429
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:21,346
    The zest does everything.

430
00:16:21,348 --> 00:16:24,349
          One last key,
     super-key ingredient --

431
00:16:24,351 --> 00:16:27,185
      It's the pomegranate.
       I went to Croatia.

432
00:16:27,187 --> 00:16:30,355
     I saw pomegranate trees
       growing everywhere.

433
00:16:30,357 --> 00:16:31,656
 And I will tell ya something --

434
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:33,591
     I've always been a fan
        of pomegranates.

435
00:16:33,593 --> 00:16:34,759
 I didn't know exactly what they

436
00:16:34,761 --> 00:16:36,327
    looked like on the tree,
     but they were awesome.

437
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:39,430
  So here's my little technique
 to get these pomegranates out.

438
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:41,466
         Just take 'em.
I think everybody uses this one.

439
00:16:41,468 --> 00:16:43,201
  Hit it with the wooden spoon.

440
00:16:43,203 --> 00:16:44,402
         Knock 'em out.
           That's it.

441
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:47,071
   So I'm gonna add the beans,
         uh, the hominy.

442
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:49,040
    You got the pomegranates.
          Mole's done.

443
00:16:49,042 --> 00:16:50,641
  Gotta fix the chicken 'cause
       it's gonna burn up.

444
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:52,176
And you come back, and I'm gonna
       put it all together

445
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:53,478
       on a nice platter.

446
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,547
   It's gonna look fantastic.
        See ya in a bit.

447
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:02,053
          Welcome back.
           All right.

448
00:17:02,055 --> 00:17:03,521
       So I'm just puttin'
       this all together.

449
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:05,056
         Still thinkin'
     about that theme song.

450
00:17:05,058 --> 00:17:07,925
       I'm thinking maybe
        some soft piano.

451
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:10,228
      Not s-- No, I agree.
       Not so much. Okay.

452
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:13,998
        So some cilantro
        and some onions,

453
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,466
   some scallions ready to go.

454
00:17:15,468 --> 00:17:17,869
  Chicken is just finishing up
          in the oven.

455
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:19,771
        Let's grab this.
       I had to cover it.

456
00:17:19,773 --> 00:17:21,305
       You know, sometimes
     with a wood-fired oven,

457
00:17:21,307 --> 00:17:22,840
    things get a little crazy
            in here.

458
00:17:22,842 --> 00:17:26,744
     And, uh, well worth it
  because take a look at that.

459
00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:28,613
            Gorgeous.
            Gorgeous.

460
00:17:28,615 --> 00:17:30,448
            Gorgeous.

461
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:32,016
          There we go.

462
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:33,885
         Bring it over.

463
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:35,620
    Now the mole sauce -- Oh!

464
00:17:35,622 --> 00:17:37,722
       This is -- I mean,
 this is really coming together.

465
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:39,590
    Nothing says "I love you"
           like mole.

466
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:41,225
       Well, I don't know.
     You put that in a box,

467
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:42,860
 someone would be really, really
 scared what you're giving them.

468
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:44,095
   But here's what we've got.

469
00:17:44,097 --> 00:17:46,164
     It's really cooked down
         nice and silky.

470
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:47,965
  We've got chocolate in there.

471
00:17:47,967 --> 00:17:51,702
         We've got, uh,
some ancho chile, some chipotle,

472
00:17:51,704 --> 00:17:54,305
    a little guajillo pepper,
        almonds, raisins.

473
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:55,807
       Oh, the raisins --
        I'm telling you,

474
00:17:55,809 --> 00:17:57,408
 that's one of my favorite parts
            about it.

475
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,643
              Okay.

476
00:17:58,645 --> 00:18:00,978
   Now let's drop this chicken
         right on here.

477
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,881
          Look at that.

478
00:18:03,883 --> 00:18:06,517
    Nestle it right in there.

479
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:07,852
      Beautiful, isn't it?

480
00:18:07,854 --> 00:18:12,056
         And the chicken
     has a dry rub on it --

481
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:13,224
   salt and pepper, of course,

482
00:18:13,226 --> 00:18:16,828
          little cumin,
     little chipotle powder.

483
00:18:18,865 --> 00:18:20,198
          Right inside.
       What do you think?

484
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,999
     And I'm just gonna give
  these all just a little kiss

485
00:18:22,001 --> 00:18:24,068
         of some sauce.

486
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,937
      Oh. This is gorgeous.

487
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:27,338
    This is -- Well, they say
     you're supposed to give

488
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,739
 chocolate for Valentine's Day.

489
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:30,341
          I'm doing it.
       I'm just giving it

490
00:18:30,343 --> 00:18:32,743
        a different form
   than you'd usually expect.

491
00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:35,246
              Okay.
    This guy on top of that.

492
00:18:35,248 --> 00:18:36,747
          Look at that.
      Isn't that beautiful?

493
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:38,182
       And you know what?
  This is kind of a quick mole.

494
00:18:38,184 --> 00:18:40,318
    I'll be honest with you.
   This one'll go pretty fast.

495
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,420
           You can get
 this done in 45 minutes or so.

496
00:18:42,422 --> 00:18:46,090
         But not to say
that it lacks in flavor one bit.

497
00:18:46,092 --> 00:18:47,925
    All right. There we are.

498
00:18:47,927 --> 00:18:49,527
  Let me get this outta my way.

499
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:53,998
   And let's get to this slaw,
        this slaw salsa.

500
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,069
      Now drain the beans,
          black beans.

501
00:18:58,071 --> 00:18:59,570
         Check this out.

502
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:01,405
    Got a little pomegranate
 in there, a little orange zest,

503
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:02,673
       a little lime zest,

504
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:05,877
         tequila, agave,
     a little bit of cumin.

505
00:19:05,879 --> 00:19:07,478
        The beans go in.

506
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,380
          The hominy --
     Started this from dry.

507
00:19:09,382 --> 00:19:11,749
     Boiled it a little bit.
       Little bit of salt.

508
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:15,186
          It's tender,
      but it's got texture.

509
00:19:15,188 --> 00:19:16,287
          Drop that in.

510
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:18,222
       Grab a little more
        of the cilantro.

511
00:19:18,224 --> 00:19:22,860
   Just kinda give it a little
   rough tear right into that.

512
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:24,929
               Mm.
     And this vinaigrette --

513
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:27,532
        I mean, come on.
       Look at the beans.

514
00:19:27,534 --> 00:19:29,800
      Look at the beautiful
           pomegranate

515
00:19:29,802 --> 00:19:31,235
      just poppin' through.

516
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:35,239
       Touch of some salt.

517
00:19:35,241 --> 00:19:37,074
   And you know what the great
      thing about this is?

518
00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:38,643
      Is this is gonna eat
          like a salsa.

519
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:39,977
    It goes right alongside.

520
00:19:39,979 --> 00:19:42,079
   But then it's nice and rich
    with the beans in there,

521
00:19:42,081 --> 00:19:44,649
   so it'll be kind of a salad
       alongside of that.

522
00:19:44,651 --> 00:19:46,851
               Oh.

523
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:48,653
    Gotta get a bite of this.

524
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:55,393
   Tender beans, little snap,

525
00:19:55,395 --> 00:19:57,995
      just a little pop of
        that pomegranate,

526
00:19:57,997 --> 00:20:02,967
the big chew coming through from
  that hominy, the vinaigrette,

527
00:20:02,969 --> 00:20:05,269
       the tequila shining
  right through, little agave,

528
00:20:05,271 --> 00:20:06,904
  little kiss of the sweetness.

529
00:20:06,906 --> 00:20:08,472
       I gotta serve this
        all up for my mom

530
00:20:08,474 --> 00:20:09,874
  and for Lori, get this ready.

531
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:12,043
    But I'm just going to --
           All right.

532
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:14,245
   For responsibility's sake,
         I need to just,

533
00:20:14,247 --> 00:20:15,846
you know, kinda break into this.

534
00:20:15,848 --> 00:20:17,648
    I mean, I'm not having --
  I'm not eating ahead of time.

535
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:20,718
I just wanna make sure that Lori
and my mom are getting the best.

536
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,286
       Don't tell anybody.

537
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:27,525
       Oh! That's exactly
      what I wanted to do!

538
00:20:27,527 --> 00:20:28,793
       Grill the chicken,

539
00:20:28,795 --> 00:20:32,663
    give it its own texture,
        its own identity,

540
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:34,065
 and then add that awesome mole.

541
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:36,567
          So many times
    you'll find that chicken

542
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,436
      cooked in the sauce.

543
00:20:38,438 --> 00:20:39,971
           It's great.

1
00:00:01,102 --> 00:00:02,134
         Hey, everybody.

2
00:00:02,136 --> 00:00:03,602
         I'm Guy Fieri,
      and we're rolling out

3
00:00:03,604 --> 00:00:07,072
 looking for America's greatest
  diners, drive-ins, and dives.

4
00:00:07,074 --> 00:00:08,440
          This trip...
                     Ta-da!

5
00:00:08,442 --> 00:00:10,442
       ...we're gearing up
   for some global greatness.

6
00:00:10,444 --> 00:00:12,277
That rocks the house.

7
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:14,213
        Like a legendary
       Los Angeles spot...

8
00:00:14,215 --> 00:00:16,015
                It's exactly
         what I wanted it to be.

9
00:00:16,017 --> 00:00:18,417
       ...definitely doing
       Italian their way.

10
00:00:18,419 --> 00:00:21,053
          I have done some weird
          lasagna making before,

11
00:00:21,055 --> 00:00:22,621
             but this is taking
                  the cake.

12
00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:24,590
         ...and a money
      Minneapolis joint...

13
00:00:24,592 --> 00:00:25,724
              Wait, wait, wait,
              wait, wait, wait.

14
00:00:25,726 --> 00:00:28,227
     ...making mouthwatering
         Middle Eastern.

15
00:00:28,229 --> 00:00:29,895
   I've had a lot of good hummus
                 in my life

16
00:00:29,897 --> 00:00:32,231
     but I haven't had very much
          hummus this fantastic.

17
00:00:32,233 --> 00:00:33,699
        And in Hawaii...

18
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:35,534
Feel free to put as much
on there as you want.

19
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:36,602
   All of it baby.

20
00:00:36,604 --> 00:00:39,238
        ...sushi so fresh
      it practically swims.

21
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,739
I'm gonna hold the plate,

22
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:44,009
  you put the rest
 of it in my mouth.

23
00:00:44,011 --> 00:00:46,045
     That's all right here,
           right now,

24
00:00:46,047 --> 00:00:48,447
 on "Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives."

25
00:00:48,449 --> 00:00:50,449
                     ♪

26
00:01:01,095 --> 00:01:02,594
         So I'm here in
    the San Fernando Valley,

27
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:04,530
       just a few minutes
     away from Studio City,

28
00:01:04,532 --> 00:01:06,532
      to check out a joint.
   And you'll love the story.

29
00:01:06,534 --> 00:01:09,234
    I'm in this area shooting
 "Minute To Win It," years ago.

30
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:11,036
       And I'm looking for
    some great Italian food.

31
00:01:11,038 --> 00:01:12,304
 And I get this recommendation.

32
00:01:12,306 --> 00:01:14,406
       So I drive around,
         I drive around,

33
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:16,041
   and I can't find the place.

34
00:01:16,043 --> 00:01:17,876
       Uh, that's because
     there was a little bit

35
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:19,278
    of a mix-up on the name.

36
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,647
       It's not "Varone's"
       it's "Barone's" --

37
00:01:21,649 --> 00:01:25,751
   famous Italian restaurant.

38
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:28,720
 All right, guys --
Margherita Pizza ready to go!

39
00:01:28,722 --> 00:01:31,423
                Unbelievable.
       Just off-the-charts good.

40
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:33,892
Here is your Tres Cannellonis,
   sir. Enjoy, eh?

41
00:01:33,894 --> 00:01:36,562
                 The aura is
        so old-school it's real.

42
00:01:36,564 --> 00:01:39,331
     That's 'cause it's been
     in business since 1945.

43
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:41,900
       Starting with owner
    Tom Monteleone's uncles,

44
00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:43,368
          then his dad.

45
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:44,837
     When my father passed,

46
00:01:44,839 --> 00:01:47,506
   he says to me "You're gonna
   carry on the legacy, here."

47
00:01:47,508 --> 00:01:49,041
    Fieri: No problem there.

48
00:01:49,043 --> 00:01:51,243
       They did move from
     the original location,

49
00:01:51,245 --> 00:01:53,145
       to this old German
         hofbrau house.

50
00:01:53,147 --> 00:01:56,181
 But the classic Italian flavors
        remain the same.

51
00:01:56,183 --> 00:01:59,218
   And Tom's daughter Laura is
    working to take it over.

52
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,386
   10 more minutes
 on the house combo.

53
00:02:01,388 --> 00:02:03,922
      First time I came in,
 I had the pizza, I flipped out.

54
00:02:03,924 --> 00:02:04,990
It's definitely different

55
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:06,625
from any other pizza
   I've ever had.

56
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:08,327
I really like the crust.

57
00:02:08,329 --> 00:02:11,663
So, my favorite thing
 is the pizza crust.

58
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:13,365
      [ Sighs ]

59
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:14,533
 Just take a moment.

60
00:02:14,535 --> 00:02:15,400
                [ Chuckles ]

61
00:02:15,402 --> 00:02:16,835
   Let's make it.

62
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:18,504
         All right. White flour.

63
00:02:18,506 --> 00:02:19,271
  Developed yeast?

64
00:02:19,273 --> 00:02:20,239
                    Yep.

65
00:02:20,241 --> 00:02:21,206
That's a lot of olive oil.

66
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:22,608
             More flavor, right?

67
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:23,375
   No, that's key.

68
00:02:23,377 --> 00:02:24,276
                 Warm water.

69
00:02:24,278 --> 00:02:25,410
   Oh, this works.

70
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:27,846
               We'll proof it
                for 24 hours.

71
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:30,949
That's where that big,
yeasty flavor is developing.

72
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:33,819
            Now we're making our
        house combination pizza.

73
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:35,787
       We're gonna brush the pan
               with olive oil,

74
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:37,289
               grab a portion
               of the dough --

75
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:38,724
So it gets sheeted out.

76
00:02:38,726 --> 00:02:41,093
              Flatten the dough
              around the edges.

77
00:02:41,095 --> 00:02:42,961
         And we're gonna roll it
             with a rolling pin.

78
00:02:42,963 --> 00:02:44,563
   So we don't get
the big air bubbles.

79
00:02:44,565 --> 00:02:47,966
 Right. And then, one full scoop
    of our house marinara sauce.

80
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:50,936
      And then, we actually just
        take it like this, here.

81
00:02:50,938 --> 00:02:52,638
That's how we move it
       around?
                        Yeah.

82
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,839
  No rubber spatula
     or nothin'?

83
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:54,673
          Swish it around. Nope.

84
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:55,674
     "Swish it"?

85
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:56,341
                    Yep.

86
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:57,709
  I never say that.

87
00:02:57,711 --> 00:02:59,511
       Then we add our toppings.

88
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:00,579
              Homemade sausage.

89
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:01,446
    Pork or beef?

90
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:02,814
      There's a mixture of both.

91
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:03,782
   Now pepperoni?

92
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:04,449
                    Yes.

93
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:05,884
   That is thick.

94
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:07,553
            Well, we're actually
              pretty well known

95
00:03:07,555 --> 00:03:09,054
             for our pepperoni.

96
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:09,955
                Bell peppers.

97
00:03:09,957 --> 00:03:11,490
   Thinly sliced.

98
00:03:11,492 --> 00:03:13,158
      Finally our Monterey Jack.

99
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,093
You guys melt the cheese
on top of everything?

100
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:15,861
              -Yep.
           -I dig it.

101
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:17,596
All into the oven at 650?

102
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:19,231
               15-20 minutes.

103
00:03:19,233 --> 00:03:21,466
It's gonna be crispy.

104
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:24,903
Oh, you're gonna love this --
 when you come here.

105
00:03:28,342 --> 00:03:30,442
 Mm. It's the yeast
    in the dough,

106
00:03:30,444 --> 00:03:31,777
 right off the bat,
    that you get.

107
00:03:31,779 --> 00:03:33,278
You can just smell it.

108
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,480
Look at that fat from
the pepperoni float to the top.

109
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:36,982
        Mmm.

110
00:03:36,984 --> 00:03:38,250
My other favorite part
     about this

111
00:03:38,252 --> 00:03:39,718
is the green bell pepper.

112
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,521
You guys slice it really thin,
it's all hot in that cheese,

113
00:03:42,523 --> 00:03:44,122
and then it kinda melts.
                        Mm-hmm.

114
00:03:44,124 --> 00:03:46,024
But the key is is that
you haven't changed this.

115
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:47,793
I've been eatin' this pizza
for nine or ten years

116
00:03:47,795 --> 00:03:49,094
   and it's still
 the exact same way

117
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:51,129
that I had it the first time.
   It's dynamite.

118
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:52,764
  And see ya later.

119
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:54,633
     House combo up in a minute!

120
00:03:54,635 --> 00:03:56,468
          This pizza is amazing!

121
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,937
This is my team from, uh,
"Guy's Grocery Games."

122
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:01,106
 They have seen some
  incredible food.

123
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:02,507
So, give me the rundown.

124
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:04,376
       Best pizza I've had
     in a long time in L.A.

125
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:07,746
 Fieri: But it took the stuff of
Hollywood legend to get it here.

126
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:09,114
            We didn't make pizza
                   in '45.

127
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:11,250
Barone's didn't have
    pizza in '45?

128
00:04:11,252 --> 00:04:13,719
            No. No. I don't know
  if you recall the Bowery Boys?

129
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:16,755
  They were a group of New York
 film stars in the '40s and '50s

130
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:19,658
  who came in for Italian when
they were shootin' in Hollywood.

131
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,460
  Well, they said, uh, "How come
     you don't have pizza here?"

132
00:04:21,462 --> 00:04:23,095
               My uncle said,
               "What's that?"

133
00:04:23,097 --> 00:04:24,596
              They said, "Well,
          it's big in New York."

134
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:27,699
Wow. Pizza hadn't made it
to the west coast yet?

135
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:30,502
        So, they gave it
      a try with one hitch.

136
00:04:30,504 --> 00:04:31,703
              All they had was
                a sheet pan.

137
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:34,006
 And the rectangle pie was born.

            Mix it all together.

161
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,421
We put a pretty thick amount.

162
00:05:22,423 --> 00:05:24,323
                 You think?
       This is like ricotta pie.

163
00:05:24,325 --> 00:05:25,957
And there you've got
  your first layer.

164
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:28,093
           There's another layer

  over underneath.

173

           Now, what temperature
      are we gonna bake this at?

00:05:41,742 --> 00:05:44,109

  for 1 1/2 hours.

             The sauce is nice.
            It balances it well.

  Shawn makes that?

   Correct. We'll just mix it up
             just a little bit.

00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:56,601

make the tempura shrimp?

Give me the breakdown
on the flours we're using.

00:09:28,035 --> 00:09:30,735

      Cornstarch. Potato starch.

286
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:31,469
 And a little salt?

287
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:32,137
               A little salt.

    we have to clean our shrimp.

made these little cuts.

 to cook your shrimp

299
00:09:46,787 --> 00:09:48,119
and cook it on a skewer

nice and straight --

that little technique there.
        Okay.

00:17:25,145 --> 00:17:27,945
    But, I haven't had very much
   hummus that's this fantastic.

540
00:17:27,947 --> 00:17:29,113
     Thank you.

541
00:17:29,115 --> 00:17:30,548
                 Fantastic.

542
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,650
Try it with the falafel.

543
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:38,456
            Seasoning's perfect,
         just look at the color.

544
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:42,627
              The warm falafel
     that's just buttery inside.

545
00:17:42,629 --> 00:17:44,862
               That olive oil
               is ridiculous.

546
00:17:44,864 --> 00:17:46,097
                     Oh.

547
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:48,032
           Fantastic, my friend.

548
00:17:48,034 --> 00:17:49,734
 Falafel and hummus
    appetizer up!

549
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:53,671
  I've been a big fan of their
    hummus for quite a while.

550
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:55,540
          North East Minneapolis
            wouldn't be the same

551
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:56,741
             without Holy Land.

552
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:58,843
    Man: Even when the store
           was small,

553
00:17:58,845 --> 00:18:01,679
 Majdi has been great supporter
       for our community.

554
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:04,348
  Fieri: Which is why the city
      even made August 12th

555
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,417
  Holy Land Day in Minneapolis.

556
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:07,718
     This is the glue that holds

557
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,287
             everything together
              for this street.

558
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:12,223
And it doesn't hurt that they're
  cooking up dishes like this.

559
00:18:12,225 --> 00:18:14,058
       Woman:
Arabic chicken shawirma wrap.

560
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,927
      Man: I've never eaten
   such a thing anywhere else.

561
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:18,262
       It's just awesome.

562
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:19,363
  Majdi: Now we're
 making the marinade

563
00:18:19,365 --> 00:18:20,665
for the Arabic chicken
      shawirma.

564
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:21,466
             Fieri: Fire it up.

565
00:18:21,468 --> 00:18:22,700
   Apple vinegar.

566
00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:24,368
   Yogurt. Onion.

567
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:25,303

00:18:31,478 --> 00:18:32,710
             "Wash your sister"?

573
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:34,812
Yes. Worcestershire.

574
00:18:34,814 --> 00:18:35,580
     I cannot --

575
00:18:35,582 --> 00:18:36,848
       "Wash your sister" sauce?

576
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:38,049
Yes, "Wash your sister" sauce.

577
00:18:38,051 --> 00:18:39,117
          [ Laughter ]

578
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:40,585
       Now --

582
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:45,590
                    Okay.

    Citric acid.

00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:54,499
             Citric acid again.

588
00:18:54,501 --> 00:18:57,101
Paprika. Ground saffron.

589
00:18:57,103 --> 00:18:58,503
              How about we just
               say what things

590
00:18:58,505 --> 00:18:59,837
          we didn't put in here?

591
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:00,705
 Yeah, that's good.

592
00:19:00,707 --> 00:19:01,372
                Laundry soap.

00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:02,340
     [ Laughs ]

594
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:03,007
       Curry.

595
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:04,208
              And then oregano.

596
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:05,443
         Now we get the chicken.
  Yes.

597
00:19:05,445 --> 00:19:06,577
            Natural, free range.

Natural, free range.

00:19:11,351 --> 00:19:12,416
 Halal slaughtered.

603
00:19:12,418 --> 00:19:14,252
              Now we're adding
        chicken shawirma spices.

604
00:19:14,254 --> 00:19:16,554
       Doctor.

605
00:19:16,556 --> 00:19:18,256
   We mix this up,
 we let it marinade.

606
00:19:18,258 --> 00:19:20,591
     In the cooler for 24 hours.
              Just stack it up.

607
00:19:20,593 --> 00:19:23,361
    Stack it up.

608
00:19:23,363 --> 00:19:24,762
                   Ta-da!

00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:26,864
             It's breast, thigh,

                 To the top.

612
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,601
             Then we load it up,
                cut it thin?

613
00:19:30,603 --> 00:19:32,069
  Cut it thin.
                    I dig it.

614
00:19:32,071 --> 00:19:33,771
Now we're bringing it up
  to the flat-top.

615
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:36,107
First, garlic butter.
 Then, the chicken.

616
00:19:36,109 --> 00:19:37,308
 Then, Lianne sauce.

617
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,376
             What is it called?

    Lianne sauce.
Lianne is my daughter, yes.

619
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:41,345
                Lianne sauce?
      You named it after Lianne?

620
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:43,481
Yes. Salt and pepper.

621
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:46,250
    Garlic mayo.
Cook it for 60 seconds.

622
00:19:46,252 --> 00:19:47,485
    leave it set.

623
00:19:47,487 --> 00:19:48,519
      Chicken.

624
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:49,687

    Garlic mayo.

627
00:19:51,925 --> 00:19:55,193
We roll it, toast it.

628
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:56,527
             Look at this, huh?

629
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,095
Wrap it. And then --

630
00:19:58,097 --> 00:19:58,896
                  Tear it?

631
00:19:58,898 --> 00:20:01,399
             That's how it goes.

00:20:05,305 --> 00:20:06,070
             What is the bread?

633

      Yeah.

637
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:12,076
            A little bit of acid
              from the pickles.

638
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:13,878
               Nice and creamy
        with that mayo in there.

639
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,480
              You cook it low,
              you cook it slow.

640
00:20:16,482 --> 00:20:18,749
               All the spices
          get into that chicken.

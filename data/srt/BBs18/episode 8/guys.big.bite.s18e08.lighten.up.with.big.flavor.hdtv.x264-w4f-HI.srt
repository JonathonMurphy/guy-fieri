     Welcome to "Big Bite."

00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,321
 You know, the older I get, the
  healthier I think I'm eating.

00:00:22,323 --> 00:00:24,456
         I mean, really.
  I'm not even trying to do it.

     It's just -- I need it.

00:00:25,793 --> 00:00:27,993
   So, what's one of the ways
   I'm doing that? With fish.

00:00:27,995 --> 00:00:30,329
   Yeah, not your regular fish
       that sounds boring.

 We got to big with the flavor,

 infused with a citrus marinade

served with a spicy grilled-corn

   red-quinoa-and-mango salad.

17
00:00:50,918 --> 00:00:53,552
   It's got diced tri-colored
    bell peppers, fresh mint,

18
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:56,121
     and Dijon vinaigrette.
  I mean, this is so on point.

19
00:00:56,123 --> 00:00:57,389
      And this is to prove

20
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:59,324
          that healthy
  can actually mean flavorful.

21
00:00:59,326 --> 00:01:01,827
    I know. Listen, we start
    saying there's gonna be
    fish on the menu,

22
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:03,695
        people are like,
       "Eh, I don't know.

23
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:06,031

   "When is it taco night?"

24
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:08,901

        you just wait --
   Big, big flavor on the way.

26
00:01:11,005 --> 00:01:13,739
 So I've sliced up some thin red
 onions, and here's the kicker.

27
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:16,141
  So the red onions like this,
    we're gonna pickle them,

28
00:01:16,143 --> 00:01:18,610
  and I love pickled veggies --
    giardiniera, you name it.

29
00:01:18,612 --> 00:01:20,145
But here's the thing with these.

30
00:01:20,147 --> 00:01:22,081
  They got a nice little color
            to them.

31
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:24,616
   What we're gonna do is use
    a little bit of this beet

32
00:01:24,618 --> 00:01:27,186
    to really bring some real
   nice, big, red color to it.

33
00:01:27,188 --> 00:01:29,388
It's not gonna change the flavor
            a bunch.

 Let's get some vinegar in here.

36
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:35,427
       Apple cider vinegar
      is perfect for this.

37
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:37,930
 Why? A little bit of sweetness,
         not too harsh.

38
00:01:37,932 --> 00:01:41,200
    And I need a good amount.

39
00:01:41,202 --> 00:01:43,102
         Add some sugar.

   a little black peppercorn.

43
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:54,046
          I don't know,
  about a dozen of those. Okay.

       about it right now.

        This is gonna be

00:03:24,104 --> 00:03:29,308
       A couple oranges...
      go right into a bowl.

80
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:31,677
      Now, what do we like
        about the orange?

81
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:33,712
        We like the zest.
    If you can get this zest

82
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:35,614
   and really start to impart
          that flavor,

83
00:03:35,616 --> 00:03:38,050
  we don't want to put too much
     of the citrus in there

  because we'll start to, what?
     Cook the fish, exactly.

85

    We're not making seviche.

86
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:45,023
    So get a nice little bit
    of the zest off of here.

87
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,026
  These are pretty big oranges.

88
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:50,329
     I can probably get away
        with one of them.

89
00:03:50,331 --> 00:03:54,166
This is where having that juicer
     really comes into play.

93
00:04:07,147 --> 00:04:09,481
        Now, throwing in
     a little achiote paste,

94
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:11,316
 or a little achiote seasoning,
          I should say.

95
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:12,884
   There's all different kinds
            of this,

96
00:04:12,886 --> 00:04:14,419
          but it comes
     from the annatto seed.

97
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:16,054
       In this situation,
       it's been ground up

98
00:04:16,056 --> 00:04:18,257
   with a little bit of spice,
   probably a little paprika,

99
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:20,125
     maybe a little cayenne,
      maybe a little cumin.

100
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:22,427
   So there will be
   different styles out there.
   Find the one you like.

101
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,329
      But you want to talk
      about awesome color?

102
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:26,898
  This is where all your color
        is gonna come in.

103
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,067
              Okay.

104
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:30,235
         So there we go.

105
00:04:30,237 --> 00:04:32,971
    A little of the achiote.

106
00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:35,007
     A touch of some cumin.

107
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:40,512
 The flavors are gonna be subtle
     working with this fish,

108
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:42,948
   but there's all this flavor
coming in from this banana leaf.

109
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,916
              Okay.

110
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:46,251
            Mix that.

111
00:04:46,253 --> 00:04:49,254
 A little extra-virgin olive oil
        to cut it a bit.

112
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:52,724
I will be adding salt and pepper
to it later when I put the
fish in the banana leaf,

113
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:56,261
       But for right now,
 I'm just letting that dissolve.

114
00:04:56,263 --> 00:04:59,398
          There we go.
           All right.

115
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,000
    Now we're gonna let this
        counter-marinade

116
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:03,435
     just about 45 minutes.

117
00:05:03,437 --> 00:05:06,071
 Remember, we can over-marinate
           this fish.

118
00:05:06,073 --> 00:05:10,309
    Even though I didn't use
      a ton of the citrus,

119
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:11,643
      it can over-marinate.

120
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,211
       So watch yourself.

121
00:05:13,213 --> 00:05:16,415
   Look at this white, flaky,
           firm fish.

122
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:21,186
     Those thinner pieces --
That's usually Ryder's favorite.

123
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:23,055
          There we go.

124
00:05:23,057 --> 00:05:28,226
    They cook a little more.
   Don't seem so intimidating.

125
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:30,195
              Okay.

126
00:05:30,197 --> 00:05:31,663
 Pour the marinade over the top.

127
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:34,166
  The reason for the resealable
 bag is I can get a lot of work

128
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:36,902
 out of a little bit of marinade
       by having the bag.

129
00:05:36,904 --> 00:05:40,005
           Because now
   I can move it around, okay?

130
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:42,541
    And then if I squeeze out
        the excess air --

131
00:05:42,543 --> 00:05:45,110
          You see this?
 Squeezing out that excess air.

132
00:05:45,112 --> 00:05:46,712
 Everybody's getting marinated,

133
00:05:46,714 --> 00:05:49,514
     one orange, maybe three
  tablespoons of the olive oil.

134
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:50,782
      We're in good shape.

135
00:05:50,784 --> 00:05:52,884
      So I'll let that set.

136
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:54,686
          Right there.

137
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:56,955
    Now take a look at this.

138
00:05:56,957 --> 00:05:59,291
           Take a look
at what's going on here already.

139
00:05:59,293 --> 00:06:01,893
    Look at the color already
        that's happening

140
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:04,830
  from that little bit of beet
      that I put in there.

141
00:06:04,832 --> 00:06:06,665
      Okay. That's enough.

142
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:11,169
    It's just gonna continue
  to steep in that hot liquid.

143
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:15,307
 So I'll just go ahead, bring it
over here, and let it cool down.

144
00:06:15,309 --> 00:06:17,843
   Ahh, that's gorgeous, huh?

145
00:06:17,845 --> 00:06:20,212
    We'll take the beets out
 when we eat the pickled onions.

146
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:22,514
  But just for the time being,
    we'll just them sit there

147
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:24,649
   and just continue to bring
     the color to the dish.

148
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:27,152
    All right. Now let's talk
      about the corn salsa.

149
00:06:27,154 --> 00:06:30,355
 I got to grab the whole thing.

150
00:06:30,357 --> 00:06:33,625
          I got it all.
    The bounty of the county.

151
00:06:33,627 --> 00:06:35,627
     So what am I gonna love
           about this?

152
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:38,230
 Well, the charring the veggies
       right off the bat.

153
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:40,632
       So, we'll grab some
    of these Fresno chilies,

154
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:43,802
    give them a little squirt
       of some olive oil.

155
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:48,039
    A little salt and pepper.

156
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,475
Let me get the poblanos in here,
            as well.

157
00:06:54,181 --> 00:06:56,214
   Hit those onto the grill --

158
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:58,450
    a cross between hardwood
         and briquettes.

159
00:06:58,452 --> 00:07:01,253
      Briquettes to give me
 that long-running temperature.

160
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:04,156
   Hardwood to really bring in
       some of the flavor.

161
00:07:04,158 --> 00:07:06,625
   So we'll throw these down,
    let them start charring.

162
00:07:06,627 --> 00:07:08,994
   I've got to husk some corn.
      Anybody want to help?

163
00:07:08,996 --> 00:07:10,729
     That's what I figured.
        Well, come back.

164
00:07:10,731 --> 00:07:12,564
       I'll husk the corn,
     throw it on the grill.

165
00:07:12,566 --> 00:07:14,132
            Poblanos,
    we got the Fresnos down.

166
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:18,069
     The beets -- The onions
   are pickling in the beets.

167
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:19,771
       And we'll put fish
        into banana leaf.

168
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,606
  I know it sounds like a mess,
 but it's gonna be a good time.

169
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:22,808
        See you in a bit.

             Oh! Oh!
         Hey, hey! Hey!

172
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,152
  Right over here! Right here.
    Come on over to the sink.

173
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:36,988
   I'm doing the real exciting
  piece of rinsing the quinoa.

174
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,358
  Yeah, it's a real hot topic.
          There we go.

175
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,727
     Got to rinse the quinoa
   and get rid of the saponin.

176
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:44,696
      Like, what's saponin?
           [what's happenin'?]

177
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:46,865
It's this bitter little exterior
          on the quinoa

178
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:50,135
    that is probably one
    of the reasons a lot of
    people don't eat quinoa.

179
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:53,538
     Sometimes, you'll find
     quinoa and it already
     has that rinsed off it.

180
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,740
     But for the most part,
      you need to rinse it.

181
00:07:55,742 --> 00:08:01,446
   So into some boiling water,
and I'm gonna give this a cover.

182
00:08:01,448 --> 00:08:03,915
   This beautiful red quinoa's
         gonna sit here

183
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:06,952
     and just steam and pop.

184
00:08:06,954 --> 00:08:09,421
   You know, the little quinoa
     just pop. It's awesome.

185
00:08:09,423 --> 00:08:11,923
   So this is all for my what?
    Exactly. My healthy show.

186
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:14,693
    The quinoa's gonna
    come together, but
    you're looking back here

187
00:08:14,695 --> 00:08:16,461
       and you're saying,
      "Ooh. What is that?"

188
00:08:16,463 --> 00:08:18,964
   Well, we've got some beets
    that are actually sharing

189
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:21,433
      their beautiful color
  with some pickled red onions,

190
00:08:21,435 --> 00:08:23,802
    and that's all gonna come
     together for some fish.

191
00:08:23,804 --> 00:08:25,570
  But before we do any of that,

192
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:28,340
      let me get my peppers
         off the grill.

193
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:31,576
   Now, I've got some poblano
        and some Fresnos,

194
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:33,478
   and these are all gonna be

195
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,348
       for this fantastic
       charred corn salsa.

196
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:39,985
  Look at that. A little touch
 of olive oil, salt, and pepper.

197
00:08:39,987 --> 00:08:42,821
         Bring them off.
  You know the routine, right?

198
00:08:42,823 --> 00:08:44,956
   Just a little plastic wrap.

199
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,125
 Just fighting it for a second.

200
00:08:51,298 --> 00:08:52,731
       This is a great way
         to sweat them.

201
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:54,866
   You know, sometimes if you
  don't have the plastic wrap,

202
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,034
   as long as you can get them

203
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:57,936
  in something that will allow
         them to steam,

204
00:08:57,938 --> 00:08:59,804
   I've seen people even do it
         in a paper bag

205
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:02,073
     or a plastic container
 that you can close the lid on.

206
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:04,709
              Okay.
  Let those steam up like that.

207
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,778
   And I'll grab the corn off.

208
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,214
I'm gonna let the corn cool down

209
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:12,984
  before I go and start to cut
      all the kernels off.

210
00:09:12,986 --> 00:09:14,519
 And I got a nice hot fire going

211
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:17,355
  for some fantastic fish that
  I have marinating right here.

212
00:09:17,357 --> 00:09:19,958
          So let me --
   I'll put these right here.

213
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,393
    Okay, fish is here, done.

214
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:24,029
  A little bit of orange juice,
  a little bit of orange zest.

215
00:09:24,031 --> 00:09:25,330
   That's the real key to it.

216
00:09:25,332 --> 00:09:26,798
 So, first thing we're gonna do

217
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,335
   is work with this gigantic
     elephant in the room --

218
00:09:30,337 --> 00:09:33,605
  Actually, I'll take this one.
  And that is this banana leaf.

219
00:09:33,607 --> 00:09:35,440
   So the banana leaves I had
           were fresh.

220
00:09:35,442 --> 00:09:37,909
 Sometimes they'll come frozen,
     but the idea is to find

221
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:40,211
    the banana leaf that has
    some good portions to it.

222
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:42,213
   A good 4-to-5-inch widths.

223
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:44,950
You're cutting off the backbone,
 or cutting out the strong seam

224
00:09:44,952 --> 00:09:47,252
   of the leaf, 'cause the two
    leaves would peel apart.

225
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:49,888
  And then taking off the rough
edge that may be freezer-burned,

226
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:52,157
      or if it's dried out
 a little bit, pulling that off.

227
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:56,094
   So getting some real nice,
     clean, durable portions

228
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:59,297
       of the banana leaf,
  4 inches by about 10 inches.

229
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:02,534
       Laying the two down
 and crossing them over the top.

230
00:10:02,536 --> 00:10:04,769
       Putting the seafood
         in the center,

231
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,805
  putting that Chilean sea bass
         in the center.

232
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:11,376
         A little touch
   of the black pepper, salt.

233
00:10:11,378 --> 00:10:14,446
   Folding one over the other
     so they're overlapping.

234
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:16,648
 This was the original tinfoil.

235
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,216
           This is how
     it was all getting done

236
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:21,252
   before we had plastic wrap
          and tinfoil.

237
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:22,887
   And then pinning them shut

238
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:25,757
  with a real strong toothpick
        or bamboo stick,

239
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:27,626
  and they really hold together
             great.

240
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:30,562
      Voilà. Not bad, huh?
        Three more to go.

       Okay. The last one.

243
00:11:02,062 --> 00:11:04,362
    And I know you're looking
    at this right now going,

244
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:06,431
         "Wait a second.
    Is it really that easy?"

245
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:08,933
  It is totally that easy, and
  you are gonna love doing this

246
00:11:08,935 --> 00:11:11,536
  because depending on, I mean,
 you could put shrimp in there.

247
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:14,039
  There's so much great flavor
  that could be built in there.

248
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,306
   You could put some onions,

249
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:17,642
   and there could be peppers
      in it -- You name it.

250
00:11:17,644 --> 00:11:19,077
 But these stack up super-easy.

251
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:21,079
   Bring them right over here
          to the grill.

252
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:22,914
   I'm gonna raise this grill
      up here for a second,

253
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:24,315
    'cause I don't want to go
            too fast.

254
00:11:24,317 --> 00:11:26,017
  I'm trying to get two things
         happening here.

255
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,687
 I'm trying to get a little bit
 of steam and I'm trying to get

256
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:31,456
    a little bit of a grill.

257
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,992
   So I'm gonna watch this and
 make sure that it doesn't burn,

258
00:11:33,994 --> 00:11:36,528
that these edges don't get brown
   too fast, but look at that.

259
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:39,097
        Right like that.
     Fantastic shape. Okay.

260
00:11:39,099 --> 00:11:42,367
Now we'll talk about the quinoa.
   Now, I'm a huge quinoa fan.

261
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:45,070
    When my sister Morgan --
    She was one that first
    taught me about it --

262
00:11:45,072 --> 00:11:47,839
    and she just showed all
    these different flavors
    that you could add to it.

263
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:50,508
       I mean, it's really
       a fantastic canvas.

264
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,010
     The beauty about it is

265
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:53,978
      is that it'll take on
    anything you do with it.

266
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,715
   I'm gonna dice these down.
  We'll put this all together.

267
00:11:56,717 --> 00:11:58,883
        You're gonna get
    this super-flavorful fish

268
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,185
    steamed in a banana leaf,

269
00:12:00,187 --> 00:12:02,454
  a little kiss of that orange
         coming through.

270
00:12:02,456 --> 00:12:04,322

     I love the food I make.

279

    I love the style of food,
         but it is so --

280
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:24,209
   There is a lot of chopping.

281

 a lot of people here helping me

283
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:32,183
  All right. So, some red bell
   pepper, yellow bell pepper,

284
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:34,285
          some mangoes,
     some orange bell pepper

       all coming together
   for this fantastic quinoa.

286
00:12:36,523 --> 00:12:38,690
   A little red quinoa in here
        that's steaming.

287
00:12:38,692 --> 00:12:40,225
It'll be ready in just a second.

288
00:12:40,227 --> 00:12:42,393
 I'm gonna fluff it, lay it out,
          let it cool,

289
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:44,229
   and make this awesome salad
            with it.

290
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:47,398
   But the star of the show --
      Let me show you this.

291
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,735
  The star of this healthy show
     is my Chilean sea bass,

292
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:52,670
   and not just any sea bass.

293
00:12:52,672 --> 00:12:55,340
      First, I marinated it
 in a little bit of orange juice

294
00:12:55,342 --> 00:12:57,909
    with some achiote powder
   and a little bit of cumin.

295
00:12:57,911 --> 00:13:00,378
 I did a little bit of the zest
      so I get some of that

296
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,947
    real nice citrusy flavor
 with not too much of the acid.

297
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:05,049
  Then took it, let it marinate
       for about an hour,

298
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:06,751
             hit it
 with a little salt and pepper,

299
00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:08,453
         wrapped it here
      in the banana leaves.

300
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:09,954
  Tell me that's not dynamite.

301
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:11,723
    And just use a toothpick
         to close it up.

302
00:13:11,725 --> 00:13:13,825
 And just letting them sit here
    and steam inside of that,

303
00:13:13,827 --> 00:13:15,660
    you can see a little bit
    of the juice coming out.

304
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:17,695
     It's gonna be fantastic
 over a little bit of hardwood.

305
00:13:17,697 --> 00:13:19,931
           No problem.
    Let me get this started.

306
00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:24,502
      I've got...this salad
        coming together.

307
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:28,373
      It was a lot of prep.
    Totally worth it, though.

308
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:32,243
  Here we go. Back of the knife
 to keep from dulling the blade.

309
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:35,280
 And all those great veggies --
    I mean, look at the color

310
00:13:35,282 --> 00:13:37,816
 that's gonna be inside of this
      with that red quinoa.

311
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:39,284
              Okay.

312
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:44,756
Some of my red onions back there

313
00:13:44,758 --> 00:13:46,157
             sitting
   in some of that beet juice.

314
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,759
       Oh, dynamite color.

315
00:13:47,761 --> 00:13:50,428
              Okay.
      Shallots and garlic.

316
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:53,464
            Shallot.

317
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:56,234
          Now, this --

318
00:13:56,236 --> 00:13:58,636
   Break it down the same way
  that you break down an onion.

319
00:13:58,638 --> 00:14:00,071
              Okay?

320
00:14:00,073 --> 00:14:03,174
    I'll give it a few slices
     right through the side.

321
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:06,644
 Do all the dicing in one shot.

322
00:14:06,646 --> 00:14:09,013
     Right on top. Just like
     we're working an onion.

323
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:13,852
 Making it really nice and fine

324
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:16,788
      so it'll work its way
    into the dressing evenly.

325
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:19,624
   Run it over one more time.

326
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:24,095
           Here we go.

327
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:26,431
     And we'll drop that in
        for the dressing.

328
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:30,101
          Same thing --
   Got to go with some garlic.

329
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:32,570
     Just coming to give it
      a little rough chop.

330
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:36,007
The idea is to really break down
           the garlic.

331
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:41,880
              Okay.

332
00:14:43,817 --> 00:14:47,518
 Okay. That comes together. Let
  me get a little salt in here.

333
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,687
     A little black pepper.

334
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:53,858
        We're gonna need
       a touch of mustard.

335
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,260
       The mustard's nice

336
00:14:55,262 --> 00:14:57,795
   because it always helps in
 the emulsification side of it.

337
00:14:57,797 --> 00:15:02,700
So we get a little bit of Dijon,
    a little white balsamic.

338
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:06,404
          There we go.

339
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:11,442
              Okay.
 So that's all mixed up nicely.

340
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:15,113
           Now a touch
   of extra virgin olive oil.

341
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:16,648
    Putting in that mustard,

342
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:19,817
    it'll help bring the oil
    and the vinegar together.

343
00:15:19,819 --> 00:15:24,055
     Okay? We all know that
     from making a dressing.

344
00:15:24,057 --> 00:15:26,190
         A little taste.

345
00:15:27,627 --> 00:15:30,161
         That's spot-on.
     Exactly what I wanted.

346
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:32,864
      Crunchy of the vegs,
       sweet of the mango,

347
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:35,566
  a little kiss of the mustard,
 definitely the garlic in there,

348
00:15:35,568 --> 00:15:37,535
    shallots, and that'll all
  mellow out here in a second.

349
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:39,938
              Okay.
     Let's get into quinoa.

350
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:43,274
              So...
    Yeah, that's a good size.

351
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:44,676
       This is red quinoa.

352
00:15:44,678 --> 00:15:46,978
      I rinsed it first...

353
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,180
             to get
   that little bitter taste --

354
00:15:49,182 --> 00:15:51,716
   Everybody's had that bitter
    taste before from quinoa.

355
00:15:51,718 --> 00:15:53,318
              Okay?

356
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,287
Some quinoa will come pre-rinsed
     for you. I don't know.

357
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,856
 I can go with the old-fashioned
  stuff and do my own rinsing.

358
00:15:58,858 --> 00:16:00,925
              Okay?

359
00:16:00,927 --> 00:16:02,827
         Feather it out.

360
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:04,595
  Kind of like doing with rice,

361
00:16:04,597 --> 00:16:06,898
 just kind of letting it finish
      its steaming process.

362
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,467
 It'll kind of separate a little
   bit. It won't be so clumpy.

363
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,269
        But look at that.

364
00:16:11,271 --> 00:16:13,304
      Mmm. Nice and nutty.

365
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:16,040
   Okay. So we'll set this off
          to the side.

366
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:18,843
         Now let's talk
      about these peppers.

367
00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:22,880
    So I've got some poblanos
        and some Fresnos,

368
00:16:22,882 --> 00:16:24,282
    threw them on the grill,

369
00:16:24,284 --> 00:16:27,585
   a little bit of olive oil,
salt and pepper, let them steam.

370
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:30,555
    You know what that does?
   It just kicks off the skin.

371
00:16:30,557 --> 00:16:33,257
 This is all gonna come together
     with this roasted corn.

372
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:35,026
 So I've got to cut the kernels
          off the corn,

373
00:16:35,028 --> 00:16:36,694
      got to take and skin
       these peppers down,

374
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:38,563
   get the seeds and the stems
       and everything out.

375
00:16:38,565 --> 00:16:40,031
    That'll all come together
          for a salsa.

376
00:16:40,033 --> 00:16:41,966
Here's what we're talking about,
      ladies and gentlemen.

377
00:16:41,968 --> 00:16:43,401
       We're talking about

378
00:16:43,403 --> 00:16:46,504
  a fantastic Chilean sea bass
    wrapped in a banana leaf.

379
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:49,407
  Then we're gonna toss it with
some of this roasted-corn salsa,

380
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:51,909
      and then we take some
 of those pickled onions on top.

381
00:16:51,911 --> 00:16:55,613
   Are you kidding me? All
   with a quinoa salad coming
   together when you get back.

382
00:16:55,615 --> 00:16:58,416
   And if you want to stop
   by the house and help with
   this, it'd be really nice.

     We got some red quinoa,

00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,392
    I've got some tri-colored
      bell peppers in here,

387
00:17:07,394 --> 00:17:09,127
      a little bit of mint
          dropping in,

388
00:17:09,129 --> 00:17:10,428
    made a touch of dressing

        So drop that in.

393

  People are flying in for it.
       You can hear them.

394

           All right.

395

         Set that aside.

396
00:17:29,349 --> 00:17:32,850
 Now give it a quick little mix.

397
00:17:32,852 --> 00:17:35,019
      I've got the dressing
        already in there.

398
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:36,687
          Look at that.
         It's gorgeous.

399
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:38,689

 really just gonna open that up,

400
00:17:38,691 --> 00:17:40,291

 A little crunchiness from some
 of the shallot I threw in there

402
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:44,128
     and a touch of garlic.

403
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:46,531
Let those kind of work their way
       into the dressing.

404
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:49,333
      So really flavorful.

00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:51,002

              Mmm.

408
00:17:57,844 --> 00:17:59,944
    Outstanding. Outstanding.

409
00:17:59,946 --> 00:18:02,680
    All right. Now let's talk
       about a corn salsa.

410
00:18:02,682 --> 00:18:05,183
     So, I've got this fish
   that's finishing right now.

411
00:18:05,185 --> 00:18:07,518
        Chilean sea bass.
           Outrageous.

412
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,987
What we're gonna dump in here --
           red onion,

413
00:18:09,989 --> 00:18:12,957
     a little bit of garlic
 that I already had broken down,

414
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:15,059
            minced it
      really nice and fine.

415
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:17,528
          Then I've got
    some Fresno chilies here,

416
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,697
      as well as poblanos.

417
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:23,201
  And these are just gonna get
      a quick little touch.

418
00:18:23,203 --> 00:18:25,069
           Here we go.

419
00:18:26,473 --> 00:18:29,073
   So give it a touch of salt.

420
00:18:29,075 --> 00:18:31,342
         A little agave.

421
00:18:31,344 --> 00:18:35,413
      Yep, agave just like
       in making tequila.

422
00:18:35,415 --> 00:18:37,115
              Okay.

423
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:40,751
   A little zest of some lime.

424
00:18:43,223 --> 00:18:49,026
   And this just makes its own
natural vinaigrette right there.

425
00:18:49,028 --> 00:18:51,596
              Okay.

426
00:18:51,598 --> 00:18:53,231
            Get this.

427
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:54,632
    I just want to make sure

428
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:58,369
      that I got that agave
 and that lime working together.

429
00:18:58,371 --> 00:19:00,071
    But look at those colors.

430
00:19:00,073 --> 00:19:02,573
  Toasted that corn, or roasted
  it, right there on the grill.

431
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:05,476
      Okay. Some scallions.

432
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:14,051
              Okay.

433
00:19:14,053 --> 00:19:16,521
 All right, we'll drop this in.

434
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:22,393
              Okay.
      This is all together.

435
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:24,729
    Now let's take a look --
   It's time to grab the fish.

436
00:19:24,731 --> 00:19:26,998
 Now, the fish have been wrapped
        in banana leaves.

437
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,566
        This is my piece.

438
00:19:28,568 --> 00:19:31,569
 So I'll show you how beautiful
      this is going to be.

439
00:19:31,571 --> 00:19:35,139
 We marinated it in a little bit
of orange juice and orange zest.

440
00:19:35,141 --> 00:19:36,874
  But is that gorgeous or what?

441
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:39,310
   Let's slide that right off.

442
00:19:41,147 --> 00:19:44,949
           Natural --
    That's your natural foil.

443
00:19:44,951 --> 00:19:47,285
               Oh.

444
00:19:47,287 --> 00:19:49,353
            A little
    of this ground achiote --

445
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:52,924
   So it's a really nice color
        coming out of it.

446
00:19:52,926 --> 00:19:56,494
  Put some of this quinoa salad
       right on the side.

447
00:19:56,496 --> 00:19:59,030
          Tell me that
just doesn't look like confetti,

448
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:01,699
  like a parade in Flavortown.

449
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:03,634
   Now we'll drop a little bit
        of the corn salsa

450
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:05,203
      right on top of that.

451
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:07,738
  And then a touch -- and this
is how we started everything off

452
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,907
          is with these
       pickled red onions.

453
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:11,342
        Now, you've done
       pickled red onions,

454
00:20:11,344 --> 00:20:14,545
     but have they ever been
       that beautiful red?

455
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,447
      Take a look at that.

456
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:22,753
       Fresh veggies. Mmm.

457
00:20:22,755 --> 00:20:24,956
  That salad is just dynamite.

458
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:27,058
   And the Chilean sea bass --

459
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:31,128
   Remember what I was saying
  about the big, flaky pieces?

460
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:34,599
   A little bit of that onion
          right on top.

461
00:20:40,707 --> 00:20:42,807
Don't tell anybody it's healthy,
           all right?

462
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:45,476
    Just keep going with the,
 "Oh, yeah. It tastes delicious.

463
00:20:45,478 --> 00:20:47,278
   Must not be good for you."

464
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,679
  And the kids will eat it up.

465
00:20:48,681 --> 00:20:52,049
  You got the grab this one --
  footnetwork.com/guysbigbite.

466
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:55,253
  Go healthy. You're gonna love
     it. See you next week.

467
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:57,021
          Outstanding.

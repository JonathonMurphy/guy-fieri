1
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:18,317
Welcome to "Big Bite."

2
00:00:18,319 --> 00:00:21,120
You know, here in this backyard,
in this kitchen, I have hosted

3
00:00:21,122 --> 00:00:24,490
some of the probably most
outrageous game day feasts.

4
00:00:24,492 --> 00:00:26,225
I mean, I've done it all.
I've done the nachos.

5
00:00:26,227 --> 00:00:28,060
I've done the tacos.
I've done the burgers.

6
00:00:28,062 --> 00:00:29,595
About anything in the world
that you could ever

7
00:00:29,597 --> 00:00:32,164
imagine to barbecue,
I have done right here.

8
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:34,633
But one of the number-one
requests, you know what it is?

9
00:00:34,635 --> 00:00:37,069
Chili.
And not any regular chili.

10
00:00:37,071 --> 00:00:39,104
We're talking Texas-style.

11
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:42,941
No tomatoes, no beans,
real deal Texas-style chili,

12
00:00:42,943 --> 00:00:44,476
and that's what I'm gonna
give you today.

13
00:00:44,478 --> 00:00:48,147
My Texas-style chili is packed
with ground beef, cubed beef,

14
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:51,617
dried chilies, fresh chilies,
onions, garlic, cumin and more.

15
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:53,118
And it's served with, get this,

16
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,154
a beer cheddar cheese sauce.

17
00:00:55,156 --> 00:00:57,122
Oh, yeah. This is the one
that's guaranteed to score

18
00:00:57,124 --> 00:00:58,690
some major points.
Get it?

19
00:00:58,692 --> 00:01:00,025
Game day points.
All right.

20
00:01:00,027 --> 00:01:03,162
On the side, how about
some elevated potato skins?

21
00:01:03,164 --> 00:01:06,265
I'm upping the game
on this game day classic

22
00:01:06,267 --> 00:01:09,234
with leeks, mushrooms,
brie cheese and prosciutto.

23
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:11,537
And you can bet those are gonna
fly off the plate.

24
00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:13,772
In fact, you might want
to make a double batch.

25
00:01:13,774 --> 00:01:15,274
All right.
Let's get started.

26
00:01:15,276 --> 00:01:16,875
Dutch oven going hot.

27
00:01:16,877 --> 00:01:18,077
Onions busted down.

28
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:20,579
A little bit of garlic
into my peppers.

29
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:21,947
So listen.
You're gonna

30
00:01:21,949 --> 00:01:23,715
find your favorite peppers
that you like to work with.

31
00:01:23,717 --> 00:01:25,717
This chili
is not outrageously hot.

32
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:28,253
So it doesn't mean that you
have to go with the big heat.

33
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:31,423
But we're gonna
use some Anaheims right here.

34
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:32,958
Okay.
And we got a bunch

35
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,726
a bunch of dry chilies that
we're gonna bust into as well.

36
00:01:34,728 --> 00:01:37,396
Now, I'm gonna cut 'em
down into a pretty usable size.

37
00:01:37,398 --> 00:01:39,364
Actually, let me go ahead and
drop some of these now 'cause

38
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:41,333
it's gonna take some time
to sweat 'em.

39
00:01:41,335 --> 00:01:44,470
So a little bit of olive oil.

40
00:01:44,472 --> 00:01:48,240
We'll get down
with the onions right now.

41
00:01:48,242 --> 00:01:49,975
And this is, just like I said,

42
00:01:49,977 --> 00:01:53,579
no beans, no tomatoes.

43
00:01:53,581 --> 00:01:54,947
And that's what's funny.

44
00:01:54,949 --> 00:01:56,315
Because when you give people
chili like this,

45
00:01:56,317 --> 00:01:57,749
they're like, "Hey, I think
you're missing something.

46
00:01:57,751 --> 00:01:59,418
This kind of looks
like a meat sauce."

47
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:03,021
Well, you got to remember...
Chili con carne.

48
00:02:03,023 --> 00:02:05,057
Meat and pepper.

49
00:02:05,059 --> 00:02:06,825
Okay.

50
00:02:06,827 --> 00:02:09,862
Drop those down.

51
00:02:09,864 --> 00:02:12,631
A great way
to break this chili down...

52
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:13,999
Split 'em,

53
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:17,402
take the seeds, not a lot
of membrane inside of here.

54
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:19,037
That... just the key

55
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:22,608
is just to make sure
we got some uniform sizes.

56
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:25,377
There we go.

57
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,045
Some red bell.

58
00:02:33,154 --> 00:02:35,287
Okay.

59
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:37,623
Drop those in.
Look at that.

60
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:39,391
Just sweating up nice.

61
00:02:39,393 --> 00:02:40,626
This Fresno chili here,

62
00:02:40,628 --> 00:02:42,294
I'm not too worried
about the heat on it.

63
00:02:42,296 --> 00:02:43,662
Pretty mild.

64
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:47,733
So I'll just give it
a couple slices down the front.

65
00:02:47,735 --> 00:02:51,036
And I won't add that garlic yet
because I don't want it to burn.

66
00:02:51,038 --> 00:02:52,771
And I got a lot of heat
going in this right now.

67
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:54,406
So far, so good, huh?

68
00:02:54,408 --> 00:02:56,542
Okay.

69
00:02:56,544 --> 00:02:59,344
Let this continue to sweat down.

70
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:01,146
Add a little bit of salt to it.

71
00:03:01,148 --> 00:03:02,447
Let's get into dry chilies.

72
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:05,951
Now, this is really
the foundation of this chili.

73
00:03:05,953 --> 00:03:07,553
So what we're first starting off

74
00:03:07,555 --> 00:03:11,223
is with some Chile de arbol,
which is nice and spicy.

75
00:03:11,225 --> 00:03:15,194
The ancho and Guajillo chile,

76
00:03:15,196 --> 00:03:17,763
which, to me,
is my favorite dry chili.

77
00:03:17,765 --> 00:03:19,865
And so the ancho's deep
and rich.

78
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:22,367
The Guajillo's got
a nice little spice and kick.

79
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:23,702
And, of course,
the Chile de arbol

80
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:25,737
has definitely got the heat.

81
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:27,306
So taking those,

82
00:03:27,308 --> 00:03:29,808
charring 'em is the beginning
of this dish.

83
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,343
And, believe it or not, the red
color that's gonna come out

84
00:03:31,345 --> 00:03:32,744
is gonna be outrageous.

85
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:33,845
So these will sit here
and toast.

86
00:03:33,847 --> 00:03:35,647
Get a little more heat on that.

87
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:37,349
There we go.

88
00:03:37,351 --> 00:03:40,285
Let me get this stuff
in the compost.

89
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:41,820
And let's talk about potatoes.

90
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:44,289
So a lot of people
show up for game day feast.

91
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:47,359
And they're expecting the...
The regular old fare.

92
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:48,894
We're gonna
do some potato skins.

93
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:50,796
Oh, but we're gonna fill 'em
with brie and prosciutto.

94
00:03:50,798 --> 00:03:52,164
Just got to knock it...

95
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:54,366
You just can't let 'em know
what's coming.

96
00:03:54,368 --> 00:03:55,634
Got to give 'em a little
surprise.

97
00:03:55,636 --> 00:04:00,072
So here is some beautiful
baked Russet potatoes.

98
00:04:00,074 --> 00:04:01,306
So what I'm gonna do.

99
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:03,242
There's a key
of where I want to slice these.

100
00:04:03,244 --> 00:04:05,644
Okay.
If I slice 'em like this,

101
00:04:05,646 --> 00:04:07,613
then I'm gonna
get these really flat boats.

102
00:04:07,615 --> 00:04:10,482
What I want to do
is slice 'em on the flat.

103
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:11,617
Okay.

104
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:13,385
Like so.

105
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:15,621
Take 'em on the flat like this,

106
00:04:15,623 --> 00:04:20,058
carve into them,
leaving about a 1/4 inch...

107
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,727
Leaving about a 1/4 inch

108
00:04:21,729 --> 00:04:24,930
of the flesh around there
so they don't become too thin.

109
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:26,632
Because what's gonna happen is,

110
00:04:26,634 --> 00:04:29,568
after I take all this flesh
out of them,

111
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:30,669
let them cool down a bit.

112
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:31,837
Then I'm gonna deep fry 'em.

113
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:33,572
What do you think of that?

114
00:04:42,216 --> 00:04:44,650
All right.
And the last one.

115
00:04:44,652 --> 00:04:47,219
Now, these potatoes
are still a little bit warm,

116
00:04:47,221 --> 00:04:49,321
so I'm gonna
let 'em cool down here a bit.

117
00:04:49,323 --> 00:04:51,123
And you got to save
those potato innards.

118
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,624
I mean,
you're talking potato pancakes.

119
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,259
You got all kinds
of options there.

120
00:04:54,261 --> 00:04:55,794
All right.
So let me do this first.

121
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:57,195
Um, the Guaji...

122
00:04:57,197 --> 00:04:59,865
The... the peppers over here
have really toasted up nice.

123
00:04:59,867 --> 00:05:01,433
I don't want 'em to burn.

124
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:03,835
So now, I'm gonna reconstitute
'em with just a little bit

125
00:05:03,837 --> 00:05:05,570
of hot water.
Okay.

126
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:08,974
I'm gonna
do it right there in that pan.

127
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:12,978
That is a hot pan.

128
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,446
Little more water.

129
00:05:14,448 --> 00:05:16,248
And we'll just let those kind
of hang out for a second.

130
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,917
And those are gonna go directly
into the chili in just a minute.

131
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:20,819
Speaking of the chili,
I need to get those peppers

132
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:22,621
and onions out of there

133
00:05:22,623 --> 00:05:26,858
because now I have got
some top round

134
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:27,959
that I want to brown off.

135
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:28,994
And we're talking about...

136
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:30,128
I don't want it
to be interrupted.

137
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,797
I really want to build
some crust,

138
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:33,398
kind of like we're searing
a short rib.

139
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,867
So what I want to do
is get all these out

140
00:05:35,869 --> 00:05:37,636
'cause you leave just a little
bit of this in there,

141
00:05:37,638 --> 00:05:38,704
there's a lot of moisture.

142
00:05:38,706 --> 00:05:39,905
It will keep it from...

143
00:05:39,907 --> 00:05:42,407
It'll keep the meat
from really browning up.

144
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:45,243
It's just chasing these around
inside of here.

145
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:47,179
There we go.
Okay.

146
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:49,614
Over here.
Let that continue to stay hot.

147
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:51,016
We'll go over here.
There's ground beef.

148
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:52,284
But right now, the roast.

149
00:05:52,286 --> 00:05:53,552
Now, this is a great thing.

150
00:05:53,554 --> 00:05:55,887
We're talking about stew meat
right here.

151
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:57,255
We're talk... Look at that.

152
00:05:57,257 --> 00:05:58,423
Look how beautiful.

153
00:05:58,425 --> 00:06:00,025
Huh?

154
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:02,160
So we'll just hit it
with a little...

155
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:04,629
A little touch of some salt.

156
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:06,164
And we'll just drop it...

157
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,966
Crank that pan back up.

158
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:10,302
Right back in.

159
00:06:10,304 --> 00:06:11,403
There we go.

160
00:06:11,405 --> 00:06:12,904
Nice little sear gonna
happen to that.

161
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:14,072
Now, I also
have some ground beef

162
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:15,140
that I'll put in
in a little bit.

163
00:06:15,142 --> 00:06:16,775
I like to have
two of the textures.

164
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:18,610
This is gonna
be really nice and chewy.

165
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:20,812
It's got some real,
great steak-feel to it.

166
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:22,013
But it will be super tender.

167
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:23,482
And then, that ground beef.

168
00:06:23,484 --> 00:06:25,650
Well, that just kind of works
its way around all the peppers

169
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:27,886
and all that sauce
that's gonna be happening.

170
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:29,955
Okay.
We'll let that brown up.

171
00:06:29,957 --> 00:06:31,957
Now, the skins.

172
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:33,458
What's gonna happen with these?

173
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:36,027
Well, what I'm gonna do is I got
a little bit of the texture,

174
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:37,596
little bit of potato
left on the inside.

175
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:40,198
Drop 'em in at about 350.

176
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,366
And here's the beauty
with these.

177
00:06:41,368 --> 00:06:43,068
We're gonna stuff 'em.
Oh, yeah.

178
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:46,371
So, I want you to think about
a gigantic hollow french fry

179
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:48,006
that we're gonna jam
some prosciutto in,

180
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:49,508
some brie, some mushrooms.

181
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,976
I mean, the list goes on and on.

182
00:06:50,978 --> 00:06:53,278
So let me put these down.
You guys come back.

183
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,013
We'll continue
to work on the chili.

184
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:57,215
We got so many
big flavors going on.

185
00:06:57,217 --> 00:06:59,718
And this is
all for that big game day feast.

186
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,786
See you in a bit.

187
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:54,326
So it's game day feast

188
00:09:54,328 --> 00:09:56,161
here at the Fieri house,
in the backyard.

189
00:09:56,163 --> 00:09:59,331
And yes, game day
and leeks do go hand-in-hand.

190
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:01,733
I've got some leeks
that I'm gonna be sautéing,

191
00:10:01,735 --> 00:10:04,135
here in a second,
with some cremini mushrooms.

192
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:06,638
But, uh, I'll show you
this little leek technique.

193
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,507
Remember when the leek grows,
it's growing up like this.

194
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:10,842
So the opportunity for sand

195
00:10:10,844 --> 00:10:13,244
and dirt and everything
to fall down into those crevices

196
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:15,780
is really,
uh, is really, uh, happening.

197
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:18,416
So what we want to do
is I cut mine.

198
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:20,452
Makes it a little
bit easier to clean.

199
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:22,654
And then, I'll just give 'em
a quick little chop,

200
00:10:22,656 --> 00:10:23,922
drop 'em into the water.

201
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:25,824
I can swirl 'em around
with my hand

202
00:10:25,826 --> 00:10:27,492
and just kind of wash
'em like that,

203
00:10:27,494 --> 00:10:29,761
or rinse 'em, I should say.

204
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:32,464
Some people leave the rounds
together, but what I find is

205
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:35,133
that if they... the rounds don't
get completely broken apart,

206
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,435
you have a chance
of getting yourself some sand

207
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:38,803
and some dirt into it.

208
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:41,606
So this is all gonna come
together.

209
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:42,841
Well, I'll just do it
with my hand.

210
00:10:42,843 --> 00:10:44,042
This is all gonna come together

211
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:46,478
for a fantastic
stuffed potato skin.

212
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,413
And, actually, I've got to drop
some of the potato skins.

213
00:10:48,415 --> 00:10:50,782
So let me let this settle
down here for a second.

214
00:10:50,784 --> 00:10:54,519
Some baked potatoes just left
with about a 1/4 inch, uh,

215
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:55,754
interior right there.

216
00:10:55,756 --> 00:10:57,922
Salted them
before I roasted 'em.

217
00:10:57,924 --> 00:11:00,425
And we'll drop 'em
in 350-degree oil.

218
00:11:00,427 --> 00:11:02,727
And yes,
I want these to almost get

219
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:05,263
like a hollowed-out french fry.

220
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:06,765
Okay.
Almost potato chip-like

221
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:09,534
because we're gonna be throwing
in some brie cheese, prosciutto,

222
00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:10,869
and some mushrooms and all that.

223
00:11:10,871 --> 00:11:12,270
And speaking of which,
I need to get

224
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:14,572
my leeks going here in a second.

225
00:11:14,574 --> 00:11:17,609
So couple tablespoons of butter.

226
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:24,082
And I'm just gonna
shake the leeks off.

227
00:11:26,053 --> 00:11:27,619
Drop 'em in the butter.
And I have some ground beef

228
00:11:27,621 --> 00:11:30,955
going over here
with some 1-inch cubes of chuck.

229
00:11:30,957 --> 00:11:32,290
And I cooked those in the oil

230
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:34,959
that I had just sweated
some peppers and onions in.

231
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:37,862
And in we'll go with the leeks.

232
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:39,264
And then, over there, also,

233
00:11:39,266 --> 00:11:42,267
I have some steeped peppers
that I kind of toasted off a bit

234
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:44,769
to get nice and,
uh, well, nice and rustic

235
00:11:44,771 --> 00:11:46,671
because we're making
Texas-style chili.

236
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:49,174
No beans and no...
And no tomatoes.

237
00:11:49,176 --> 00:11:50,175
Okay.

238
00:11:50,177 --> 00:11:53,011
Drop these in.

239
00:11:53,013 --> 00:11:54,145
Set this aside.

240
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:56,214
Creminis, my favorite.

241
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:57,716
I'm telling you,
one of my favorite mushrooms.

242
00:11:57,718 --> 00:12:00,051
I can't say
it's absolutely my favorite,

243
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:02,987
but it definitely is one
of the best.

244
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:04,689
Really nice and meaty.

245
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:07,826
Lots of really defined
mushroom flavor.

246
00:12:07,828 --> 00:12:10,462
And we're gonna cook
these down with these leeks.

247
00:12:10,464 --> 00:12:11,996
It'll work out perfectly.

248
00:12:19,506 --> 00:12:21,639
All right.
That's enough.

249
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:23,475
Okay.

250
00:12:27,781 --> 00:12:30,515
Bring it right over.
Drop these in.

251
00:12:30,517 --> 00:12:31,516
And you know
what this needs here?

252
00:12:31,518 --> 00:12:34,018
Is just a little touch of thyme.

253
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:37,889
I got some fresh thyme
standing by.

254
00:12:37,891 --> 00:12:39,424
That's all gonna cook
down together.

255
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:41,092
Throw a little more heat on it.

256
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:45,897
And all the thyme
comes out together.

257
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:47,398
And just the leaves
of the thyme.

258
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,867
Okay.
I know this seems

259
00:12:48,869 --> 00:12:51,569
a little bit more refined than
you're thinking game day food.

260
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:53,471
But, you know,
when you say potato skin

261
00:12:53,473 --> 00:12:55,673
and then you say, "But I'm
stuffing it with mushrooms,

262
00:12:55,675 --> 00:12:57,642
and brie and prosciutto," you
can get away with it.

263
00:12:57,644 --> 00:12:58,743
All right.
Now, back over here.

264
00:12:58,745 --> 00:13:00,411
Let's take a look at this.

265
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:02,981
The meat looks great, getting
a nice little brown to it.

266
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:05,049
That's what I was trying
to achieve with that is

267
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:07,185
just get a little crust on it.
Okay.

268
00:13:07,187 --> 00:13:08,386
What does it need?

269
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:11,923
Well, it needs a little bit
of this garlic.

270
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:14,826
I held out on the garlic
till the last moment

271
00:13:14,828 --> 00:13:17,929
because I didn't want
it to burn.

272
00:13:17,931 --> 00:13:20,165
And I got to get
these peppers in.

273
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:23,802
Let's get over to these peppers.

274
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:25,170
Ow, hot handle.

275
00:13:25,172 --> 00:13:27,338
And I want that liquid and all.

276
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:32,076
So I have these reconstituted
Guajillos,

277
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:35,613
Chile de arbol and anchos.

278
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,782
Okay.

279
00:13:37,784 --> 00:13:39,217
Hit that.

280
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:41,085
Little bit of power.

281
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:42,854
Puree it.

282
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:53,164
There we go.

283
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,133
We'll dump this right in here
on with the meat,

284
00:13:55,135 --> 00:13:56,734
in with that garlic
that I just added.

285
00:13:56,736 --> 00:13:58,903
That's where your real
flavor's coming from.

286
00:13:58,905 --> 00:14:01,206
So you look at this and you
go, "Well, it's red like chili,

287
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:03,341
but there's no tomato in it?"
Nope.

288
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:05,977
No tomato.

289
00:14:05,979 --> 00:14:08,112
There we go.
Let me drop this in.

290
00:14:08,114 --> 00:14:11,549
Sweated peppers and onions
that we had from earlier.

291
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:13,251
And that all gets mixed
together.

292
00:14:13,253 --> 00:14:14,986
Look at that.
Look... Just...

293
00:14:14,988 --> 00:14:17,055
I mean, take a look inside this.
Now...

294
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:19,624
Now it's time to go build
another layer of seasoning.

295
00:14:19,626 --> 00:14:21,960
So I've done some salt
and pepper.

296
00:14:21,962 --> 00:14:23,761
Got the peppers and the garlic.

297
00:14:23,763 --> 00:14:27,065
Now we'll do a touch
of Cayenne.

298
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:28,900
A little oregano.

299
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:30,335
A little bit of cumin.

300
00:14:30,337 --> 00:14:32,136
Got to have a little kiss
of cinnamon.

301
00:14:32,138 --> 00:14:34,205
Not too much of it.
Just a touch.

302
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:36,808
Now, this all gets mixed
together

303
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:39,911
and really gonna
build a big base flavor.

304
00:14:39,913 --> 00:14:41,379
But I've got to get some liquid
in here

305
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,081
to help cook down that meat.

306
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,549
So we'll get in here.

307
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:47,085
2 quarts of beef stock.
We're gonna let this go in here.

308
00:14:47,087 --> 00:14:49,287
It's gonna cook down, believe it
or not, for two hours.

309
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:50,755
So I've got my creminis

310
00:14:50,757 --> 00:14:53,491
and my leeks getting ready to go
for my stuffed potato skins.

311
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:55,426
And my potato skins
are just finishing up now.

312
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:57,495
Here's chili.
Cheese sauce coming up.

313
00:14:57,497 --> 00:14:59,063
It's game day feast.

314
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:00,832
And this is exactly
how I like to do it.

315
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:01,933
See you in a little bit.

316
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:12,644
Welcome back to "Big Bite."

317
00:15:12,646 --> 00:15:13,811
Oh, man, I'm telling you,

318
00:15:13,813 --> 00:15:15,546
it's all coming together,
finally.

319
00:15:15,548 --> 00:15:16,981
Yes, I'm browning the butter.

320
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:18,116
That's what you expect to find

321
00:15:18,118 --> 00:15:19,717
on a game day feast
at the Fieri house.

322
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:22,086
Now, I'm actually making
some roux because I'm gonna

323
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:25,123
make some beer cheddar
cheese sauce for my chili.

324
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:30,595
So, just a little bit of flour
to go with that butter.

325
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:33,164
Make a quick little roux.

326
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,199
Basically, equal parts.

327
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:37,402
Let's see where that gets us.

328
00:15:37,404 --> 00:15:38,703
There we go.

329
00:15:38,705 --> 00:15:40,638
Toast it off.
There you are.

330
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,274
What do you have back here
in this cauldron of fun?

331
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,410
Well, you've got
some Texas-style chili.

332
00:15:45,412 --> 00:15:46,811
All that beautiful red color,

333
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:48,246
not coming from tomatoes.
Nope.

334
00:15:48,248 --> 00:15:51,916
We've got a bunch of,
uh, Guajillo peppers, ancho,

335
00:15:51,918 --> 00:15:53,217
little Chile de arbol.

336
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:54,652
We got some poblanos.

337
00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:56,821
We got some onions, some garlic
and, then, some stew beef,

338
00:15:56,823 --> 00:15:59,090
some ground beef, uh,
all coming together.

339
00:15:59,092 --> 00:16:01,192
It is gonna be quite fantastic.

340
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:02,727
And then, right here, well,

341
00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:06,431
some mushrooms and leeks
to go in our stuffed potatoes.

342
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:07,966
So these are actually
potato skins.

343
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:10,468
Took some baked potatoes,
scooped 'em out, fried 'em.

344
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,836
Nice and crunchy.
Look at that.

345
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:14,639
Almost like a, uh, cross
between a hollow french fry

346
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:16,341
and a potato chip.
Gonna go in there.

347
00:16:16,343 --> 00:16:17,675
I'll get to that in a second.

348
00:16:17,677 --> 00:16:25,283
But in the meantime,
we need to get a little beer.

349
00:16:25,285 --> 00:16:27,819
Beer cheddar cheese sauce.

350
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:30,221
I mean, I like a cheese sauce
like anybody does,

351
00:16:30,223 --> 00:16:31,990
but when you're gonna make it

352
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:35,560
and it's standing up
against big flavors like, uh,

353
00:16:35,562 --> 00:16:37,962
a Texas-style chili, you can't
just go out of the can

354
00:16:37,964 --> 00:16:39,263
with this one.

355
00:16:39,265 --> 00:16:41,933
So start with a roux,
simple 50-50 of fat and flour...

356
00:16:41,935 --> 00:16:43,701
Butter and flour,
a little half-and-half.

357
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:45,036
Not too much half-and-half

358
00:16:45,038 --> 00:16:46,504
'cause we're adding in
a full beer.

359
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:49,474
Nice amber beer so you're gonna
get that deep, rich beer flavor.

360
00:16:49,476 --> 00:16:50,808
Dropping in some sharp cheddar,

361
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,577
grated, slowly,
little bit at a time

362
00:16:52,579 --> 00:16:55,546
so it doesn't seize up
and get into that cheese ball.

363
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:57,248
A little touch of Cayenne.

364
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,383
And then,
this is where the flavors

365
00:16:58,385 --> 00:16:59,984
get a little bit funky.
Dry mustard.

366
00:16:59,986 --> 00:17:03,788
Got to have that little tang
in there from the dry mustard.

367
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,690
A little bit of Worcestershire.

368
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:09,027
A little touch of paprika.
There we are.

369
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:10,828
Stir in a little bit more
of this,

370
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:12,130
and I got one more cheese

371
00:17:12,132 --> 00:17:15,266
to add to this to make
it really nice and velvety.

372
00:17:15,268 --> 00:17:17,201
And that will be...

373
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:20,304
Exactly. Cream cheese.
Okay.

374
00:17:20,306 --> 00:17:22,373
I'll let that go.

375
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,343
Get some cream cheese.

376
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:27,545
I said, "Game day food."
I did not say,

377
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:29,447
"This is the health show."
Okay.

378
00:17:29,449 --> 00:17:30,982
So we've got cream cheese.

379
00:17:30,984 --> 00:17:33,184
We got beer.
We've got chili.

380
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:35,153
We'll lay that right
in like that.

381
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:36,187
Let it cook down.

382
00:17:36,189 --> 00:17:37,488
Don't let it burn.

383
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:40,324
And that can compete
and stand up to that big, uh,

384
00:17:40,326 --> 00:17:42,093
that big Texas chili.
Okay.

385
00:17:42,095 --> 00:17:45,196
Let me get a little
"S" and "P" into this.

386
00:17:45,198 --> 00:17:46,964
And we'll just let
this go low-and-slow

387
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:49,333
until it breaks up
that cream cheese.

388
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:50,501
There we go.
Okay.

389
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:52,070
Let me talk
about this chili real quick.

390
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:54,639
The chili, I mean, this has got
a super, important role in this

391
00:17:54,641 --> 00:17:56,140
because we can stuff the chili

392
00:17:56,142 --> 00:17:57,341
into these, uh, potato skins.

393
00:17:57,343 --> 00:17:58,810
There's a lot that could happen.

394
00:17:58,812 --> 00:18:03,214
But what I want to do right now
is pour myself an ice cold beer.

395
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:05,216
I want to get a little bit
of beer,

396
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:07,552
and I want to get a little bit
of masa, masa harina.

397
00:18:07,554 --> 00:18:10,621
This is what you'd make,
uh, tamales or tortillas with.

398
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:11,889
If you don't have masa,

399
00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:13,424
don't worry about running out
to go grab it.

400
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:16,527
All you're gonna need to do
is use some regular flour.

401
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:18,696
But I'm just gonna
cut it a little bit into this

402
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:20,031
so it doesn't clump up on me

403
00:18:20,033 --> 00:18:21,399
when I drop it in there.

404
00:18:21,401 --> 00:18:24,268
So maybe...
that's 2 big tablespoons.

405
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,603
Okay.

406
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:29,073
And I also
want to add just a touch.

407
00:18:29,075 --> 00:18:30,141
Whoa.

408
00:18:30,143 --> 00:18:31,175
Did I get that on me?

409
00:18:31,177 --> 00:18:33,411
A little bit of paprika.

410
00:18:33,413 --> 00:18:35,680
There we go.

411
00:18:35,682 --> 00:18:37,949
Excellent.
Okay.

412
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:40,852
So we're gonna mix this up.
It's kind of dissolved there,

413
00:18:40,854 --> 00:18:42,086
kind of like you're making
a slurry.

414
00:18:42,088 --> 00:18:43,488
You get the idea.

415
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,022
I'm gonna turn that heat
down a little bit.

416
00:18:45,024 --> 00:18:46,290
That thing's rolling hard.

417
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,192
Takes about two hours
for that really to reduce.

418
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:52,730
We have 2 quarts of beef stock
that went into it.

419
00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:57,101
So we'll just slowly
incorporate this in.

420
00:18:57,103 --> 00:18:59,237
And this is gonna work
as an awesome thickener.

421
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:02,240
It kind of plays
right into the theme of Texas,

422
00:19:02,242 --> 00:19:04,208
and chili and Tex-Mex.

423
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:05,943
Some nice beer flavor into that.

424
00:19:05,945 --> 00:19:08,412
And, again, no tomatoes,
no beans.

425
00:19:08,414 --> 00:19:11,782
All right. There we go.
Okay.

426
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:13,351
So this is starting
to melt down nice.

427
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:15,620
You'll see a nice little cheese
sauce coming out of that.

428
00:19:15,622 --> 00:19:16,954
So while that is melting,

429
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:20,291
let's get over here
and talk about these skins.

430
00:19:20,293 --> 00:19:22,860
Now, the skins, like I said,

431
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:25,129
"You have leftover potatoes.

432
00:19:25,131 --> 00:19:26,564
What are you gonna do
with them?"

433
00:19:26,566 --> 00:19:28,466
Well, we're gonna take...

434
00:19:28,468 --> 00:19:31,936
Put a little bit of mushroom
mixture in there with the leeks.

435
00:19:31,938 --> 00:19:33,638
Okay.

436
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,940
We'll peel off...

437
00:19:35,942 --> 00:19:37,175
There you go.
This is...

438
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:38,776
When you think "Game Day"
at my house, you think,

439
00:19:38,778 --> 00:19:41,879
"Of course,
there's gonna be a little brie."

440
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:44,282
So we'll crumble a little brie
in there.

441
00:19:44,284 --> 00:19:46,250
And then, what would be
the next thought...

442
00:19:46,252 --> 00:19:47,685
"Okay, yeah. Prosciutto."

443
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:50,121
There's gonna be
some Italian cold-cuts for sure.

444
00:19:50,123 --> 00:19:52,723
So look at this.
There you go.

445
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:55,826
Some nice prosciutto,
thinly sliced.

446
00:19:55,828 --> 00:19:58,596
We'll just tear off
a few pieces.

447
00:19:58,598 --> 00:19:59,964
Lay it right up on top.

448
00:19:59,966 --> 00:20:01,799
That'll get nice and crusty,
kind of like bacon.

449
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:03,267
So I'll knock these out.

450
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:04,969
Fill 'em up.
Pop 'em in the oven.

451
00:20:04,971 --> 00:20:06,504
Let 'em melt one more time.

452
00:20:06,506 --> 00:20:07,772
Cheese sauce will be done.

453
00:20:07,774 --> 00:20:08,973
The chili's thickening up.

454
00:20:08,975 --> 00:20:10,575
When you come back,
it's game day.

455
00:20:10,577 --> 00:20:12,143
I don't know who's playing,
but it doesn't matter

456
00:20:12,145 --> 00:20:14,212
because this is gonna
be a feast.

457
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:15,446
See you in a little bit.

458
00:20:24,257 --> 00:20:25,456
Whoa.
Coming over hot.

459
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:28,292
Look at those bad boys.
Huh?

460
00:20:28,294 --> 00:20:30,895
That's potato skins
like you've never seen before.

461
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:32,096
Cooked these potatoes.

462
00:20:32,098 --> 00:20:33,931
Scooped 'em out.
Deep fried 'em.

463
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:35,866
Filled 'em with some cremini
mushrooms, some...

464
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:37,235
And some, uh, leeks.

465
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:39,704
Then a little brie, of course.
Isn't it tailgate time?

466
00:20:39,706 --> 00:20:41,439
No?
And a little prosciutto.

467
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:42,907
That's exactly how we do it
at the Fieri house.

468
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:44,775
Some cheese sauce
made with some beer

469
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:46,577
and some cheddar
and a little cream cheese.

470
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:49,313
And then the star of the show...
Let me turn down some heat.

471
00:20:49,315 --> 00:20:50,715
The start of the show...

472
00:20:50,717 --> 00:20:53,751
This true Texas-style chili.

473
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:55,152
You see that beautiful red hue.

474
00:20:55,154 --> 00:20:57,455
There's no tomatoes in that.
There's no beans.

475
00:20:57,457 --> 00:21:03,761
But there is a mess
of hot peppers, fresh peppers.

476
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:05,396
We got a little bit of garlic.

477
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:06,631
We got beer.

478
00:21:06,633 --> 00:21:09,634
We got a little masa harina
to tighten it up.

479
00:21:09,636 --> 00:21:12,270
And you take a look at that,
ladies and gentlemen.

480
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:15,072
Tell me that is not gorgeous.

481
00:21:15,074 --> 00:21:16,340
Fantastic.

482
00:21:16,342 --> 00:21:18,276
Grab one of these bad boys.

483
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:19,477
Drop it down.

484
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:22,446
Got myself a cold beer.

485
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:24,282
I'm just tasting,
just doing a little pre-party.

486
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:26,450
Don't... don't worry about this.
Okay.

487
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:29,787
Now, get a little dollop
of some sour cream.

488
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:33,791
Personally, I'm into, uh,
some red onions.

489
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:35,860
Oh, you know
what I need back here?

490
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:41,465
Let me get some chives.

491
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:43,167
Okay.

492
00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:45,670
Sprinkle those over the top.

493
00:21:45,672 --> 00:21:47,471
And a little scallion.

494
00:21:55,715 --> 00:21:59,617
Not showing off, just hungry.
Okay.

495
00:21:59,619 --> 00:22:01,285
Right on top there.

496
00:22:01,287 --> 00:22:02,453
Excellent.

497
00:22:02,455 --> 00:22:05,256
I get myself a couple crackers.

498
00:22:05,258 --> 00:22:06,724
Drop 'em right on.

499
00:22:06,726 --> 00:22:09,060
This is coming together.
Now, look at that.

500
00:22:09,062 --> 00:22:11,362
All that beautiful red color.

501
00:22:16,703 --> 00:22:17,835
Mm. It's totally missing
something...

502
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:20,404
Cheddar cheese sauce.

503
00:22:20,406 --> 00:22:23,040
What am I thinking?
This is the whole...

504
00:22:23,042 --> 00:22:25,242
This is how I got
the whole party started.

505
00:22:25,244 --> 00:22:27,778
Look at that.

506
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:30,381
There we go.

507
00:22:30,383 --> 00:22:35,920
So sour cream, the scallions,
the onions, the crackers

508
00:22:35,922 --> 00:22:39,957
and this beautiful red chili
that has no tomato or beans.

509
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:44,462
Mm.

510
00:22:44,464 --> 00:22:46,430
Deep, rich flavor.

511
00:22:46,432 --> 00:22:49,033
Tighten it up just a little bit
with that masa,

512
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:51,068
that tortilla flour,
right in there.

513
00:22:53,172 --> 00:22:54,538
Mm.

514
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,940
And the cheese sauce,
man, I'm telling you,

515
00:22:55,942 --> 00:22:57,041
you make that roux.

516
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:58,542
Get a little bit
of that half-and-half,

517
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:00,911
but then stopped it and hit
the rest of it with that beer,

518
00:23:00,913 --> 00:23:02,346
with that nice little
amber beer,

519
00:23:02,348 --> 00:23:05,416
you're really getting
that cheese to come through.

520
00:23:05,418 --> 00:23:07,852
Mm.

521
00:23:07,854 --> 00:23:08,953
And then, this right here.

522
00:23:08,955 --> 00:23:10,755
I mean, I think
you say potato skin,

523
00:23:10,757 --> 00:23:12,390
people are expecting
that I fill it with the chili

524
00:23:12,392 --> 00:23:13,891
and hit it
with the cheese sauce,

525
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:15,760
which isn't a bad idea.
But look at this.

526
00:23:15,762 --> 00:23:18,629
Mushrooms, brie, prosciutto.

527
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:27,438
A little kiss of the leeks
in there, chives on top.

528
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,839
Game day?

529
00:23:28,841 --> 00:23:30,641
It looks like wedding food.
Isn't it?

530
00:23:30,643 --> 00:23:31,742
Well, it depends on the wedding.

531
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:32,877
Listen.
You want to get this recipe?

532
00:23:32,879 --> 00:23:35,312
'Cause I know you do.

533
00:23:35,314 --> 00:23:37,982
You know the deal...
Foodnetwork.com/guysbigbite.

534
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:40,418
Hanging out in the backyard,
and I'll see you next week.

                     ♪♪

2
00:00:16,684 --> 00:00:16,084
     Welcome to "Big Bite."

3
00:00:16,084 --> 00:00:16,084
 You know, during the holidays,

4
00:00:17,585 --> 00:00:16,985
 you can expect three things to
 happen here at the Fieri house.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,201
   One -- we will have no snow
   'cause we're in California.

6
00:00:20,203 --> 00:00:21,669
      Two -- there will be
        a lot of laughs.

7
00:00:21,671 --> 00:00:23,905
     There's a lot of laughs
 when my family comes together.

8
00:00:23,907 --> 00:00:27,675
 And three -- without question,
   we will eat Dungeness crab,

9
00:00:27,677 --> 00:00:30,245
       I mean, in any way,
  shape, or form we can get it.

10
00:00:30,247 --> 00:00:33,248
So that's what we're gonna do is
 an old classic with a new spin,

11
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,750
        starting off with
  my grilled seafood cioppino.

12
00:00:35,752 --> 00:00:38,853
      Packed with beautiful
  Dungeness crab, sea scallops,

13
00:00:38,855 --> 00:00:41,890
   halibut, and jumbo shrimp,
    all served with a smokey,

14
00:00:41,892 --> 00:00:44,359
       fire-roasted tomato
      and vegetable puree,

15
00:00:44,361 --> 00:00:46,961
       and grilled polenta
   with peppers and Pecorino.

16
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:49,097
        It's got flavor.
        It's got texture.

17
00:00:49,099 --> 00:00:51,733
   And it's the perfect thing
 to round out this holiday meal.

18
00:00:51,735 --> 00:00:54,536
  So, lemon juice, tons of it,

19
00:00:54,538 --> 00:00:56,538
   because, believe it or not,
 I'm gonna marinate the seafood,

20
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,039
       which I'll get into
        in just a second,

21
00:00:58,041 --> 00:00:59,407
      but I had to get this
      out of the way 'cause

22
00:00:59,409 --> 00:01:00,975
      nothing more exciting
     than just sitting here

23
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:03,311
     and squeezing all this
    lemon juice by yourself.

24
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,413
  Let's talk about the polenta
        and the peppers.

25
00:01:05,415 --> 00:01:07,682
           Hang tight.

26
00:01:07,684 --> 00:01:12,387
Couple red and a couple Anaheim,

27
00:01:12,389 --> 00:01:15,290
   and this is gonna be great
 flavor, as well as great color.

28
00:01:15,292 --> 00:01:17,225
   And I'll tell you one thing
      we love around here,

29
00:01:17,227 --> 00:01:18,393
          it's polenta.

30
00:01:18,395 --> 00:01:19,694
         I mean, it's --
    I don't know what it is.

31
00:01:19,696 --> 00:01:21,095
It's something about being warm.

32
00:01:21,097 --> 00:01:22,363
         It's something
       about being thick.

33
00:01:22,365 --> 00:01:23,865
         It's something
  about the fact I love grits.

34
00:01:23,867 --> 00:01:25,767
          I don't know,
      but polenta plays in.

35
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:28,403
   A little bit of olive oil,

36
00:01:28,405 --> 00:01:31,105
    a little salt and pepper
 to that, and a super hot grill.

37
00:01:31,107 --> 00:01:32,373
              Okay.

38
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:36,077
    And all I'm gonna do here
       is roast these off

39
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,247
  and then take 'em, throw 'em
  back in this bowl, sweat 'em,

40
00:01:39,249 --> 00:01:41,115
         and then later,
       I'll take the seeds

41
00:01:41,117 --> 00:01:42,183
and the skins and the stems off.

42
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:43,918
              Okay?
Ready for the start of the show?

43
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,019
           Hang tight.

44
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:47,288
            Seafood.

45
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:50,758
       This is the bounty
         of the county.

46
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,093
               Oh.

47
00:01:52,095 --> 00:01:54,228
              Huh?
          Look at that.

48
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:56,698
   Now I said that, you know,
    the crab, the Dungeness,

49
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,166
   that's the big player here,

50
00:01:58,168 --> 00:02:01,035
 but I had to go grab everything
  they had down at the market.

51
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:02,804
 So, first, the Dungeness crab.

52
00:02:02,806 --> 00:02:05,573
   Now they have been cleaned,
  but I like to keep the shell

53
00:02:05,575 --> 00:02:07,709
         just because it
   makes a nice presentation.

54
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:09,243
    So you've these beautiful
         Dungeness crab.

55
00:02:09,245 --> 00:02:11,379
   And this is really the king
  of the crab, in our opinion,

56
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:12,680
  here in Northern California.

57
00:02:12,682 --> 00:02:14,782
  We're talking about buttery,
           sweet meat.

58
00:02:14,784 --> 00:02:16,184
         You're getting
      a really good yield.

59
00:02:16,186 --> 00:02:17,719
      You get a ton of crab
          out of this.

60
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:21,456
All that body meat is fantastic,
  and, putting it on the grill,

61
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:23,424
     I know it sounds crazy,
    but you're gonna love it.

62
00:02:23,426 --> 00:02:24,859
      Then we have some big
          jumbo prawns.

63
00:02:24,861 --> 00:02:26,160
 These are like four to a pound.

64
00:02:26,162 --> 00:02:28,029
         And anytime you
  can grill it with a shell on,

65
00:02:28,031 --> 00:02:29,163
  we know that's great flavor,

66
00:02:29,165 --> 00:02:31,099
      but then to grill it
        with the head on?

67
00:02:31,101 --> 00:02:32,333
  Not only is the presentation
            awesome,

68
00:02:32,335 --> 00:02:33,635
   but the flavor goes crazy.

69
00:02:33,637 --> 00:02:34,836
     And then some halibut.

70
00:02:34,838 --> 00:02:36,170
    You can use whatever type
        of fish you want,

71
00:02:36,172 --> 00:02:39,040
   but I'm looking for a nice,
        firm white fish.

72
00:02:39,042 --> 00:02:41,643
      Typically, a cioppino
     is cooked in the sauce,

73
00:02:41,645 --> 00:02:43,845
    all the seafood goes into
  the sauce at different times.

74
00:02:43,847 --> 00:02:46,614
   But we're gonna grill this.
   Just grill it to perfection

75
00:02:46,616 --> 00:02:48,850
         and then add it
     to this grilled sauce.

76
00:02:48,852 --> 00:02:50,318
           Outrageous.
  And then scallops, of course.

77
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,453
I mean, look at these beautiful,
       big, fat scallops,

78
00:02:52,455 --> 00:02:54,822
      and we're gonna do it
 on a hot grill, just gonna sear

79
00:02:54,824 --> 00:02:56,224
        'em a little bit.
           Fantastic.

80
00:02:56,226 --> 00:02:58,459
         But let's talk
      about this marinade.

81
00:02:58,461 --> 00:03:01,062
        A monster bowl...

82
00:03:01,064 --> 00:03:03,898
   a bounty of lemon juice...

83
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:04,999
           some salt.

84
00:03:05,001 --> 00:03:06,434
   Don't have to go too heavy
          on the salt.

85
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:07,869
         Granted, it all
      came out of the sea.

86
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:09,237
          Black pepper.

87
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:11,339
           Just get in
      with a little garlic.

88
00:03:11,341 --> 00:03:15,276
  And I'm just gonna rough chop
          that garlic.

89
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:16,344
      This will break down.

90
00:03:16,346 --> 00:03:18,346
     It'll share its flavor.

91
00:03:21,751 --> 00:03:25,520
      A little white wine.

92
00:03:25,522 --> 00:03:28,356
 And another one of my favorites
    when it comes to seafood

93
00:03:28,358 --> 00:03:29,824
         is some capers.

94
00:03:29,826 --> 00:03:31,659
       They couldn't make
      the jar any smaller.

95
00:03:31,661 --> 00:03:34,462
     And they start falling
       all over the place.

96
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:35,930
              Okay.

97
00:03:35,932 --> 00:03:38,499
 Just like I do with the garlic,
   just give 'em a little pop,

98
00:03:38,501 --> 00:03:41,436
          just to kind
      of open it up a bit.

99
00:03:41,438 --> 00:03:44,405
    And, last but not least,
     you think of the spice.

100
00:03:44,407 --> 00:03:46,340
         Man, I been to
      some cioppino feeds.

101
00:03:46,342 --> 00:03:48,876
              Whoo!
    I mean, it is all spice.

102
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:53,047
 so we'll just add a little bit
     of chili flake to this.

103
00:03:53,049 --> 00:03:54,816
    And then, to coat it all,

104
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:57,885
  to help all this great flavor
     stick to this seafood,

105
00:03:57,887 --> 00:03:58,986
a little bit of olive oil, okay?

106
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:00,888
 Let me give this a quick whisk.

107
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:07,195
 Now I'll turn this a few times
      as I let it marinate.

108
00:04:07,197 --> 00:04:10,098
      But what we're gonna
          do right now,

109
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:13,134
      we'll drop that nice,
 big piece of halibut in there.

110
00:04:13,136 --> 00:04:15,036
That's what we're talkin' about.

111
00:04:15,038 --> 00:04:18,406
         Then we'll get
       those scallops in.

112
00:04:18,408 --> 00:04:19,807
           Beautiful.

113
00:04:19,809 --> 00:04:21,709
        We'll throw in --
 I'm gonna pop that crab in half

114
00:04:21,711 --> 00:04:24,979
         just like that.

115
00:04:24,981 --> 00:04:26,347
           Excellent.

116
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:29,917
 The other one -- Look at this,
      and this is so fresh.

117
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,620
   There we go, down the side.

118
00:04:32,622 --> 00:04:36,457
   And then we'll throw prawns
  that will take it real quick.

119
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:40,061
 So grab this and a little foil,
       and we'll go back.

120
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:42,964
  'Cause what do you want? You
want your seafood nice and cold.

121
00:04:42,966 --> 00:04:46,868
   We'll throw a little cover
         on top of that.

122
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:51,939
   Now I got to wash my hands.
              Okay?

123
00:04:51,941 --> 00:04:53,841
           All right.

124
00:04:54,844 --> 00:04:57,845
           All right.

125
00:04:57,847 --> 00:05:01,282
  Now keepin' that cold 'cause
   you want that seafood cold,

126
00:05:01,284 --> 00:05:04,218
    just like when you get it
         at the market.

127
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,420
           All right.
Now let's get into some polenta.

128
00:05:06,422 --> 00:05:07,822
 So I've got some boiling water.

129
00:05:07,824 --> 00:05:09,090
       Oh, I forgot a leg.

130
00:05:09,092 --> 00:05:10,158
               Ah.

131
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,994
            One down.

132
00:05:12,996 --> 00:05:14,195
              Okay.

133
00:05:14,197 --> 00:05:17,064
 Let me give these a little turn
           real quick.

134
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:18,533
          That's right.
 That's what we're looking for,

135
00:05:18,535 --> 00:05:20,401
        nice char on 'em.

136
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:23,471
We wanna talk about charring 'em
   but not burning the flesh.

137
00:05:23,473 --> 00:05:25,039
 I don't wanna burn all the way
       through the pepper,

138
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:27,008
       so this is exactly
      where we want to go.

139
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:29,177
And if you don't have an outdoor
 grill, don't worry about that.

140
00:05:29,179 --> 00:05:31,746
     Doing them in the oven,
      super easy way to go.

141
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,115
    4½ cups of boiling water.

142
00:05:34,117 --> 00:05:35,249
       I've got wet hands.

143
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:37,752
      I'm gonna do the salt
          with a spoon,

144
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,420
    and a little bit of salt,

145
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,956
and let's get into some polenta.

146
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:44,492
      Now, polenta, grits,
     call it what you want.

147
00:05:44,494 --> 00:05:46,427
           All I know
    is we're talking creamy.

148
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:48,062
  We're talking great texture.

149
00:05:48,064 --> 00:05:49,964
We're talking an Italian staple.

150
00:05:49,966 --> 00:05:51,332
We're talking a Southern staple,

151
00:05:51,334 --> 00:05:53,267
             my mom
   coming from North Carolina.

152
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:56,103
       So this is perfect
   to play into the holidays.

153
00:05:56,105 --> 00:06:00,575
        About 1 1/2 cups,
      a little bit of salt.

154
00:06:00,577 --> 00:06:07,715
   Just slowly whisk these in,
  not wanting them to clump up.

155
00:06:07,717 --> 00:06:09,217
          There we go.

156
00:06:09,219 --> 00:06:10,518
              Huh?

157
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,886
   Wait till you see what I do
        with these grits.

158
00:06:11,888 --> 00:06:13,221
             Oh-ho.

159
00:06:13,223 --> 00:06:15,723
   This is all about holidays,
     'cause holidays for us,

160
00:06:15,725 --> 00:06:17,225
            you know,
   the kids are out of school,

161
00:06:17,227 --> 00:06:19,493
   lots of family coming over,
        a lot of friends.

162
00:06:19,495 --> 00:06:20,661
           Of course,
     what they're expecting

163
00:06:20,663 --> 00:06:22,630
           is to walk
    into a nice presentation.

164
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:24,966
         Well, I'm gonna
  give 'em that and then some.

165
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:26,234
              Okay.

166
00:06:26,236 --> 00:06:27,335
          There you go.

167
00:06:27,337 --> 00:06:28,769
       Polenta's working.

168
00:06:28,771 --> 00:06:30,638
     I'll grab the peppers,
   wrap 'em with some plastic,

169
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,740
           sweat 'em,
 gonna peel 'em in a little bit.

170
00:06:32,742 --> 00:06:34,475
   The seafood's hanging out.
           Come back.

171
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:38,646
 we're doing a holiday cioppino
    that no one will forget.

172
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:39,647
     See ya in a little bit.

173
00:06:46,456 --> 00:06:47,755
   Welcome back to "Big Bite."

174
00:06:47,757 --> 00:06:49,724
   You don't even have to ask
    what time of year it is.

175
00:06:49,726 --> 00:06:51,726
          You can tell
  from beautiful Dungeness crab

176
00:06:51,728 --> 00:06:54,061
   at the Fieri house that it
   must be around the holidays

177
00:06:54,063 --> 00:06:55,830
          because, man,
   if we're eating one thing,

178
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,164
     we're eating Dungeness.

179
00:06:57,166 --> 00:07:02,169
    So look at this beautiful
  marinating setup I have here.

180
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:05,940
I mean, I've got everything from
 jumbo prawns to Dungeness crab

181
00:07:05,942 --> 00:07:08,309
 to an enormous piece of halibut

182
00:07:08,311 --> 00:07:10,678
        all sitting down
   in this delicious marinade

183
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,115
    of garlic and chili flake
and capers, a lot of white wine,

184
00:07:14,117 --> 00:07:15,383
       a little olive oil,

185
00:07:15,385 --> 00:07:17,451
    and a lot of lemon juice,
      a lot of lemon juice.

186
00:07:17,453 --> 00:07:19,453
      But look at these --
   look at this size scallop.

187
00:07:19,455 --> 00:07:21,756
    Now, I'm making cioppino.
   Now, we all love cioppino.

188
00:07:21,758 --> 00:07:23,324
           We all have
     our favorite cioppino.

189
00:07:23,326 --> 00:07:24,592
      And if you don't know
        what cioppino is,

190
00:07:24,594 --> 00:07:26,827
          we're talking
    about a tomato base stock

191
00:07:26,829 --> 00:07:28,229
  that has fresh seafood in it.

192
00:07:28,231 --> 00:07:29,897
    And they said that it was
 invented here in San Francisco

193
00:07:29,899 --> 00:07:31,132
       about an hour away.

194
00:07:31,134 --> 00:07:32,934
     And the beauty of it is
     is it can kind of take

195
00:07:32,936 --> 00:07:34,201
       on whatever seafood
       you have available.

196
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:36,404
           The key is,
treat the seafood the right way.

197
00:07:36,406 --> 00:07:38,673
           So I've got
  this sitting here marinating.

198
00:07:38,675 --> 00:07:40,741
           And just --
   Ah, it's gonna be fantastic

199
00:07:40,743 --> 00:07:42,443
        because I'm going
     to grill this cioppino.

200
00:07:42,445 --> 00:07:43,778
 I haven't seen it done before.

201
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,680
       I've done cioppino
      on "Big Bite" before,

202
00:07:45,682 --> 00:07:47,348
 but not in the grilled fashion.

203
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:49,417
  And I was out here doin' it,
     I said, "You know what?

204
00:07:49,419 --> 00:07:51,285
  I really wanna get everything
      out of this seafood."

205
00:07:51,287 --> 00:07:53,821
         So to grill it,
I can really watch how it cooks,

206
00:07:53,823 --> 00:07:56,023
    and I don't have it just
     simmering in the sauce,

207
00:07:56,025 --> 00:07:58,392
   but I still make the sauce
   and add it to the seafood.

208
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:02,596
     You're gonna love this.
All right. Let me put this away.

209
00:08:02,598 --> 00:08:06,867
    Keeping the seafood cold.

210
00:08:06,869 --> 00:08:08,703
 And let's get into the polenta.

211
00:08:08,705 --> 00:08:10,071
       That's what's gonna
       go alongside here.

212
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:11,839
       We love our polenta
     around the Fieri house.

213
00:08:11,841 --> 00:08:13,407
           So I've got
     some roasted peppers --

214
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:17,044
    roasted red bell peppers
    and some green Anaheims,

215
00:08:17,046 --> 00:08:19,213
      so just a little bit
       of heat from that.

216
00:08:19,215 --> 00:08:21,615
     A little salt, a little
    olive oil, little pepper,

217
00:08:21,617 --> 00:08:23,250
     threw 'em on the grill,

218
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:27,655
    then threw 'em in a bowl,
 let 'em sweat, cleaned 'em up,

219
00:08:27,657 --> 00:08:30,524
and took the stems and the seeds
   and everything out of 'em.

220
00:08:30,526 --> 00:08:32,693
    And now I'm gonna mix 'em
     into this really nice,

221
00:08:32,695 --> 00:08:39,066
   hearty polenta, lay it out
  on a tray, let it cool a bit.

222
00:08:39,068 --> 00:08:40,601
      And then I'll pop it
         into the oven.

223
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:43,571
   The key is, I'm just gonna
     add a bunch of cheese.

224
00:08:43,573 --> 00:08:45,339
              Okay.

225
00:08:45,341 --> 00:08:47,341
     Lookin' good with that.

226
00:08:47,343 --> 00:08:48,709
        Slide this over.

227
00:08:48,711 --> 00:08:53,481
     Heavy bottom pot always
 helps to not burn the polenta.

228
00:08:53,483 --> 00:08:58,185
    Ton of peppers going in.

229
00:08:58,187 --> 00:08:59,920
              Okay.
Pecorino -- let's talk about it.

230
00:08:59,922 --> 00:09:02,123
      Super nice and salty.

231
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,294
        You can smell it.

232
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:09,296
              Okay.
         So about 1 cup.

233
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:11,032
         Maybe I gave it
      a little extra there.

234
00:09:11,034 --> 00:09:12,566
    Give this a little stir.

235
00:09:12,568 --> 00:09:14,668
          Awesome color
      coming through that.

236
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,170
  I already added a little bit
        of salt to that.

237
00:09:16,172 --> 00:09:17,872
       I have to watch it
     because that cheese --

238
00:09:17,874 --> 00:09:20,474
           that cheese
     itself is pretty salty.

239
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:22,109
              Okay.

240
00:09:22,111 --> 00:09:26,414
    And just a little butter.

241
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:27,748
      It's a warm day here.

242
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,849
   That's how the holidays are

243
00:09:28,851 --> 00:09:30,618
     in Northern California,
         nice and warm.

244
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,554
I'm standing out here in shorts.

245
00:09:33,556 --> 00:09:36,757
         Okay, got that.

246
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:40,694
    Sheet tray, a little bit
          of olive oil,

247
00:09:40,696 --> 00:09:44,131
  cooking spray if you have it,
    just so it doesn't stick.

248
00:09:44,133 --> 00:09:46,567
              Okay.

249
00:09:46,569 --> 00:09:48,569
    Ah, that's what I thought
        was gonna happen.

250
00:09:48,571 --> 00:09:52,706
 Excuse me. We got to break out
       the rubber spatula.

251
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:53,974
        Ah, this is gonna
         be so worth it.

252
00:09:53,976 --> 00:09:56,444
     A lot of steps in this,

253
00:09:56,446 --> 00:09:59,980
     but if you like polenta
    like I do, you'll get it.

254
00:09:59,982 --> 00:10:01,415
              Okay.

255
00:10:01,417 --> 00:10:06,187
    And now we'll just smooth
   it out, still nice and hot.

256
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:07,221
           Fantastic.

257
00:10:07,223 --> 00:10:08,956
              Okay.

258
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:10,124
         Set that aside.

259
00:10:10,126 --> 00:10:11,792
 Now let's talk about the sauce

260
00:10:11,794 --> 00:10:12,960
      that's gonna go with
          the cioppino.

261
00:10:12,962 --> 00:10:14,395
        What do we need?

262
00:10:14,397 --> 00:10:16,163
            Exactly.
     A bunch of vegetables.

263
00:10:16,165 --> 00:10:20,734
        So I'm gonna grab
         the whole bowl.

264
00:10:20,736 --> 00:10:22,369
        Almost gonna use
       every bit of this,

265
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:23,771
     but we'll jump in here.

266
00:10:23,773 --> 00:10:25,039
              Okay.

267
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,341
        Let's take this,
      get that, here we go.

268
00:10:27,343 --> 00:10:30,044
Grab a tray 'cause I'm gonna put
        a little marinade

269
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,712
      on these as we work.

270
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:34,315
       So the first thing
   I'm gonna start off with --

271
00:10:34,317 --> 00:10:38,919
        oh -- is a bunch
        of Roma tomatoes.

272
00:10:38,921 --> 00:10:41,856
                     ♪♪

273
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,261
       Last of the Romas.

274
00:10:47,263 --> 00:10:50,030
  Tomato sauce and cioppino --
          hand in hand.

275
00:10:50,032 --> 00:10:52,099
    Next up, red bell pepper.

276
00:10:56,739 --> 00:11:00,574
Red bell pepper and a big onion.

277
00:11:14,023 --> 00:11:16,991
     One more -- the fennel.

278
00:11:16,993 --> 00:11:19,126
          The key here
    is to keep these fronds.

279
00:11:19,128 --> 00:11:24,899
  We'll hold those to the side.

280
00:11:24,901 --> 00:11:27,668
Fennel and cioppino -- you wanna
      talk about something

281
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:30,371
 going hand in hand, that's like
  Bogie and Bacall right there.

282
00:11:30,373 --> 00:11:31,539
          I don't know
  why I used Bogie and Bacall.

283
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:33,774
         I haven't used
    that line in a long time.

284
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,209
              Okay.
       So there's fennel.

285
00:11:35,211 --> 00:11:37,344
          There's that.
       Now check this out.

286
00:11:37,346 --> 00:11:41,515
 Get a little bit of olive oil,

287
00:11:41,517 --> 00:11:47,221
       little bit of salt,
   touch of some black pepper.

288
00:11:47,223 --> 00:11:48,789
 Believe it or not, we're gonna
  hit it with a little fennel.

289
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:52,092
    Fennel's a strong flavor
        in this cioppino.

290
00:11:52,094 --> 00:11:53,527
              Okay.
  We add a little fennel seeds.

291
00:11:53,529 --> 00:11:55,663
        And we'll hit it
 with a little red chili flake.

292
00:11:55,665 --> 00:11:58,699
          Again, spice
    is a key piece, as well.

293
00:11:58,701 --> 00:12:01,669
  And the last thing, and this
  is not what you're expecting

294
00:12:01,671 --> 00:12:03,571
         'cause you know
 garlic's gonna come into play,

295
00:12:03,573 --> 00:12:05,506
but not the way that we're gonna
      do garlic like this.

296
00:12:05,508 --> 00:12:07,875
 So we're gonna cut the top off.

297
00:12:07,877 --> 00:12:09,743
          Shout it out
     if you know the answer.

298
00:12:09,745 --> 00:12:12,880
            Exactly.
  We're gonna roast the garlic

299
00:12:12,882 --> 00:12:14,648
           like this.

300
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,383
 Great way -- Roasting garlic --
        I'm telling ya --

301
00:12:16,385 --> 00:12:17,851
    You've got the oven hot.
       You're gonna do it.

302
00:12:17,853 --> 00:12:19,453
       You know you'll use
         roasted garlic.

303
00:12:19,455 --> 00:12:26,694
 Get a little bit of olive oil,
    some salt, black pepper.

304
00:12:26,696 --> 00:12:29,163
  We're gonna kind of just nest
      this up a little bit.

305
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,031
    It'll steam as it roasts.

306
00:12:31,033 --> 00:12:33,934
 Give it a little breathing room
           like that.

307
00:12:33,936 --> 00:12:35,636
       Over to the grill.

308
00:12:35,638 --> 00:12:38,906
Now I'll lay that bad boy there.

309
00:12:38,908 --> 00:12:42,543
  Start to throw the fennel on,

310
00:12:42,545 --> 00:12:45,379
       throw the peppers,
     just keep an eye on it.

311
00:12:45,381 --> 00:12:46,647
      And, you know, here's
   the cool thing about this.

312
00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:48,282
   This is one of those things
       that you can grill.

313
00:12:48,284 --> 00:12:50,484
     You don't have to worry
     about how ugly it looks

314
00:12:50,486 --> 00:12:52,653
    because this is all gonna
         get pureed up.

315
00:12:52,655 --> 00:12:55,856
So if it has a little extra char
        to it, fantastic.

316
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,992
  That's a little extra flavor.

317
00:12:57,994 --> 00:13:00,728
          Look at that.

318
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:05,199
See if I can kinda slide 'em on.
               Ah.

319
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,834
 Tell me that doesn't look great
            already.

320
00:13:06,836 --> 00:13:07,901
 And to think this is all gonna

321
00:13:07,903 --> 00:13:10,004
          come together
       for a seafood dish.

322
00:13:10,006 --> 00:13:12,740
  That's my idea, right there.
              Okay.

323
00:13:12,742 --> 00:13:14,375
         So here we go.
      Saving those fronds.

324
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:15,376
      Roasting the veggies.

325
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:16,777
      The seafood is down.

326
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:18,612
     Last thing I'm gonna do
      is take this polenta,

327
00:13:18,614 --> 00:13:19,913
    bake it off in the oven.

328
00:13:19,915 --> 00:13:21,882
      We're gonna cut that.
   We're gonna grill it later.

329
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,150
          Come on back.

330
00:13:23,152 --> 00:13:24,918
    This is how we celebrate
the holidays at the Fieri house.

331
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,919
        See ya in a bit.

332
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,861
          Welcome back.
      I'm making cioppino.

333
00:13:33,863 --> 00:13:35,195
         Well, actually,
        grilled cioppino.

334
00:13:35,197 --> 00:13:36,297
     It's the holiday times

335
00:13:36,299 --> 00:13:38,632
     here at the Fieri casa,
        and look at this.

336
00:13:38,634 --> 00:13:42,102
       I've got everything
  from roasted grilled onions,

337
00:13:42,104 --> 00:13:44,171
     Roma tomatoes, fennel.

338
00:13:44,173 --> 00:13:45,706
              Whoo.
           Hot grill.

339
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:47,574
     Yeah, that's what we do
   in the holiday times here,

340
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:49,109
    is grill our vegetables.

341
00:13:49,111 --> 00:13:51,111
       But I'm gonna make
    this fantastic cioppino.

342
00:13:51,113 --> 00:13:53,981
   I've got a bunch of seafood
 that's in the fridge right now

343
00:13:53,983 --> 00:13:56,850
         just marinating
   in lemon juice, white wine,

344
00:13:56,852 --> 00:13:58,752
  garlic, capers, you name it.

345
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:02,089
   And this right here, well,
   this is the cioppino sauce.

346
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,657
  You don't typically see it as

347
00:14:03,659 --> 00:14:07,294
 a fire-roasted cioppino sauce,
  but I'll tell ya somethin' --

348
00:14:07,296 --> 00:14:10,331
   We're gonna highlight that
  seafood incredibly with this.

349
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:14,668
 A little bit of chicken stock,
          drop this on.

350
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,573
      Now I took the seeds

351
00:14:19,575 --> 00:14:22,109
          and the stems
     out of the bell pepper,

352
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,944
         but otherwise,
      everybody's in there.

353
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:28,182
      Look at all that char
       and all those bits.

354
00:14:28,184 --> 00:14:29,283
           All right.

355
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:30,951
         That's my kind
      of cioppino sauce --

356
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:33,487
     fire roasted, right on.

357
00:14:33,489 --> 00:14:35,222
          There we go.
    And if it gets too thick,

358
00:14:35,224 --> 00:14:37,057
  I got a little chicken stock
         to thin it out.

359
00:14:37,059 --> 00:14:41,995
     But right now, oh, you
should taste the fennel in that.

360
00:14:41,997 --> 00:14:43,497
           Righteous.
              Okay.

361
00:14:43,499 --> 00:14:46,266
   Let's take a look at that.
       Now, inside here --

362
00:14:46,268 --> 00:14:47,968
          inside here,
      take a look at this.

363
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,971
   Roasting off this polenta,
   and it's about ready to go.

364
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:54,842
    So I'm gonna pull it out,
 let it cool down a little bit,

365
00:14:54,844 --> 00:14:57,578
 and then we'll be able to grill
         that in a bit.

366
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,879
        All right, now --
       Oh, you know what?

367
00:14:58,881 --> 00:15:00,381
     I'm forgetting the key
      to this whole thing.

368
00:15:00,383 --> 00:15:01,482
         Check this out.

369
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:03,717
      Hiding under here...

370
00:15:03,719 --> 00:15:06,387
I started this garlic up on top,

371
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:08,989
 but it wasn't roasting enough.

372
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:13,394
   So down here in the coals,
   I've got my roasted garlic.

373
00:15:13,396 --> 00:15:15,295
  And we'll just -- Of course,

374
00:15:15,297 --> 00:15:17,164
     you got to have garlic
        in your cioppino.

375
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,432
         Check that out.

376
00:15:18,434 --> 00:15:21,068
    I'll just let that chill,
     cool down for a second.

377
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:24,838
     Let's grab the seafood.
              Okay.

378
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:28,809
 Scallops, halibut, big prawns,

379
00:15:28,811 --> 00:15:35,949
         and, of course,
 Dungeness crab all coming over.

380
00:15:35,951 --> 00:15:38,452
      Isn't that beautiful?

381
00:15:38,454 --> 00:15:39,753
          Look at that.

382
00:15:39,755 --> 00:15:41,655
     So we have the capers,
the lemon juice, the white wine,

383
00:15:41,657 --> 00:15:44,658
      a little chili flake,
  a bunch of garlic, of course.

384
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,827
   So let me lower this grate.

385
00:15:46,829 --> 00:15:49,897
                     ♪♪

386
00:15:53,235 --> 00:15:56,069
   Okay. A little fennel seeds
    were coming off of there.

387
00:15:56,071 --> 00:15:57,604
  Now, this is where this kind

388
00:15:57,606 --> 00:15:59,606
          of gets into
  some decision-making process.

389
00:15:59,608 --> 00:16:00,841
  What do I want to add first?

390
00:16:00,843 --> 00:16:02,509
   Well, I got the hard shell
          of the crab.

391
00:16:02,511 --> 00:16:03,944
   and it's pretty industrial.

392
00:16:03,946 --> 00:16:05,946
        I mean, it can --
  it can handle the heavy heat.

393
00:16:05,948 --> 00:16:09,550
          So I'm gonna
      throw that on first.

394
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:11,518
 Now I've got some really tender
            scallops.

395
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,120
   I don't wanna put those on
           right now.

396
00:16:13,122 --> 00:16:15,923
        That crab's gonna
   take a little bit of time.

397
00:16:15,925 --> 00:16:18,659
  The shrimp, they're protected
     also with their shell,

398
00:16:18,661 --> 00:16:21,995
   these prawns, so I'm gonna
  go ahead and throw those on.

399
00:16:21,997 --> 00:16:23,630
          The scallops
      are gonna be the ones

400
00:16:23,632 --> 00:16:25,232
   that I'm really gonna wait
    just till the last minute

401
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:27,000
     'cause all I want to do
  is just char it a little bit.

402
00:16:27,002 --> 00:16:28,502
  That sauce is gonna be warm,

403
00:16:28,504 --> 00:16:29,803
      so when the scallops
          go in there,

404
00:16:29,805 --> 00:16:33,373
          they'll just
   finish cooking right there.

405
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,509
          Look at that.
 You should smell it right now.

406
00:16:35,511 --> 00:16:38,946
   I mean, it smells like a --
almost kind of like a crab boil,

407
00:16:38,948 --> 00:16:40,147
   or like when you're cooking
             some --

408
00:16:40,149 --> 00:16:41,882
   some oysters on the grill.

409
00:16:41,884 --> 00:16:43,584
          Look at that.

410
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:45,385
              Okay.

411
00:16:45,387 --> 00:16:48,188
         And here we go.
   I'm gonna put the fish on.

412
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:53,060
    It'll probably go on last
       and come off first.

413
00:16:53,062 --> 00:16:55,529
        Nestle that right
       in on top of there.

414
00:16:55,531 --> 00:16:57,998
  And then I'm just gonna hold
those scallops for a little bit.

415
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,100
         I'll put those
     on at the last minute.

416
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,568
              Okay.

417
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:03,837
     Slide that to the side.

418
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,472
               Oh.

419
00:17:05,474 --> 00:17:06,874
  The flavors, I'm telling you.

420
00:17:06,876 --> 00:17:09,009
    Now, I took that garlic,
            roasted,

421
00:17:09,011 --> 00:17:10,277
a little bit of salt and pepper.

422
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:13,146
      And this, well, this
  can get a little bit sticky.

423
00:17:13,148 --> 00:17:14,448
            Trust me,
   I've done this enough times

424
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:18,318
from the days in the restaurant.

425
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,419
           All right.

426
00:17:19,421 --> 00:17:21,421
            Awesome.
     Roasted garlic's down.

427
00:17:21,423 --> 00:17:22,956
     Seafood's on the grill.

428
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:26,260
 We are doing grilled cioppino.
  People are flying in for it.

429
00:17:26,262 --> 00:17:27,561
     It's gonna be a blast!
        See ya in a bit.

430
00:17:30,032 --> 00:17:31,865
  Welcome back. Man, it is hot
       in here right now.

431
00:17:31,867 --> 00:17:33,000
       You wouldn't think,
        in the holidays,

432
00:17:33,002 --> 00:17:34,334
    it's gonna be this warm.

433
00:17:34,336 --> 00:17:36,870
    But what we've got goin'
      is grilled cioppino.

434
00:17:36,872 --> 00:17:38,972
       I'm keeping an eye
    on my scallops right now.

435
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:42,276
 So I'm just trying to finish up
 this fantastic cioppino sauce.

436
00:17:42,278 --> 00:17:44,778
        Grilled tomatoes
       and red bell pepper

437
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:47,281
   and a little bit of fennel.
      Some roasted garlic.

438
00:17:47,283 --> 00:17:48,482
   I'll get that later 'cause

439
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,317
          I don't want
    the scallops to overcook.

440
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,786
Add a little ouzo there because,
 if you've got a good cioppino,

441
00:17:52,788 --> 00:17:54,988
  you know it's got some spice,
      it's got some garlic,

442
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,090
       and it's got a nice
      little anise flavor,

443
00:17:57,092 --> 00:17:59,960
            and...Ah.

444
00:17:59,962 --> 00:18:02,629
        That is right on.
              Okay.

445
00:18:02,631 --> 00:18:04,231
        We'll take this.

446
00:18:04,233 --> 00:18:08,902
       Gonna pour it right
      onto my platter here.

447
00:18:08,904 --> 00:18:11,905
    And I've got some grilled
     polenta sitting there.

448
00:18:11,907 --> 00:18:14,942
  Add a little roasted peppers
  to it, add a little Pecorino

449
00:18:14,944 --> 00:18:17,210
   cheese to it, let it cool,

450
00:18:17,212 --> 00:18:19,212
 put it on a sheet tray, popped
 it in the oven, put a little --

451
00:18:19,214 --> 00:18:20,514
    browned it a little bit,

452
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,115
 then took it, cut it in some --

453
00:18:22,117 --> 00:18:23,951
 in some squares and grilled it.

454
00:18:23,953 --> 00:18:25,619
   Now some beautiful halibut

455
00:18:25,621 --> 00:18:28,355
      that's all marinated,
           by the way.

456
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,690
     leave that right there.

457
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:32,326
  All marinated in some capers,
      a little chili flake,

458
00:18:32,328 --> 00:18:33,894
 some garlic, some white white,

459
00:18:33,896 --> 00:18:37,130
     a bunch of lemon juice,
        salt and pepper.

460
00:18:37,132 --> 00:18:41,068
 Take these beautiful scallops,
   lay those around the side.

461
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:43,637
  And I just want these super,
          super tender

462
00:18:43,639 --> 00:18:46,440
      'cause they're gonna
   sit inside that hot sauce.

463
00:18:46,442 --> 00:18:49,376
                     ♪♪

464
00:18:57,987 --> 00:18:59,620
      I mean, look at that.

465
00:18:59,622 --> 00:19:01,955
  Tell me that is not gorgeous.

466
00:19:01,957 --> 00:19:04,524
        Right like that.
        Oh, don't worry.

467
00:19:04,526 --> 00:19:06,493
   Nothing will happen to that
    except for me eating it,

468
00:19:06,495 --> 00:19:09,096
         but, you know,
   I don't tell anybody that.

469
00:19:09,098 --> 00:19:10,464
          Look at that.

470
00:19:10,466 --> 00:19:13,734
 Get a little bit of the sauce.

471
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:18,739
     Just drop a little bit
         on top of this.

472
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:20,674
     I mean, it's gorgeous.

473
00:19:20,676 --> 00:19:22,843
    Little more of the basil,

474
00:19:22,845 --> 00:19:27,748
 some of the fennel fronds that
  I had, lay that over on top.

475
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:31,118
    So you grab a nice piece
    of that grilled polenta.

476
00:19:35,124 --> 00:19:37,057
         It's a busy day
      at the airport here.

477
00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:40,260
     Some fresh lemon juice
   right over the top of that.

478
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:43,063
              Huh?

479
00:19:43,065 --> 00:19:48,068
  Tell me that is not a platter
      set for the holidays.

480
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:49,836
   Is that beautiful or what?

481
00:19:49,838 --> 00:19:52,305
        I'm telling you,
     that is just gorgeous,

482
00:19:52,307 --> 00:19:53,940
           especially
   with that grilled polenta.

483
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:57,978
   That's what makes it, that
  and a nice little white wine.

484
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:01,615
 Okay. First, I got to dig into
          some polenta,

485
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:04,251
  a little bit of this halibut.

486
00:20:04,253 --> 00:20:09,289
          Mm. And then,
 when you wanna get your crab --

487
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:12,059
      I'm a body meat guy.

488
00:20:12,061 --> 00:20:16,463
  So you dip it right in there,
      this Dungeness crab.

489
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:17,964
  Of all the crab that I have,

490
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:21,868
         I mean, from --
  from king crab, snow crab --

491
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:23,503
  You can tell I don't like it.

492
00:20:23,505 --> 00:20:25,005
    This is the one to go to.

493
00:20:25,007 --> 00:20:26,506
   Now, listen, you might not
   be able to find Dungeness.

494
00:20:26,508 --> 00:20:28,175
          Don't worry.
  You find your favorite crab.

495
00:20:28,177 --> 00:20:29,943
      But here's the idea.

496
00:20:29,945 --> 00:20:31,144
  I don't care if it's snowing.

497
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:33,213
     Get out on that porch,
     fire up that barbecue,

498
00:20:33,215 --> 00:20:34,448
     grill off the seafood,

499
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:37,417
      keep it in the shell,
     put a nice char to it.

500
00:20:37,419 --> 00:20:38,752
  We all love that char flavor.

501
00:20:38,754 --> 00:20:40,220
   It takes us back to summer.

502
00:20:40,222 --> 00:20:41,621
         So have summer
      during the holidays.

503
00:20:41,623 --> 00:20:43,156
   You wanna get this recipe?
      You know what to do.

505

       is waiting for you.

506
00:20:48,697 --> 00:20:50,897

      Take care, you guys.

507
00:20:50,899 --> 00:20:51,932

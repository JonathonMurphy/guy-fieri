1
00:00:01,702 --> 00:00:03,002
Hey, there. I'm Guy Fieri,
  and we're rolling out

2
00:00:03,004 --> 00:00:04,737
looking for America's
  greatest diners,

3
00:00:04,739 --> 00:00:06,538
drive-ins,
   and dives.

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,540
This trip...
Drop the clutch.

5
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:11,210
...we're taking an eclectic road
   to Flavortown.

6
00:00:11,212 --> 00:00:13,112
I just want
    to eat it all.

7
00:00:13,114 --> 00:00:15,414
With some twists
 and turns along the way.

8
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:16,749
I'm doing exactly
    what you're doing.

9
00:00:16,751 --> 00:00:17,783
You gotta
    be kidding me.

10
00:00:17,785 --> 00:00:19,485
Like a decades-old
   family joint...

11
00:00:19,487 --> 00:00:21,053
Mm!
 You'll love this.

12
00:00:21,055 --> 00:00:24,289
...cooking classic Creole
 right in the heart of L.A.

13
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:26,325
It's like a little hidden
gem in the neighborhood.
       Yeah.

14
00:00:26,327 --> 00:00:27,726
And a Minneapolis butcher...

15
00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:31,163
The turkey was dynamite,
but the pastrami is legit.

16
00:00:31,165 --> 00:00:33,866
...cranking out cold
  cuts minus the meat.

17
00:00:33,868 --> 00:00:35,701
I'm impressed.
 I'm trippin'.

18
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:37,803
And in Maui...
    Getting after it,
     aren't ya?

19
00:00:37,805 --> 00:00:40,072
...a funky noodle joint...
     Delicious.

20
00:00:40,074 --> 00:00:41,440
Really,
    really delicious.

21
00:00:41,442 --> 00:00:44,410
...serving up something
 that just rocked my world.

22
00:00:44,412 --> 00:00:46,845
Whoa!
    New favorite!

23
00:00:46,847 --> 00:00:49,081
That's all right here,
   right now,

24
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:52,017
on "Diners, Drive-ins & Dives."

25
00:01:05,433 --> 00:01:06,665
You know how I
  always say slow down

26
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:08,233
and take a look around?

27
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:09,668
Well, that might not apply
   for this next

28
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:10,969
"Triple D" location.

29
00:01:10,971 --> 00:01:13,338
Well, unless you're in Maui

30
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,340
And you happen to be
 driving through some random

31
00:01:15,342 --> 00:01:16,675
industrial park,

32
00:01:16,677 --> 00:01:18,177
and you're looking
  for a fantastic place

33
00:01:18,179 --> 00:01:20,045
that scratch makes
  all their noodles.

34
00:01:20,047 --> 00:01:22,848
Well, then you're in luck
 because this is Star Noodle.

35
00:01:26,187 --> 00:01:28,454
How's that
 frijole?
    It's just got it,
     you know.

36
00:01:28,456 --> 00:01:29,888
It's just amazing.

37
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,890
Picking up
   kimchi wings.
       I love
      this place.

38
00:01:31,892 --> 00:01:33,525
One of the best
  restaurants in the island.

39
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:36,095
Hey, guys. Bacon and eggs
   here for you.

40
00:01:36,097 --> 00:01:38,197
When we arrive,
  it's kind of unpack

41
00:01:38,199 --> 00:01:39,998
and rush to Star Noodle.

42
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,567
But it's not just
   for tourists.

43
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:44,002
When Michael Moore
   opened in 2010,

44
00:01:44,004 --> 00:01:46,171
he knew how to draw
  in the locals, as well.

45
00:01:46,173 --> 00:01:49,575
We wanted food that local people
   especially knew about,

46
00:01:49,577 --> 00:01:51,844
but we try to amp it up
    a little bit.

47
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,379
I need tempura.

48
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:56,982
Asian-inspired,
Island, Pacific Rim.

49
00:01:56,984 --> 00:01:59,351
You have the
    "Hapa Ramen" here.

50
00:01:59,353 --> 00:02:01,620
The ramen
 is wonderful.

51
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:03,956
The pork inside
   is tender.

52
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:05,557
And they make
    their own noodles.

53
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:08,060
Chef Ivan Pahk preps
  the scratch-made dough,

54
00:02:08,062 --> 00:02:11,897
and Lorilei Aloha Aguiar fires
  up the 80-year-old

55
00:02:11,899 --> 00:02:14,099
Japanese noodle machine.

56
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:15,801
Oh, I want one.

57
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:16,768
All right,
 let's get into it.

58
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,470
Over here,
    we just have water.

59
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,472
Egg whites,
    salt, sugar,

60
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:22,007
and potassium
     carbonate.

61
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:25,210
That's gonna give it the chew,
    that stretchy part.

62
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:27,713
All right, Lori, he got me
through the real difficult part

63
00:02:27,715 --> 00:02:29,281
of mixing
everything together.

64
00:02:29,283 --> 00:02:30,349
Oh, totally.
  But now
  he says

65
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:31,817
that the pro
 has to come in.

66
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:33,552
So you take the flour
   and the wheat gluten,

67
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:36,488
put it in the hopper,
     turn it on.

68
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,157
Drop the clutch.
    Pour the liquid.

69
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:40,325
Okay, so everything's in there.
How long is that gonna mix?

70
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:43,028
Three minutes. Then we put
 the crumbles in the sheeter.

71
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,663
We got the gauges
     all good.

72
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:46,598
Organize
 the flux capacitor.

73
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,067
And then we roll it
  through to make a sheet,

74
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:50,903
and we put it back up
    on the roll.

75
00:02:50,905 --> 00:02:52,638
And then we're gonna go
into the cutting process.

76
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,174
Mm-hmm.
That's beautiful.

77
00:02:55,176 --> 00:02:57,943
Let's go cook those, Chef.
  You ready?
    Yep.

78
00:02:57,945 --> 00:02:59,778
So we're gonna brine the pork
  for the Hapa Ramen.

79
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:04,416
Water. Garlic. Maui onion, salt,
  green onion palms.

80
00:03:04,418 --> 00:03:07,319
Peppercorns,
 brown sugar, honey,

81
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:10,489
bay leaf, ginger,
 and lemongrass.

82
00:03:10,491 --> 00:03:12,157
Oh.
  Bring this
  to a boil.

83
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,759
Okay
 And then we'll
pour it right in here.

84
00:03:13,761 --> 00:03:15,194
Shock it.

85
00:03:15,196 --> 00:03:17,129
After we shock it,
then we squeeze the lemon,

86
00:03:17,131 --> 00:03:19,898
and we pour
 it right in.

87
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,733
And this is gonna marinate
    for 24 hours?

88
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:23,335
24 hours.
     Then we
    roast it off.

89
00:03:23,337 --> 00:03:24,803
375 for 1 hour.

90
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:26,471
Then we cover it,
then 300 for another 2 hours.

91
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:28,207
And then low and slow.
     Got it.

92
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:30,642
Okay, Chef.
   Roasted cold pork butt.

93
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:32,344
Break it apart,
we cut it into chunks.

94
00:03:32,346 --> 00:03:33,779
And we want a lot
    of that fat.

95
00:03:33,781 --> 00:03:35,480
That's part
    of the deal.

96
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:37,115
Enriches the dish.

97
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:38,483
So then we resteam it.

98
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:40,919
Okay. Next up, that's
   the ramen that we made.

99
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:44,590
Yeah.
    Now we take some
   of the steamed pork.

100
00:03:44,592 --> 00:03:46,258
In the broth, oh.

101
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,393
And then we get
    some kamaboko.

102
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,629
And what is kamaboko?
  Fish cake?
      Fish cake.

103
00:03:50,631 --> 00:03:51,763
Bamboo shoots
    that we stewed down

104
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:53,232
in soy sauce
     and dashi.

105
00:03:53,234 --> 00:03:54,600
Okay.
     A bunch
    of green onion.

106
00:03:54,602 --> 00:03:56,401
Some blanched
  bok choy.

107
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,904
And then your favorite.
    A soft-boiled egg.

108
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:01,006
Yeah, you're
real funny, Chef.

109
00:04:01,008 --> 00:04:02,441
And then we put
 the pork stock.

110
00:04:02,443 --> 00:04:04,643
So the pork stock is
an emulsification of fat.

111
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:06,111
We got pork bones,
a bunch of vegetables,

112
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:07,679
some apples,
 Chinese cabbage.

113
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:09,915
You pour it -- Oh!

114
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:11,984
Two more things
   we gotta put on there.

115
00:04:11,986 --> 00:04:14,519
The aka miso, which is miso,
    some soybean,

116
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:15,921
some sugar,
    we cook it down.

117
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:19,558
And then we have mayu, which
  is garlic and sesame paste.

118
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,227
That's our signature
 bowl of noodles.

119
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,535
It's a funky little joint
    next to a boatyard,

120
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:32,137
and you're making
    this kind of food.

121
00:04:33,374 --> 00:04:35,874
Delicious.
  Really, really delicious.

122
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:38,577
I love the noodles.
    Fantastic texture.

123
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:40,746
I love all the goodies
  that you put along there,

124
00:04:40,748 --> 00:04:44,583
the bamboo shoots, the bok choy.
    The pork is great.

125
00:04:44,585 --> 00:04:46,485
It's tender,
    a little fatty,

126
00:04:46,487 --> 00:04:47,919
lots of flavor
     in it.

127
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:51,723
But that broth, homey --
     outrageous.

128
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:52,958
Pick up Hapa.

129
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,728
So many different explosions
of flavor mixed together.

130
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:59,898
I just want to eat it all,
    but I can't.

131
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,333
I'll be asleep.

132
00:05:01,335 --> 00:05:02,634
There's more show
     to do.

133
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:04,436
And more menu to dig into.

134
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:05,904
Vietnamese crepe.

135
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:06,972
Pork
with shrimp mixture.

136
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:10,242
Super-good herbs,
a really nice crunch.

137
00:05:10,244 --> 00:05:11,109
Crepes in an Asian
   noodle joint?

138
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:13,245
Now, that's something
   I gotta try,
 Super-good herbs,
a really nice crunch.

139
00:05:13,247 --> 00:05:14,913
when we come back.

140
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:23,221
Welcome back.
   We're hanging out here

141
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:24,823
on the west side
     of Maui

142
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:26,458
at a funky joint
    called Star Noodle.

143
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,994
Now, I can guarantee, you would
  never drive by the place

144
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:30,762
'cause it's kind of
   on the dead-end side

145
00:05:30,764 --> 00:05:32,831
of an industrial park.
Mm-hmm.

146
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,733
So you will need to
 get directions, but trust me.

147
00:05:34,735 --> 00:05:36,601
It is so worth it.

148
00:05:36,603 --> 00:05:39,638
Lots of different flavors
 to try every time you come in.

149
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,273
We have our Vietnamese
     crepe here.

150
00:05:41,275 --> 00:05:44,343
The Vietnamese crepe
probably are our favorite.

151
00:05:44,345 --> 00:05:46,812
The inside
  is pork and shrimp,

152
00:05:46,814 --> 00:05:48,980
and the outside
  is a crunchy shell.

153
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:52,184
He makes a lettuce wrap
out of it with lovely herbs.

154
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:56,271
It's delicious.

155
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:57,172
Turmeric.
     Turmeric.

156
00:05:57,174 --> 00:05:58,507
Really nice
    color in this.

157
00:05:58,509 --> 00:06:01,109
Your favorite.
     Yes, please,
      more.

158
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:02,611
And then we got
 some limestone.

159
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:03,512
Limestone?
 Limestone.

160
00:06:03,514 --> 00:06:04,646
It makes
 it super crispy.

161
00:06:04,648 --> 00:06:06,148
Then we're gonna
 immersion-blend it.

162
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:09,151
So we got a hot pan.

163
00:06:09,153 --> 00:06:11,253
So, while that's cooking,
we're gonna do the filling.

164
00:06:11,255 --> 00:06:12,687
So we get
 some loco pork.

165
00:06:12,689 --> 00:06:14,556
Some loco pork?
 Mm-hmm.

166
00:06:14,558 --> 00:06:16,024
Crazy pig.
 Crazy pig.

167
00:06:16,026 --> 00:06:18,527
So let's do
 a shallow fry.

168
00:06:18,529 --> 00:06:20,796
What are you putting in there,
  before it burns both of us?

169
00:06:20,798 --> 00:06:22,431
The shallow fry.
     Shallow fry,

170
00:06:22,433 --> 00:06:23,999
thanks a lot
  for letting me know, homey.

171
00:06:24,001 --> 00:06:26,034
See,
    folks at home,

172
00:06:26,036 --> 00:06:28,070
when you have water
     in the pan,

173
00:06:28,072 --> 00:06:29,638
which that batter
    has a ton of it,

174
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,973
and then you add
  some more hot oil to it,

175
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:34,009
they don't
    like each other.

176
00:06:34,011 --> 00:06:35,544
Is that gonna get crunchy
    like a wonton?

177
00:06:35,546 --> 00:06:37,979
Yeah.
     That crepe
   just dancing in there.

178
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:39,848
Okay, so frying
 off the pork.

179
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:41,750
Add a little bit of salt,
 white pepper,

180
00:06:41,752 --> 00:06:44,920
a little garlic,
some fish sauce, coconut milk.

181
00:06:44,922 --> 00:06:46,955
Shrimp.
    You're getting
   after it, aren't you?

182
00:06:46,957 --> 00:06:48,657
Okay, now, we're gonna add
the fresh bean sprouts.

183
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:50,692
Okay.
 And some fresh
 green onion.

184
00:06:50,694 --> 00:06:52,527
Now we're ready to flip.
    Look at that.

185
00:06:52,529 --> 00:06:53,795
I've seen a lot.

186
00:06:53,797 --> 00:06:55,163
This is a new one
     for me.

187
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:56,531
So then
 we take it out.

188
00:06:56,533 --> 00:06:57,833
And it goes
   with the salad here.

189
00:06:57,835 --> 00:07:00,068
Yeah.
 The filling.
     I don't know.

190
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,470
I'm doing exactly
    what you're doing.

191
00:07:01,472 --> 00:07:04,106
You gotta be kidding me.
  How is he gonna eat that?

192
00:07:04,108 --> 00:07:05,507
So it's almost like
 a lettuce wrap.

193
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:10,011
We cut it, grab a lettuce,
some of the filling.

194
00:07:10,881 --> 00:07:14,516
Couple of the crunchies, herbs,
and we put the sauce.

195
00:07:14,518 --> 00:07:16,751
I think we're gonna draw the
 line at you feeding me, okay?

196
00:07:16,753 --> 00:07:17,986
Okay. Okay.

197
00:07:22,793 --> 00:07:25,727
Oh! New favorite.

198
00:07:25,729 --> 00:07:28,063
The word crepe
  completely throws it off.

199
00:07:28,065 --> 00:07:29,631
It's crunchy.

200
00:07:29,633 --> 00:07:31,600
The shrimp, the bean sprout.
 Love the bean sprout in there.

201
00:07:31,602 --> 00:07:32,934
Having the Thai
    basil available

202
00:07:32,936 --> 00:07:35,670
and the cilantro,
     the crepe.

203
00:07:35,672 --> 00:07:38,240
I want to have
    crepe chips.

204
00:07:38,242 --> 00:07:40,041
Mm. Mm, mm!

205
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:42,077
It's so good that,

206
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,778
if this was the only thing
    you got to come

207
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:46,014
and have to eat
 in your whole visit to Hawaii,

208
00:07:46,016 --> 00:07:47,382
it'd be worth it.

209
00:07:49,253 --> 00:07:50,986
Mm! God,
    that's good!

210
00:07:50,988 --> 00:07:53,655
Crepe going
in the window, Chef. Herb.

211
00:07:53,657 --> 00:07:55,190
It's an amazing dish.
  It's my favorite.

212
00:07:55,192 --> 00:07:58,493
This might be in the top
25 most unique items

213
00:07:58,495 --> 00:07:59,995
I've ever seen
 on "Triple D."

214
00:07:59,997 --> 00:08:01,396
Pick it up
    "Look Moore Fun"

215
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:02,597
Love this place.

216
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:04,733
Do lunch and dinner here,
it's really that good.

217
00:08:04,735 --> 00:08:06,701
You have lunch, go to the beach,
you come back for dinner.

218
00:08:06,703 --> 00:08:07,869
It's the best.

219
00:08:07,871 --> 00:08:10,772
The first time
 you have this, I promise you,

220
00:08:10,774 --> 00:08:12,073
you will
    not forget it.

221
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:14,476
You're the bomb.
     Nice job.
Thank you, Chef.

222
00:08:15,679 --> 00:08:17,946
Coming up, a real-deal
  taste of New Orleans...

223
00:08:17,948 --> 00:08:19,347
Oh, I'll just sit here
 and eat it all day.

224
00:08:19,349 --> 00:08:21,750
...cooked up in Los Angeles
  for generations.

225
00:08:21,752 --> 00:08:23,985
This is
old school right here.

226
00:08:31,128 --> 00:08:33,428
You know, on "Triple D,"
 we have featured just about

227
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,697
every type of food
  you can imagine.

228
00:08:35,699 --> 00:08:39,034
But one that we don't do
nearly enough, Creole and Cajun.

229
00:08:39,036 --> 00:08:41,536
So, guess where I'm at?
 I'm in Los Angeles, California,

230
00:08:41,538 --> 00:08:43,572
in the Jefferson Park
 neighborhood to check out

231
00:08:43,574 --> 00:08:45,207
a joint that I've been to before

232
00:08:45,209 --> 00:08:46,575
and you're gonna love.

233
00:08:46,577 --> 00:08:49,277
This is Harold & Belle's.

234
00:08:51,982 --> 00:08:53,281
One jambalaya.

235
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:56,351
Just totally unlike anything
  else you'll find in L.A.

236
00:08:56,353 --> 00:08:58,420
I have catfish nuggets
  for the gentleman.

237
00:08:58,422 --> 00:09:01,223
You want a touch
  or a taste of New Orleans,

238
00:09:01,225 --> 00:09:02,857
Harold & Belle's is
    the place to come.

239
00:09:02,859 --> 00:09:06,027
This restaurant has been
 in the same family

240
00:09:06,029 --> 00:09:07,796
for 47 years.

241
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:11,199
Going back to 1969,
 when Louisiana transplants

242
00:09:11,201 --> 00:09:13,368
Harold and
 Mary Belle Legaux opened

243
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:16,538
a dive bar
 serving up gumbo and po'boys.

244
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,940
Now five decades
 and two renovations later,

245
00:09:18,942 --> 00:09:21,710
grandson Ryan's still
  cooking up the Creole.

246
00:09:21,712 --> 00:09:23,445
All four of my grandparents
   are from New Orleans.

247
00:09:23,447 --> 00:09:25,847
I have a very Creole
    last name, Legaux.

248
00:09:25,849 --> 00:09:27,048
L-e-g-a-u-x.

249
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:28,450
The only people
that have "X" in their name

250
00:09:28,452 --> 00:09:30,018
are people
that come from Louisiana.
       Right.

251
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,687
I don't find much Cajun Creole
food in the West Coast,

252
00:09:32,689 --> 00:09:34,422
so when I came here
 and I met this guy

253
00:09:34,424 --> 00:09:36,625
and I tried the food, I'm like,
you're the real deal, brother.

254
00:09:36,627 --> 00:09:38,994
Large gumbo.
  The gumbo's
one of my favorite dishes.

255
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:42,497
Sausage, chicken, crab.

256
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:44,799
When I think
of making true gumbo,

257
00:09:44,801 --> 00:09:46,167
I'm thinking
 of all the goods.

258
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:48,770
All right, buddy,
 fire it up.
     Seafood stock.

259
00:09:48,772 --> 00:09:51,339
Okay.
    What we're gonna do
  next is put in our trinity.

260
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,475
In the French cooking,
 you have mirepoix,

261
00:09:53,477 --> 00:09:55,543
which is the onions
and celery and the carrots,

262
00:09:55,545 --> 00:09:56,978
and in Creole cooking,

263
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:59,047
you have the peppers,
the celery, and the onions.

264
00:09:59,049 --> 00:10:00,982
Have you ever heard
the term filet gumbo?

265
00:10:00,984 --> 00:10:02,917
This is the ground-up
 sassafras leaf.

266
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:04,519
Creole seasoning.

267
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,254
Ground thyme,
    ground basil,

268
00:10:06,256 --> 00:10:08,523
dried parsley flakes.
    More black pepper.

269
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:10,225
We had some in our Creole
    seasoning already.

270
00:10:10,227 --> 00:10:12,260
We like more.
   More granulated onion,

271
00:10:12,262 --> 00:10:13,828
more granulated garlic.

272
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:16,431
Okay.
     I'm gonna
    let that cook down,

273
00:10:16,433 --> 00:10:18,133
and then we're gonna
 add our roux. Thicken it up.

274
00:10:18,135 --> 00:10:20,168
all that in there?
      Most of it.

275
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:22,304
The roux's the key, baby.
  Next up.

276
00:10:22,306 --> 00:10:24,706
Some boneless/skinless
chicken thighs, seasoned with...

277
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,875
Harold and Belle's
 Creole seasoning.

278
00:10:26,877 --> 00:10:29,911
Beef hot links.
    Diced pit ham.

279
00:10:29,913 --> 00:10:32,347
Smoked sausage.
Really key.

280
00:10:32,349 --> 00:10:33,548
You know, a lot of recipes
    in New Orleans,

281
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,283
they use andouille,
 which is like a combination.

282
00:10:35,285 --> 00:10:36,551
Right.
    Spicy and smoke,

283
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:38,320
so we just do it
 with two different sausages.

284
00:10:38,322 --> 00:10:41,856
Blue crab. This is another key
    for the flavor.

285
00:10:41,858 --> 00:10:44,492
In the last 15 minutes beforeook
service, we'll drop the shrimp?

286
00:10:44,494 --> 00:10:46,961
We'll drop
   the shrimp in there.
 Okay.

287
00:10:46,963 --> 00:10:48,430
Oh,
 it looks fantastic.

288
00:10:48,432 --> 00:10:50,565
All right, Guy.
  You ready for some gumbo?
Do it.

289
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:53,468
Make sure we get you some blue
 crab and some shrimp on there.

290
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:55,870
A little parsley.
 Look at
 this gumbo.

291
00:10:55,872 --> 00:10:57,339
It's not thin
  like stock.

292
00:10:57,341 --> 00:10:59,808
It's not heavy
  like stew.

293
00:11:01,945 --> 00:11:03,778
Mm.
 That's fantastic.

294
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,313
You pick up that seafood.
Even though there was

295
00:11:05,315 --> 00:11:07,215
just a little bit
 of that blue crab,

296
00:11:07,217 --> 00:11:09,851
you get --
   Mm!

297
00:11:09,853 --> 00:11:11,553
Velvety texture
coming over your tongue

298
00:11:11,555 --> 00:11:14,189
from that sassafras,
getting it from that roux.
     Right.

299
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:18,293
Oh, I'll just sit here
 and eat it all day.

300
00:11:18,295 --> 00:11:20,795
A small filet gumbo.
The gumbo
     is amazing.

301
00:11:20,797 --> 00:11:22,897
The spices,
     the flavor.

302
00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:24,599
This
    is Tara and Cara.

303
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:26,134
Tara's
   on the culinary team

304
00:11:26,136 --> 00:11:27,702
for
   "Guy's Grocery Games."

305
00:11:27,704 --> 00:11:29,137
And this is Cara,
    who's actually

306
00:11:29,139 --> 00:11:31,139
one of our editors
  and helps develop the show.

307
00:11:31,141 --> 00:11:33,708
So, since you both
   have such wide-range

308
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:35,977
knowledge of the food,
    take it away.

309
00:11:37,681 --> 00:11:40,315
So, the gumbo here
 has two types of sausage.

310
00:11:40,317 --> 00:11:42,050
And one's
  light and fluffy,

311
00:11:42,052 --> 00:11:43,618
and the other's
  got, like, a nice bite.

312
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,954
I love both.
 Having a little bit
  of soul

313
00:11:45,956 --> 00:11:48,423
and a little bit of spice
in the heart of L.A.

314
00:11:48,425 --> 00:11:49,791
is a nice balance.

315
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:52,494
Jefferson Park area
  was a stopping-off point

316
00:11:52,496 --> 00:11:55,063
for a lot of people
 that had moved from Louisiana,

317
00:11:55,065 --> 00:11:57,465
and Harold & Belle's was
    kind of an anchor

318
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:58,733
for people
    to come together.

319
00:11:58,735 --> 00:12:00,135
It's like a little hidden gem
in the neighborhood.

320
00:12:00,137 --> 00:12:01,536
Yeah, I wouldn't even
    know it was here.

321
00:12:01,538 --> 00:12:03,338
Good buddy of mine, Walt,
one of our camera guys

322
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,939
on "Guy's Grocery Games."

323
00:12:04,941 --> 00:12:07,008
Tell me what you think
 of the food.
    It's incredible.

324
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:08,610
Crawfish étouffée ready.

325
00:12:08,612 --> 00:12:12,313
Shrimp and crawfish smothered
in this beautiful gravy sauce.

326
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:13,748
Okay, now we're
 into the étouffée.

327
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,316
Right,
   we start with the roux.

328
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:16,918
Canola and olive oil.

329
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,421
Once the oil's hot,
 we're gonna stir in our flour.

330
00:12:19,423 --> 00:12:21,322
We want this roux to kind
   of be a brownish color,

331
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:22,690
kind of like the color
    of peanut butter.

332
00:12:22,692 --> 00:12:24,125
When the roux is
    at the temperature

333
00:12:24,127 --> 00:12:25,794
we want it at,
 we're gonna add our trinity.

334
00:12:25,796 --> 00:12:28,463
Our red and green bell peppers,
our onions, and our celery.

335
00:12:28,465 --> 00:12:31,166
Correct. Harold & Belle's
    Creole seasoning,

336
00:12:31,168 --> 00:12:33,435
ground bay leaf,
    minced garlic,

337
00:12:33,437 --> 00:12:35,837
hot sauce,
    granulated garlic,

338
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,139
and more paprika,
 cayenne pepper, not too much.

339
00:12:38,141 --> 00:12:39,674
We have
   some ground basil...

340
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:42,377
Okay.
   ...some parsley flakes,
    some black pepper.

341
00:12:42,379 --> 00:12:44,145
Worcestershire?
     Yes, sir.

342
00:12:44,147 --> 00:12:46,214
A little bit of
   extra Creole seasoning.

343
00:12:46,216 --> 00:12:47,449
We're gonna
    stir it all in.

344
00:12:47,451 --> 00:12:49,083
The roux's starting
 to tighten up.

345
00:12:49,085 --> 00:12:50,552
We're gonna add
    some tomato soup.

346
00:12:50,554 --> 00:12:51,986
I don't know that
I've seen tomato soup,

347
00:12:51,988 --> 00:12:53,388
but I'll give it
  to you.
     Shrimp stock.

348
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:55,590
Okay.
    Let this simmer
    for about an hour.

349
00:12:55,592 --> 00:12:57,625
And then...
     We're gonna
    add our crawfish.

350
00:12:57,627 --> 00:12:59,060
Ah, that's gonna work
  for me.

351
00:12:59,062 --> 00:13:00,995
Let that cook down, get
 the crawfish flavor in there.

352
00:13:00,997 --> 00:13:02,464
About a half-hour
  is all you need for that.

353
00:13:02,466 --> 00:13:04,032
Then we're gonna add
  the cream of mushroom soup.

354
00:13:04,034 --> 00:13:06,201
And that's how it was
 made 40 years ago?

355
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:07,335
This is old school
  right here.

356
00:13:07,337 --> 00:13:09,504
We cool it down and then
   heat it up to order.

357
00:13:09,506 --> 00:13:11,372
'Cause if you held it hot,
it would just sit there

358
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:12,841
and continue
 to cook down.

359
00:13:12,843 --> 00:13:15,877
Extra crawfish tails.
 Our étouffée is nice and hot.

360
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:17,712
Gonna put it in a bowl
    for you, Guy.

361
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:20,014
We'll just put
  a little parsley on there.

362
00:13:20,016 --> 00:13:21,916
Tight
 but not too tight.

363
00:13:21,918 --> 00:13:25,553
Mm. My buddy Kim Gardner --
and this dude's Cajun.

364
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:27,155
Kim, what's up, buddy?

365
00:13:27,157 --> 00:13:30,825
Uh, and this is the first time
I had real étouffée.

366
00:13:30,827 --> 00:13:33,294
And there's so much flavor
 going on in this.

367
00:13:33,296 --> 00:13:35,797
All the spices, I mean,
you are just talking deep

368
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:38,266
and rich and creamy.

369
00:13:38,268 --> 00:13:40,835
And you get nice, little,
tender crawfish inside of it.

370
00:13:40,837 --> 00:13:43,104
Crawfish is an intensified
 shrimp flavor

371
00:13:43,106 --> 00:13:45,740
and a great, meaty texture,
kind of like lobster.

372
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:48,343
Mmm!
 You'll love this.

373
00:13:48,345 --> 00:13:50,078
Shrimp and crawfish
   étouffée.

374
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,880
Really, really
   incredible crawfish.

375
00:13:51,882 --> 00:13:54,516
It's spicy,
 but not<i> too</i> spicy.

376
00:13:54,518 --> 00:13:56,117
It always delivers
   every time you come.

377
00:13:56,119 --> 00:13:57,418
You're sticking
 to the traditions.

378
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,554
You're upgrading
the program where you can,

379
00:13:59,556 --> 00:14:00,755
and you really
 embody this.

380
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:02,957
You really celebrate it.
  Fantastic.

381
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,393
This guy.

382
00:14:05,395 --> 00:14:07,128
Up next in Minneapolis...

383
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:08,863
That's crazy.

384
00:14:08,865 --> 00:14:10,798
...this deli's
  laying it on thick.

385
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,634
You own this.
 You own this.

386
00:14:12,636 --> 00:14:15,136
But you won't believe
 what they're leaving out.

387
00:14:15,138 --> 00:14:16,404
This is, like, groundbreaking
 stuff here, bud.

388
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:27,882
So, what the show
   is called

389
00:14:27,884 --> 00:14:29,250
is "Diners, Drive-Ins,
   and Dives,"

390
00:14:29,252 --> 00:14:31,753
but what it really is,
 it's just a trip to Flavortown.

391
00:14:31,755 --> 00:14:32,954
We're looking
   for real food

392
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:35,156
by real people
  all across the country,

393
00:14:35,158 --> 00:14:36,858
and now
  all around the world.

394
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,960
So here we are
 in Minneapolis, Minnesota,

395
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:41,896
to check out the one and the
 only that I've ever heard of.

396
00:14:41,898 --> 00:14:43,798
This is
 the Herbivorous Butcher.

397
00:14:46,436 --> 00:14:48,636
Sliced meats
     everywhere.
 I need some jerky.

398
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:50,338
But, of course,
   it's all plant-based.

399
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,574
This is the only vegan butcher
   shop I've ever been to.

400
00:14:52,576 --> 00:14:54,275
I feel like they're
    changing the world.

401
00:14:54,277 --> 00:14:56,477
But for siblings
  Aubrey and Kale Walch,

402
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:59,013
it all started with
  very personal changes

403
00:14:59,015 --> 00:15:00,048
back in their teens.

404
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:01,449
For me, it was
  for ethical reasons.

405
00:15:01,451 --> 00:15:03,751
Ethical reasons.
Yeah, for me,
it was for health.

406
00:15:03,753 --> 00:15:05,486
Health reasons.
 My nickname
 was butterball.

407
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:07,622
So they started making
   meat-free meats

408
00:15:07,624 --> 00:15:09,123
and cheese-free cheeses,

409
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:12,460
first selling at local
 farmers markets in 2014,

410
00:15:12,462 --> 00:15:13,628
and then, less than
  two years later,

411
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:15,363
had their own
   takeout joint.

412
00:15:15,365 --> 00:15:16,831
They want people
who eat meat to say,

413
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,600
"This looks like what
 I'm used to eating,

414
00:15:18,602 --> 00:15:20,435
and I can still eat it
 and enjoy it."

415
00:15:20,437 --> 00:15:21,836
Turkey dill Havarti!

416
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:24,906
The turkey sandwich
    tastes amazing.

417
00:15:24,908 --> 00:15:26,174
So, what are we
 gonna make first?

418
00:15:26,176 --> 00:15:27,675
This'll be
    the vegan turkey.

419
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:29,010
I'll start with
   the vital wheat gluten.

420
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:31,145
It's a 95%
    protein flour.

421
00:15:31,147 --> 00:15:33,648
This is traditional
yeast flakes, some onion powder.

422
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:35,483
And these are recipes
that you just developed.

423
00:15:35,485 --> 00:15:38,218
Yes. We've got sea salt,
   and this is some thyme.

424
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,988
It's some thyme.

425
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:41,789
When is it gonna
get the turkey flavor?

426
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:44,325
A lot of it comes from
 housemade chicken broth powder.

427
00:15:44,327 --> 00:15:48,029
We take nutritional yeast,
   thyme, sage, turmeric,

428
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:51,232
salt, mix it with water.

429
00:15:51,234 --> 00:15:52,900
Just like Mom
    used to make.

430
00:15:52,902 --> 00:15:54,235
Instant flavor.

431
00:15:54,237 --> 00:15:55,269
Got some olive oil
     so it

432
00:15:55,271 --> 00:15:57,405
doesn't turn out
    like a sponge.

433
00:15:57,407 --> 00:16:00,208
Soy sauce for a little
    bit more depth.

434
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:03,711
This is the turkey.

435
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:06,748
We will wrap it
 in its cheesecloth home here.

436
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,116
What do we do
  with that?

437
00:16:08,118 --> 00:16:11,052
This goes into boiling water
 for about an hour and a half.

438
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:12,353
Cooks it
all the way through.

439
00:16:12,355 --> 00:16:13,388
Bake it for another
    ten minutes.

440
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,956
Dries it out
 a little bit.

441
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:17,058
Then we add some soy sauce
  and olive oil on top of it.

442
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,292
To give
it a little texture.
      Yeah.

443
00:16:18,294 --> 00:16:19,827
Give a little color
 to the outside.

444
00:16:19,829 --> 00:16:21,596
Yep.
 And then you go
and slice it from there.

445
00:16:21,598 --> 00:16:23,698
Slice it ready.

446
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,466
So, this is your deli
 meat right here.

447
00:16:25,468 --> 00:16:27,368
That's
    the deli turkey.

448
00:16:28,772 --> 00:16:30,405
It's got texture.

449
00:16:30,407 --> 00:16:33,708
It's moist, and it's not rubber,
and it's not a sponge.

450
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:36,411
I'm impressed.
 I'm trippin'.
      Let's do
     the cheese.

451
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:38,279
What are we
  making now?
     Dill Havarti.

452
00:16:38,281 --> 00:16:40,081
We start with
   the coconut oil base,

453
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,150
soy milk, lemon juice
  in a white wine vinegar.

454
00:16:42,152 --> 00:16:44,752
It helps to emulsify it.
   Put that in a blender.

455
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:47,455
Next up.
    We got tapioca
  flour, Kappa carrageenan,

456
00:16:47,457 --> 00:16:48,856
so it's
     a seaweed.
 Oh. I was..

457
00:16:48,858 --> 00:16:51,059
It helps solidify
     the cheese.

458
00:16:51,061 --> 00:16:53,628
Nutritional yeast flakes,
     sea salt.

459
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:55,029
And that's
    the white miso.

460
00:16:55,031 --> 00:16:56,998
That's basically
the flavor foundation.

461
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,132
Pretty much.

462
00:17:00,737 --> 00:17:03,104
Onto the stove.
    It's fresh dill.

463
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:04,839
Heated up.
 Thicken it up.

464
00:17:04,841 --> 00:17:06,140
It cools in
   the fridge overnight,

465
00:17:06,142 --> 00:17:08,810
and then it solidifies
    into a solid block.

466
00:17:08,812 --> 00:17:11,746
Wow.
 That's crazy.

467
00:17:11,748 --> 00:17:12,914
Okay, make a sandwich?

468
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:13,815
All right, yeah.
Let's do it.

469
00:17:13,817 --> 00:17:16,818
We've got
    our garlic mayo.

470
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:19,387
Got dijon mustard,
  throw some turkey on there.

471
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:24,926
The dill Havarti, best part --
  throw some lettuce on here.

472
00:17:24,928 --> 00:17:28,129
Tomatoes and ze onion.

473
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:29,597
All right.

474
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,565
Jump in.

475
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:36,237
I'd eat it
 all day long.

476
00:17:36,239 --> 00:17:37,638
Fresh veggies,

477
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,708
a good amount of moisturizer
with the vegan mayo.

478
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:42,777
We're eating it
on a fantastic roll.

479
00:17:42,779 --> 00:17:44,612
You definitely get
the creaminess of the cheese.

480
00:17:44,614 --> 00:17:47,048
You get that chew,
you get that texture,

481
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:50,485
that meaty texture
coming through from the turkey.

482
00:17:50,487 --> 00:17:51,619
Fantastic.

483
00:17:53,189 --> 00:17:54,622
We got a line
   out here.

484
00:17:54,624 --> 00:17:55,656
It's so good.

485
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:57,291
The dill Havarti
  is off the hook.

486
00:17:57,293 --> 00:17:59,627
The turkey is flavored
 really well.

487
00:17:59,629 --> 00:18:00,928
The texture of the feel,

488
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:02,897
everything about it
  is just like meat.

489
00:18:02,899 --> 00:18:05,466
How do you get different
textures in different meats?

490
00:18:05,468 --> 00:18:06,901
It's different ratios,

491
00:18:06,903 --> 00:18:08,603
and we use
   different bean flours

492
00:18:08,605 --> 00:18:10,071
to create
    different textures.

493
00:18:10,073 --> 00:18:11,939
This is like, groundbreaking,
 stuff here, bud.

494
00:18:11,941 --> 00:18:13,975
Yeah, well,
    we're trying.

495
00:18:13,977 --> 00:18:15,443
And wait till you
   see the texture

496
00:18:15,445 --> 00:18:18,212
he's mixing up for
the three meats on this monster.

497
00:18:18,214 --> 00:18:19,313
Italian cold cut
  is amazing.

498
00:18:19,315 --> 00:18:21,682
Just packed with
  so many good things.

499
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:23,117
This is one of my
    pride and joys.

500
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:25,620
So you're saying
the turkey was dynamite,

501
00:18:25,622 --> 00:18:27,588
but the pastrami
  is legit.

502
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:29,857
It's my favorite.

503
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:32,827
Tomato juice, Liquid Smoke,
    got some water.

504
00:18:32,829 --> 00:18:35,129
Next up -- soy sauce.
Plenty of olive oil.

505
00:18:35,131 --> 00:18:37,431
Pastrami is
 a nice, juicy meat.

506
00:18:37,433 --> 00:18:38,966
Tomato paste.

507
00:18:38,968 --> 00:18:41,736
Lots of garlic.
     White miso.

508
00:18:41,738 --> 00:18:43,538
Next dry ingredients --
 vital wheat gluten,

509
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,840
nutritional yeast flakes,
 red beet powder.

510
00:18:45,842 --> 00:18:47,642
Gives it a nice color,
 a little sweetness.

511
00:18:47,644 --> 00:18:49,377
This is agar-agar.

512
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:51,012
Another seaweed
 like carrageenan.

513
00:18:51,014 --> 00:18:53,014
Agar-agar?
 Agar-agar.
  Yeah.

514
00:18:53,016 --> 00:18:54,415
They just couldn't use
     one agar?

515
00:18:54,417 --> 00:18:56,083
No, it's so good,
they had to name it twice.

516
00:18:56,085 --> 00:18:59,020
Ground mustard.
You've got basil and oregano.

517
00:18:59,022 --> 00:19:03,257
Smoked paprika,
sea salt, onion powder,

518
00:19:03,259 --> 00:19:05,459
and the fennel
 and peppercorns.

519
00:19:05,461 --> 00:19:07,295
Mix all this together.

520
00:19:07,297 --> 00:19:10,031
Wow. Okay.

521
00:19:10,033 --> 00:19:11,299
Right in.
 Right in.

522
00:19:11,301 --> 00:19:13,367
Looks like ground beef.
     Crazy.

523
00:19:13,369 --> 00:19:15,436
Throw it on here. This will
  all go into the steamer?

524
00:19:15,438 --> 00:19:16,704
Yep.
    How long is it
    gonna steam for?

525
00:19:16,706 --> 00:19:18,072
Steams for an hour.

526
00:19:19,475 --> 00:19:21,509
Bakes for another half-hour,
then you let it cool.

527
00:19:21,511 --> 00:19:22,844
Bring it out,
  and you slice from there.

528
00:19:22,846 --> 00:19:24,345
Yep.

529
00:19:24,347 --> 00:19:27,215
All right. Got that same garlic
  mayo we put on the turkey.

530
00:19:27,217 --> 00:19:28,850
Oregano,
   salt, and pepper here.

531
00:19:28,852 --> 00:19:30,017
Oh, I'm so excited.

532
00:19:30,019 --> 00:19:32,854
So, we got that pastrami,
   capicola, salty ham,

533
00:19:32,856 --> 00:19:34,455
we got the pepperoni
    in there, too.

534
00:19:34,457 --> 00:19:38,226
And this is our mozzarella
    cheese, lettuce.

535
00:19:38,228 --> 00:19:40,094
Got some onions.
      Red onion.

536
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:42,830
Cherry peppers,
    oil and vinegar.

537
00:19:42,832 --> 00:19:43,998
Let's see if I can
    get this one shut.

538
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,868
You own this.
 You own this.

539
00:19:53,343 --> 00:19:54,442
No way.

540
00:19:54,444 --> 00:19:55,977
I'm picking up
the notes of the smoke.

541
00:19:55,979 --> 00:19:58,946
I'm picking up
 the notes of the pepper.

542
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:00,514
You're the Columbus
 of this, man.

543
00:20:00,516 --> 00:20:02,383
You guys are gonna dig it.
  Trust me.

544
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,119
Delicious.

545
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:07,355
I, of course, drag one
of my buddies in on this.

546
00:20:07,357 --> 00:20:08,923
My buddy
 Craig Scanlon.

547
00:20:08,925 --> 00:20:10,858
I could not believe the texture,
 followed up with the flavor.

548
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:13,094
It tastes like
    a cold cut Italian.

549
00:20:13,096 --> 00:20:14,662
It's a little bit
  of sweet and spicy.

550
00:20:14,664 --> 00:20:16,430
They're definitely
    onto something.

551
00:20:16,432 --> 00:20:18,599
I came here
with my own level of skepticism,

552
00:20:18,601 --> 00:20:21,135
but I would not be
 steering you wrong

553
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:22,937
telling you to come in here
 and try this.

554
00:20:22,939 --> 00:20:24,939
It's fantastic.
 Congratulations.

555
00:20:24,941 --> 00:20:26,240
Thanks.

556
00:20:28,011 --> 00:20:30,878
So, was that another
 righteous road trip or what?

557
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,280
But don't you worry.

558
00:20:32,282 --> 00:20:34,815
We got plenty more joints
 to find all over this country.

559
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:36,484
I'll be looking
  for you next week

560
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:38,920
on "Diners, Drive-ins,
   and Dives."

561
00:20:38,922 --> 00:20:40,521
After we shock it,
then we squeeze the lemon in.

562
00:20:40,523 --> 00:20:42,423
Shock it? Like,
    as in Chaka Khan?

563
00:20:42,425 --> 00:20:43,624
Like Shaka-shaka.

564
00:20:43,626 --> 00:20:45,927
Shaka!

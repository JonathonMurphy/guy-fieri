1
00:00:01,535 --> 00:00:03,435
Hey, there.
   I'm Guy Fieri,

2
00:00:03,437 --> 00:00:04,470
and we're rolling out

3
00:00:04,472 --> 00:00:06,205
looking for America's
  greatest diners,

4
00:00:06,207 --> 00:00:07,773
drive-ins, and dives.
   This trip...

5
00:00:07,775 --> 00:00:08,974
Here we go.

6
00:00:08,976 --> 00:00:10,943
...we're going coast
  to coast, port to port.

7
00:00:10,945 --> 00:00:12,244
Make it happen, baby.

8
00:00:12,246 --> 00:00:13,946
In Portland, Oregon...

9
00:00:13,948 --> 00:00:14,880
Holy moly!

10
00:00:14,882 --> 00:00:16,115
...a neighborhood market...

11
00:00:16,117 --> 00:00:17,182
This is a haven.

12
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:19,318
...getting comfy
 with the family cookbook.

13
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,720
Grandma Holly,
   you taught him right.

14
00:00:21,722 --> 00:00:23,689
Plus, a straight-up
   Spanish spot...

15
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:25,290
It's a whole symphony
  of flavor.

16
00:00:25,292 --> 00:00:27,493
...making tapas a true art form.

17
00:00:27,495 --> 00:00:28,994
One of the most
 beautiful dishes

18
00:00:28,996 --> 00:00:30,362
I've ever seen
 on "Triple D."

19
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:32,064
And in Portsmouth,
  New Hampshire...

20
00:00:32,066 --> 00:00:33,565
Drop it like it's...
   -...hot.

21
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:34,800
...I'm teaming up with Hunter

22
00:00:34,802 --> 00:00:37,102
for a pork platter
   like no other.

23
00:00:37,104 --> 00:00:38,570
It's not a bad thing.

24
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:40,005
It's a fantastic thing.

25
00:00:40,007 --> 00:00:41,907
That's all right here,
   right now,

26
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:44,777
on "Diners, Drive-ins & Dives."

27
00:00:56,057 --> 00:00:58,791
So, we're here in Portsmouth,
   New Hampshire.

28
00:00:58,793 --> 00:01:00,959
And I finally get to drive
    the "Triple D" car.

29
00:01:00,961 --> 00:01:02,694
So, I figured
  why not take Hunter

30
00:01:02,696 --> 00:01:04,596
to get some real-deal
   Mexican food

31
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:05,798
here on the east coast.

32
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,499
Mexican food?
  East coast?

33
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:09,468
Listen, the dude's
 from southern California.

34
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:10,702
Oh, so he's got
 to be legit.

35
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:13,205
This is Vida Cantina.

36
00:01:15,976 --> 00:01:17,709
Blue-corn
  fried shrimp tacos.

37
00:01:17,711 --> 00:01:19,545
You can't find better Mexican
 in New England, anywhere.

38
00:01:19,547 --> 00:01:21,246
- Chicken enchilada.
  -I can definitely see

39
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:22,714
the heritage
 coming though on the table.

40
00:01:22,716 --> 00:01:24,817
You feel like you're getting
 a unique Mexican experience.

41
00:01:24,819 --> 00:01:27,586
And owner David Vargas
 has a good base to build from

42
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:29,788
'cause his parents ran
  a Mexican restaurant

43
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,757
when he was a kid
  in Orange County.

44
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,660
I grew up eating the traditional
American/Mexican foods.

45
00:01:34,662 --> 00:01:36,095
There's no disrespect
 against that,

46
00:01:36,097 --> 00:01:38,163
but there's something
more traditional that

47
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:39,631
we want to bring
 to the table.

48
00:01:39,633 --> 00:01:42,634
So, he took many of
  his old family recipes

49
00:01:42,636 --> 00:01:45,571
and amped them up
 when he started his own joint.

50
00:01:45,573 --> 00:01:48,040
- Carnitas tacos.
  -I love the tacos.

51
00:01:48,042 --> 00:01:49,775
I've tried them all, and you
can't go wrong with any of them.

52
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:51,376
Pork belly tacos
   in the window.

53
00:01:51,378 --> 00:01:53,212
We do pork belly
    all the time here.

54
00:01:53,214 --> 00:01:56,248
It's pretty much a big piece
  of bacon on the taco.

55
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,749
So, Dave,
  give us a breakdown.

56
00:01:57,751 --> 00:02:00,185
We're gonna make the nixtamal
for our homemade tortillas.

57
00:02:00,187 --> 00:02:01,787
We start with
 some Indian corn

58
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:03,122
that we get from
 a local farm here.

59
00:02:03,124 --> 00:02:04,857
- You know what the nixtamal is?
   -I do not know.

60
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:06,959
What is nixtamal?
 -So, we're gonna use some lye.

61
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:09,895
- Little calcium hydroxide.
  -And some water.

62
00:02:09,897 --> 00:02:12,097
And let it cook
for about 45 minutes.

63
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:14,566
And it's gonna eat
 the skin off of the corn.

64
00:02:14,568 --> 00:02:16,235
We'll let it cool...
   -Overnight.

65
00:02:16,237 --> 00:02:18,203
We rinse it a bunch of times,
 so now you just really get

66
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:19,872
the flesh of the inside
   of the corn.

67
00:02:19,874 --> 00:02:22,107
Then, take it to the grinder.
   -Pretty cool.

68
00:02:22,109 --> 00:02:24,309
I've never seen that
    like that. Wow.

69
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:25,878
So, from here,
 we add in...

70
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,412
A little processed masa flour.

71
00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:28,480
Mm-hmm.

72
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:29,481
We're gonna add
 a little warm water

73
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:30,983
with shortening
 and salt in it.

74
00:02:30,985 --> 00:02:32,384
You have to do it
 while it's hot.

75
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:34,052
You to drop it
    like it's hot, too.

76
00:02:34,054 --> 00:02:36,722
Yeah. Drop it like it's...
   -...hot.

77
00:02:36,724 --> 00:02:39,057
- Drop it like it's...
   -...hot.

78
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:40,526
All right, Chef.
    What's next?

79
00:02:40,528 --> 00:02:42,094
Our pork belly.

80
00:02:42,096 --> 00:02:44,296
We basically do
 an eight-day cure.

81
00:02:44,298 --> 00:02:46,865
We start off -- black pepper.
 Crushed garlic.

82
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:48,200
What we like to
 call "boom" spice.

83
00:02:48,202 --> 00:02:49,601
It's our secret
  spice here.

84
00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:51,203
Salt.
 -Fresh bay leaves in there.

85
00:02:51,205 --> 00:02:53,372
Pink salt.
  Thyme.

86
00:02:53,374 --> 00:02:55,874
- Time.
   -Th-yme.

87
00:02:55,876 --> 00:02:57,142
Oh.

88
00:02:57,144 --> 00:02:58,577
And then epazote.

89
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:00,512
- You know what epazote is?
 -No. I mean, I've heard of it.

90
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:02,181
In real cultural Mexican
   cooking...

91
00:03:02,183 --> 00:03:04,683
It's a very predominant
 Mexican herb.

92
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,118
And then maple syrup.

93
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,020
So that's almost gonna work
 as your paste, your glue.

94
00:03:08,022 --> 00:03:09,388
- Exactly.
   -I like it.

95
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:10,622
Just rub it down.

96
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:12,624
Then after it's done...?

97
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:15,694
and then put it
 in its own lard.

98
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:18,897
Cook it for eight hours.
   -Dig it.

99
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:20,265
Wow,
    that looks awesome.

100
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:21,600
We have to let it
  solidify,

101
00:03:21,602 --> 00:03:24,836
so we put a couple pieces
of parchment, some weight.

102
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:26,605
So, that's just gonna
  sit there and press it

103
00:03:26,607 --> 00:03:28,307
right into its own fat.
   -Exactly.

104
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:30,042
How long's it gonna sit
    in the walk-in for?

105
00:03:30,044 --> 00:03:31,543
We like to go overnight.

106
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,445
So, this is all cool.
   Now what are we doing?

107
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:35,080
We have our masa
 that's finished.

108
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:38,784
How much do you use?
   Masa or lessa?

109
00:03:38,786 --> 00:03:41,687
- We'll go onto our flattop.
   -Nicely done.

110
00:03:41,689 --> 00:03:43,956
Then we'll take our pork belly,
cut it down right here.

111
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:45,857
Almost like big,
  fat bacon slices.

112
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:47,759
- And then we'll just cut them.
   -Gorgeous.

113
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:49,728
So, we're just gonna put
 a little crisp on it, right?

114
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,129
Yeah, nice carmelization

115
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:53,131
on both sides
to kind of add some texture.

116
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:54,566
Some more love.

117
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,802
We'll grab our tortillas,
 and you can see

118
00:03:56,804 --> 00:04:00,205
they're starting to do its
ever-so-popular puff on it.

119
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:02,574
We have a little bit of what
we call jicama slaw.

120
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:05,143
Put our pork belly
 right on top.

121
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:07,946
- Ahh.
  -Mango habanero salsa.

122
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:09,047
Cotija cheese,

123
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:11,650
which I call the Mexican
version of Parmesan.

124
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:13,518
And then everything
 this time of year

125
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,886
gets flowers
 on top of it.

126
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:16,355
- Flowers?
   -Everything.

127
00:04:16,357 --> 00:04:17,623
- Got it.
   -Awesome.

128
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:18,857
All right, ready?

129
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:22,361
You want to go arm around
   when you do it or...

130
00:04:22,363 --> 00:04:23,562
Wait.
    I'm confused.

131
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:25,297
I fed you enough when
you were a little kid.

132
00:04:25,299 --> 00:04:28,333
There you go.

133
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:29,801
That is awesome.

134
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:33,005
The fresh tortilla
    totally makes it.

135
00:04:33,007 --> 00:04:34,306
I love the slaw.

136
00:04:34,308 --> 00:04:37,042
That pork belly's just
   cooked perfectly, too.

137
00:04:37,044 --> 00:04:38,610
Yeah, I could eat that
   all day.

138
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,812
So, the tortilla --
you can taste that nixtamal.

139
00:04:40,814 --> 00:04:42,347
You can taste
 how fresh it is.

140
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:44,049
There's fantastic
 texture in it.

141
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:46,018
The cotija, I like that
 little saltiness.

142
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,654
The pork is really
the note that sings,

143
00:04:48,656 --> 00:04:50,622
and you do it in such
a nice, fat slab that

144
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,658
you're really getting
some meaty texture in it.

145
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,660
If you told me
 I was getting this

146
00:04:54,662 --> 00:04:56,228
at a contemporary
 Mexican restaurant

147
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,796
in San Diego,
I would believe you.

148
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:00,699
Fantastic.
  Mmm!

149
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:01,900
Pork belly tacos.

150
00:05:01,902 --> 00:05:04,136
The pork belly
 is real thick, real juicy.

151
00:05:04,138 --> 00:05:06,772
The mango sauce is awesome --
 a little hot, a little sweet.

152
00:05:06,774 --> 00:05:08,907
The corn tortilla's
 really fresh, delicious flavor.

153
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:10,208
Bone marrow steak
    in the window.

154
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:12,477
This place goes above and beyond
 what you would think of.

155
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,413
This actually used to be
  an old fast-food joint,

156
00:05:14,415 --> 00:05:17,015
and when people walk in, they're
 amazed at the transformation.

157
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:20,619
It's bright, colorful.
It's got this good energy to it.

158
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:24,089
When they have koozies
for your canned Mexican beer,

159
00:05:24,091 --> 00:05:27,793
you know that there's a slight
party attitude around here.

160
00:05:27,795 --> 00:05:29,594
They have things that
 I've never even experienced,

161
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:30,996
especially the pig's head.

162
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:33,031
We put the head on a platter,
and we serve it just like that,

163
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:34,599
and people build their own tacos
  that way.

164
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:37,202
That's awesome. We got
 to get a pig head platter.

165
00:05:37,204 --> 00:05:38,904
- Go at it.
  -When we come back.

166
00:05:47,815 --> 00:05:49,114
Welcome back.
  "Triple D."

167
00:05:49,116 --> 00:05:50,615
Hunter is leading the show

168
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:53,218
on the Hunter and Guy
"Triple D" experience.

169
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,453
We're at Vida Cantina.

170
00:05:54,455 --> 00:05:56,855
Chef David here
in Portsmouth, New Hampshire,

171
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,824
is bringing real-deal
 Mexican food

172
00:05:58,826 --> 00:05:59,991
to the folks
 of the northeast.

173
00:05:59,993 --> 00:06:02,894
Fire -- table 31.
  Two fried shrimp tacos.

174
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:05,497
You can't get anything like it
  anywhere else in town.

175
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:07,132
I'm so intrigued
    by the menu.

176
00:06:07,134 --> 00:06:08,633
Pig head platter
   in the window.

177
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:09,968
It's literally a pig's head,

178
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,570
homemade corn tortillas
   on the side.

179
00:06:11,572 --> 00:06:13,605
It's kind of like have
  a pulled pork taco,

180
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:16,108
but it's more experiential.

181
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,309
Let me just
  get this straight.

182
00:06:17,311 --> 00:06:21,246
We're talking full
  split-in-half pig head.

183
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:22,447
Yeah.

184
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:24,816
Where's Andrew Zimmern
  when you need him?

185
00:06:24,818 --> 00:06:25,884
Hit it!

186
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,219
All right, we're
 gonna make a brine.

187
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:29,888
Some water, sugar, salt.

188
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,557
- A little curing salt.
 -And a little bit of garlic.

189
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:33,792
And then, once it
 comes to a boil,

190
00:06:33,794 --> 00:06:36,128
we put it into the walk-in.
  -Cool this down.

191
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:38,363
Take the brine and pour it
 right on the head.

192
00:06:38,365 --> 00:06:39,664
You got
   to clean him up there.

193
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,466
So, he's gonna
  sit there and brine...

194
00:06:41,468 --> 00:06:43,335
- For a couple days.
  -Then what's next?

195
00:06:43,337 --> 00:06:44,736
We'll take it out,
 give it a rinse,

196
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:45,971
and let it cook
  in its fat.

197
00:06:45,973 --> 00:06:47,539
Basically, confit the head.

198
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,875
Exactly, eight hours.

199
00:06:49,877 --> 00:06:51,443
- Dude.
  -Then it comes out.

200
00:06:51,445 --> 00:06:53,879
We let it cool slightly,
rub it with our salsa verde.

201
00:06:53,881 --> 00:06:56,848
It's grilled tomatillos,
 poblanos, serrano,

202
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,884
cilantro,
 onion, and garlic.

203
00:06:58,886 --> 00:07:01,319
And then, we fire it off
in a 500-degree oven,

204
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:04,089
uncovered so it blisters
the skin, for about 20 minutes.

205
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:06,258
So, you're gonna get it
 the chicharrones of the skin,

206
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:10,028
and then everything inside
  is just cooked down.

207
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,363
- Bring it onto the platter.
   -Oh, wow.

208
00:07:11,365 --> 00:07:13,198
Look at that.

209
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,566
We'll serve it
 with cilantro,

210
00:07:14,568 --> 00:07:17,803
onions, lime,
our house-made salsa fresco,

211
00:07:17,805 --> 00:07:19,905
salsa verde,
 and mango habanero.

212
00:07:19,907 --> 00:07:22,007
And then, of course...
   -Flowers.

213
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:23,942
And a stack of
our house-made tortillas.

214
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:27,245
And then,
 you just go at it.

215
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:29,014
- Where do you start?
  -You just dig in.

216
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:30,882
- Oh, look at that.
  -I'm getting in this.

217
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:32,551
Look at that.
  Right into that jowl.

218
00:07:32,553 --> 00:07:35,387
- It just pulls apart, huh?
   -Look at that.

219
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:38,223
So, you grab a tortilla.
   -Oh, man.

220
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:41,493
That's about as real-deal
 as it gets, right there.

221
00:07:41,495 --> 00:07:43,462
- Mm-hmm.
  -It's not a bad thing.

222
00:07:43,464 --> 00:07:44,896
It's a fantastic thing.

223
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:46,832
I know it's got to be
 a little unique for people

224
00:07:46,834 --> 00:07:48,900
to have this culinary
   experience,

225
00:07:48,902 --> 00:07:50,402
but the truth of it is,

226
00:07:50,404 --> 00:07:53,371
the flavor
  when you got the skin,

227
00:07:53,373 --> 00:07:56,408
the bone, the fat, the brine,

228
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:59,010
and the roast with that salsa
 verde over the top of it,

229
00:07:59,012 --> 00:08:00,846
I mean, that's ridiculous.
  -So much flavor.

230
00:08:00,848 --> 00:08:04,516
That's one of the most beautiful
 presentations of roasted pork

231
00:08:04,518 --> 00:08:05,817
I've ever seen.
  -Thank you very much.

232
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,886
That one for me?

233
00:08:07,888 --> 00:08:09,988
Thank you.
    Appreciate it, Dad.

234
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,189
Even when they're
  taller than you,

235
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:12,524
you still end up feeding them.

236
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:16,795
Here we go.

237
00:08:16,797 --> 00:08:18,196
The best pulled pork
  you're gonna get.

238
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:19,564
So succulent when
  you bite into it.

239
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:20,765
It's an awesome experience.

240
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:22,534
Runner on table 42,
     please.

241
00:08:22,536 --> 00:08:26,972
What you've done is transformed
 a small area of New Hampshire

242
00:08:26,974 --> 00:08:29,641
into little cultural Mexico.

243
00:08:29,643 --> 00:08:31,276
- It's awesome.
   -Thank you.

244
00:08:31,278 --> 00:08:32,677
- Nice job, Chef.
   -Thank you.

245
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:35,080
I got to head over here
  and try some more.

246
00:08:36,783 --> 00:08:37,883
Wow.

247
00:08:39,653 --> 00:08:41,486
Cg up, we're
  crossing the country

248
00:08:41,488 --> 00:08:43,255
to Portland, Oregon...
    -Wow!

249
00:08:43,257 --> 00:08:45,090
...to a market/restaurant...

250
00:08:45,092 --> 00:08:46,391
That is crazy.

251
00:08:46,393 --> 00:08:49,160
...dishing out something
 I've never quite seen before.

252
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:50,362
This is getting
    weirder as we go.

253
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:55,834
I used to use a nixtamatic
 to put you to bed at night.

254
00:08:55,836 --> 00:08:57,235
Me?

255
00:08:57,237 --> 00:09:00,138
I would run that in your room,
  and it was so soothing.

256
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,309
I'm here on the northeast side
  of Portland, Oregon,

257
00:09:04,311 --> 00:09:06,478
wn and you'd love it.

258
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,780
There's a total community feel,
  a lot of family homes.

259
00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:11,449
So, on the corner
  of Dekum and 13th,

260
00:09:11,451 --> 00:09:13,485
you'll find a market
 that's supporting all that.

261
00:09:13,487 --> 00:09:17,589
This is P's & Q's Market.

262
00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:19,057
Basic breakfast
     with eggs.

263
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,926
There are 96
 neighborhoods in Portland,

264
00:09:20,928 --> 00:09:22,961
and 95 of those
 neighborhoods are jealous

265
00:09:22,963 --> 00:09:24,462
that they don't
   have P's & Q's.

266
00:09:24,464 --> 00:09:26,998
From the moment I stepped in,
 I fell in love with this place.

267
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,400
BLT.

268
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:30,335
Is it a grocery store?
 Is it a market?

269
00:09:30,337 --> 00:09:33,038
Is it a restaurant?
Is it a shoe-repair place?

270
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,006
It's everything.
  It's a community center,

271
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:37,108
just bringing people
   together through food.

272
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,744
I feel like he's gonna
break into song with a guitar,

273
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:42,747
and he's gonna sing me
a '60s love album or something.

274
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,683
And when Paul Davis
  and Emily Anderson

275
00:09:44,685 --> 00:09:45,717
opened this place,

276
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:47,552
they added to
  the small-town vibe

277
00:09:47,554 --> 00:09:49,454
with recipes from their roots.

278
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:50,855
I'm from northern California.

279
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:53,725
I'm really into seasonal
   fresh produce.

280
00:09:53,727 --> 00:09:56,127
- I'm from Kansas City.
 -What kind of food is it?

281
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:57,596
It's definite
    comfort food.

282
00:09:57,598 --> 00:09:59,898
Biscuits
    and tomato gravy.

283
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,199
Tomato gravy, seriously?

284
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:02,867
Yeah, it's
   my grandma's recipe.

285
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:04,369
She's from
    West Virginia.

286
00:10:04,371 --> 00:10:05,470
Oh, this I got to see.

287
00:10:05,472 --> 00:10:06,871
Here's the biscuits and gravy.

288
00:10:06,873 --> 00:10:08,940
The tomato gravy is heads
  and shoulders above

289
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,542
any other gravy I know.

290
00:10:10,544 --> 00:10:13,745
And the biscuit
  from here is amazing.

291
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:14,846
All right,
    what are we making?

292
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:15,947
We're starting off
 with biscuits.

293
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,549
I'm gonna mix
the dry ingredients,

294
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:19,117
starting with flour.

295
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,418
Add the salt.

296
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,721
Cream of tartar.
 And baking soda.

297
00:10:22,723 --> 00:10:26,024
And last, chilled butter.
I'm gonna dump this out.

298
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:28,593
Now we're gonna add
our buttermilk and cream.

299
00:10:28,595 --> 00:10:30,428
I like the crockware
     and all.

300
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,430
Now I'm gonna fold
  these over.

301
00:10:32,432 --> 00:10:33,832
Mess with them
   as little as possible.

302
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:35,634
Now I'm gonna start
 rolling it out.

303
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:37,502
Right now, on 1 to 10,
    are we excited?

304
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:38,603
Or are we mellow?

305
00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:40,138
Even keel --
 that's how I roll.

306
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,606
You always run it
     at a five?

307
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:43,441
Does anything
    get you rattled?

308
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:45,310
What happens when somebody

309
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:48,246
doesn't deliver your
   produce order on time?

310
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:49,347
What does it sound like?

311
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:52,017
Could you be on time
 next time, please?

312
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:54,586
No, it's okay. It's okay.
 -"It's okay, it's okay."

313
00:10:54,588 --> 00:10:55,954
All these are gonna
   bake off at what temp?

314
00:10:55,956 --> 00:10:57,389
- 350.
   -350, how long?

315
00:10:57,391 --> 00:10:59,324
- 30 minutes.
 -And that's all she wrote.

316
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:02,527
So, this is Grandma Holly's
 tomato gravy.

317
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:03,795
Is she cool with the fact

318
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:05,630
that you're selling off
   the great gravy recipe?

319
00:11:05,632 --> 00:11:08,233
Yeah, she wanted
to tell you, "Hello."

320
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:10,001
She watches your show
 all the time.

321
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,269
Hi, Grandma.
   How you doing? Okay.

322
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:12,704
So, we're starting
     off with...

323
00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:15,240
- Bacon fat and the butter.
 -I don't think in my history,

324
00:11:15,242 --> 00:11:16,908
I've ever heard
    of a tomato gravy.

325
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,510
It's like this
 Appalachian thing.

326
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:19,811
Then
 we go to tomatoes.

327
00:11:19,813 --> 00:11:21,446
- Just regular crushed tomatoes?
    -Yep.

328
00:11:21,448 --> 00:11:23,481
Son, we're making tomato sauce,
   is what it looks like.

329
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:24,582
No.
  No, no, no.

330
00:11:24,584 --> 00:11:26,418
I have seen some
   weird stuff in my day.

331
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,752
This is
    taking the cake.

332
00:11:27,754 --> 00:11:30,388
We're just gonna
let this simmer for two hours.

333
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,523
It's reduced by half.

334
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:33,425
I'm gonna pour
in my evaporated milk.

335
00:11:33,427 --> 00:11:34,659
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

336
00:11:34,661 --> 00:11:36,027
You didn't say anything
   about evaporated milk.

337
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,162
That's going in here, too?
  -Yeah, evaporated milk.

338
00:11:37,164 --> 00:11:38,897
This is getting
    weirder as we go.

339
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:40,865
Then, my whole milk
that I'll mix with flour.

340
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:42,967
Both of them
 have been heated up

341
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:45,804
to change the protein
so that it doesn't break.

342
00:11:45,806 --> 00:11:46,905
Wow.

343
00:11:46,907 --> 00:11:48,006
Gonna add
 salt and pepper,

344
00:11:48,008 --> 00:11:50,175
and we're ready to plate.
   -Here we go.

345
00:11:50,177 --> 00:11:52,077
It's a good-looking biscuit.
   -Thank you.

346
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,545
It looks like
    chunky tomato soup.

347
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:56,047
Just a sprinkling
of parsley for some green.

348
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,716
And a little
    chopped-up bacon.
 Yeah.

349
00:11:59,453 --> 00:12:01,686
It's really dynamite.
  It's a really good biscuit.

350
00:12:01,688 --> 00:12:03,988
It has that velvetiness
   that a tomato soup has.

351
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:06,357
It's nice and mellow.
   It's a little sweet.

352
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:09,828
I do appreciate
  the bacon crackling on top.

353
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,463
Yeah, I can get down
   with this all day long.

354
00:12:11,465 --> 00:12:14,332
In the world of weird,
  you're running an 8.5 now.

355
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:16,434
- It's up there.
  -Grandma Holly...

356
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:18,002
top notch, girl.
   You taught him right.

357
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:20,171
Biscuits and tomato gravy up.

358
00:12:20,173 --> 00:12:22,006
Biscuits are really light,
   but the outside

359
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:23,908
still has some texture to it.

360
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,477
Biscuits
with tomato gravy --

361
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:26,644
ever heard of
 anything like that?

362
00:12:26,646 --> 00:12:28,379
No, I haven't.
   It's fantastic, though.

363
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:29,547
It's killer.

364
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:31,149
When you come
  to P's & Q's Market,

365
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:33,184
you're not just getting
  a food experience,

366
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:34,919
but you're getting
 a full market experience.

367
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:36,354
That was very intentional.

368
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:39,891
I wanted to bring part of that
 feeling from my hometown here.

369
00:12:39,893 --> 00:12:42,360
And also, we live a block away,
  so we really wanted

370
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:43,995
to have a little market
  in our neighborhood.

371
00:12:43,997 --> 00:12:46,197
You can buy toilet paper,
    ketchup, beer.

372
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:47,465
Toilet paper,
 ketchup are usually

373
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:48,900
on the top
 of my list, also.

374
00:12:48,902 --> 00:12:50,535
Great sandwiches,
     you know?

375
00:12:50,537 --> 00:12:52,237
This is
  the polenta sandwich.

376
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:53,671
I'm having the polenta sandwich.

377
00:12:53,673 --> 00:12:55,173
It's, like, totally beautiful.

378
00:12:55,175 --> 00:12:57,008
This polenta makes
   its own rules.

379
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:59,010
It's ridiculously good.

380
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:00,612
So, we're gonna
    make creamy polenta

381
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:01,946
for the polenta sandwich.

382
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:02,580
Yep.
We got some boiling water

383
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:04,949
ptao.
  for the polenta sandwich.

384
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:07,485
Now we're gonna let this
simmer for 30 minutes.

385
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:09,220
Okay, buddy.
    That thickened up.

386
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:11,489
Now I'm gonna add
my butter, Parmesan.

387
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:13,525
Holy moly!

388
00:13:13,527 --> 00:13:15,026
Oh, eee, oh.

389
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:17,061
Cream, salt.

390
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:19,030
We're ready to pour it
  in the pan.

391
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:20,198
You happy with that?

392
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,699
Now we're gonna throw this
 in the walk-in.

393
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:23,001
This will cool,
  and then,

394
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:25,436
we'll cut a square out of it,
 we'll fry that.

395
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:26,938
Oh, I like that.
    Okay, brother.

396
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,807
We're gonna assemble
the fried polenta sandwich.

397
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:31,810
Flame-roasted poblanos
down on the bottom bun.

398
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:33,444
Big old fried square
     of polenta.

399
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:36,347
Pickled red onions after that.
  Arugula.

400
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:37,916
And the top bun
 with mayonnaise.

401
00:13:37,918 --> 00:13:40,118
- And that's all she wrote.
  -That's all she wrote.

402
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:43,988
Wow.
    It's really good.

403
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,324
That polenta --
   that's actually great.

404
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,726
The baby Arugula is phenomenal
    right inside of it.

405
00:13:48,728 --> 00:13:50,361
Of course, the acid
    coming through

406
00:13:50,363 --> 00:13:52,397
from this red onion
     is spot on.

407
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,566
Mmm!

408
00:13:54,568 --> 00:13:56,034
Parmesan cheese
     gone wild.

409
00:13:56,036 --> 00:13:59,003
The pepper in there --
   that's the hidden gem.

410
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:01,706
My little sister would
  have loved that sandwich.

411
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,141
- I'm glad you like it.
 -Nicely done, my friend.

412
00:14:03,143 --> 00:14:04,209
Thanks.

413
00:14:04,211 --> 00:14:05,109
You got to come
    try that sandwich.

414
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:06,177
That is crazy.

415
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:08,479
- Polenta with fries up.
   -Thank you.

416
00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:10,415
- No problem.
  -It's super creamy.

417
00:14:10,417 --> 00:14:12,250
It has a nice,
  like, cheesy flavor,

418
00:14:12,252 --> 00:14:13,651
which I don't know
    how much cheese --

419
00:14:13,653 --> 00:14:15,320
'Cause there's about 400
pounds of Parmesan in it.

420
00:14:15,322 --> 00:14:18,056
So many flavors going on,
 you're trying to figure it out.

421
00:14:18,058 --> 00:14:19,324
It's impressive.

422
00:14:19,326 --> 00:14:22,660
P's & Q's is what Portland
  restaurants should be.

423
00:14:22,662 --> 00:14:24,095
Really, really,
really, really good.

424
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:25,897
- Was that four "reallys"?
    -Yeah.

425
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:28,399
It's a four "really goods."
   What else do you want?

426
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:30,034
This is where we'll
  eat all the time,

427
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:31,803
and this is where we can
  get our groceries.

428
00:14:31,805 --> 00:14:34,072
I mean, this is a haven.
Good food by great people.

429
00:14:34,074 --> 00:14:36,841
Congratulations.
   -Thank you.

430
00:14:36,843 --> 00:14:38,676
Up next, we're staying
  put in Portland...

431
00:14:38,678 --> 00:14:39,677
Whoa!

432
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:41,479
...to get a true taste of Spain.

433
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:42,780
This right here,
melts in your mouth.

434
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,486
You'd love it here. I mean,
 great c-- Great, great...

435
00:14:48,488 --> 00:14:51,256
great, great, great --
 there's a lot of great here.

436
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:56,794
I'm here in
 northwest Portland, Oregon,

437
00:14:56,796 --> 00:14:58,229
in an area known as 23rd.

438
00:14:58,231 --> 00:14:59,898
It's kind of like
  the restaurant row --

439
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,433
to check out a joint that's got
 a little bit of a love story.

440
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:04,535
Let's see, she's born
 and raised in Puerto Rico,

441
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:07,906
meets the guy in Barcelona,
 Spain, they get married,

442
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:10,508
move to the United States,
  come up to Portland...

443
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:11,876
well, and the rest is history.

444
00:15:11,878 --> 00:15:14,712
This is Ataula.

445
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:17,115
Here we have the bravas.

446
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:18,383
The food is amazing.

447
00:15:18,385 --> 00:15:20,151
It's the most unique
  restaurant in town.

448
00:15:20,153 --> 00:15:21,920
Going to table 45.

449
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:24,889
I mean, I'm from Spain,
 and when I come here, I'm home.

450
00:15:24,891 --> 00:15:27,258
'Cause this place
  is all about home.

451
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,427
Chef Jose Chesa
  grew up in Barcelona,

452
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:32,864
set out to serve up
 a true Spanish experience

453
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:35,533
when he opened the place
 with his wife, Cristina.

454
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:37,635
How do you describe great
Spanish food to people?

455
00:15:37,637 --> 00:15:38,903
Just pure flavor,

456
00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:40,872
cooking with the best
   possible ingredients.

457
00:15:40,874 --> 00:15:43,541
And of course, plenty of
  tapas taken up a notch.

458
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:45,310
All the dishes
  here invite sharing.

459
00:15:45,312 --> 00:15:46,844
Okay,
I'm finishing carpaccio.

460
00:15:46,846 --> 00:15:49,213
The pulpo carpaccio
   is octopus

461
00:15:49,215 --> 00:15:50,715
very, very thinly sliced.

462
00:15:50,717 --> 00:15:52,450
I've never had anything
 like this before in my life.

463
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,786
- It's like artwork on a plate.
 -So, let's get into this.

464
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:56,988
We'll always get
   the octopus from Spain.

465
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:59,023
We have some onions,
    black peppercorns,

466
00:15:59,025 --> 00:16:00,692
and we have the bay leaves.
   -And that's it?

467
00:16:00,694 --> 00:16:03,127
And then, it's really
 important you drop the octopus

468
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:05,830
into the boiling water
    for three times.

469
00:16:05,832 --> 00:16:08,900
Octopus take about 30,
     35 minutes.

470
00:16:08,902 --> 00:16:09,934
All the tentacles
   are being pulled out.

471
00:16:09,936 --> 00:16:12,136
Okay. And the sucker
 cups go, too?

472
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:13,237
Yeah.

473
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:14,405
So, now we're gonna
    add some agar

474
00:16:14,407 --> 00:16:16,441
to the boiling liquid
    from the octopus.

475
00:16:16,443 --> 00:16:17,976
- Thickening agent.
    -Yeah.

476
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:20,044
- Okay.
 -And then gelatin sheets.

477
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:21,212
You're gonna
 melt those in.

478
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:22,914
And now we have the tourine.

479
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:24,849
Okay, I grab
   the thickest tentacles.

480
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:27,752
So you have the first layer
  and repeat the same thing.

481
00:16:27,754 --> 00:16:30,588
- So, it's octopus Tetris.
    -Yes.

482
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:33,324
So, the goal is just to get it
as tight as you can in there,

483
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,226
but also
let there be the agar

484
00:16:35,228 --> 00:16:37,195
and the gelatin
to bind it together.

485
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:39,097
Which it is.
 You want to wrap up the sides,

486
00:16:39,099 --> 00:16:40,798
and we're gonna have
   a piece of cardboard.

487
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,067
Now, that seems pretty
technical right there.

488
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:44,502
You stack them
   on top of each other.

489
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:46,938
- How long is this gonna set up?
 -Overnight in the cooler.

490
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,674
Okay.

491
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:51,275
That's beautiful.

492
00:16:51,277 --> 00:16:53,711
We're gonna start
  with arbequina olive oil.

493
00:16:53,713 --> 00:16:55,380
Black olive tapenade.

494
00:16:55,382 --> 00:16:57,148
Sun-dried tomatoes.

495
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,750
Dr. Tweezer.
 Dr. Tweezer.

496
00:16:58,752 --> 00:17:00,051
That's gorgeous, dude.
 I'm telling you.

497
00:17:00,053 --> 00:17:01,586
Parmesan reggiano.

498
00:17:01,588 --> 00:17:04,255
Toasted pine nuts.
   Spanish hot paprika.

499
00:17:04,257 --> 00:17:06,391
And then we have
   an olive oil caviar.

500
00:17:06,393 --> 00:17:08,026
Is it olive oil
 or is it fish?

501
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:10,228
No, it's olive oil.
    Oregon sea salt.

502
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,930
Decorate with some
    edible flowers.

503
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:14,899
And then we finish
   with some pea shoots.

504
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:16,134
It's done.

505
00:17:20,974 --> 00:17:22,807
I don't think I've ever
had octopus that tender.

506
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:24,375
This right here,
melts in your mouth.

507
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:25,943
It's a whole symphony
  of flavors.

508
00:17:25,945 --> 00:17:26,911
The pine nut.
    -Yeah.

509
00:17:26,913 --> 00:17:28,479
That nuttiness
 of the Parmesan.

510
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:30,548
It's fantastic.
 It's balanced.

511
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:33,117
It's creative.
 Really dynamite.

512
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:35,153
One of the most
 beautiful dishes

513
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:36,387
I've ever seen
 on "Triple D."

514
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,122
Outstanding.

515
00:17:38,124 --> 00:17:40,558
Jose's octopus
  really compares well

516
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,660
to the best places in Barcelona.

517
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:44,929
Every once in a while,
we get the blast from the past,

518
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:47,231
like the famous
 Chef Benny Lin

519
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:49,033
from North Pole, Alaska.

520
00:17:49,035 --> 00:17:51,169
What do you think?
  -Oh, my goodness.

521
00:17:51,171 --> 00:17:55,239
It's so tender
  and has all the flavors.

522
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:56,607
Amazing.

523
00:17:56,609 --> 00:17:58,609
Everything is beautifully
prepared, beautifully presented.

524
00:17:58,611 --> 00:18:01,345
And meticulously
 researched, 'cause every year,

525
00:18:01,347 --> 00:18:04,715
Jose and Cristina head
 back to Barcelona to sharpen

526
00:18:04,717 --> 00:18:05,817
their culinary chops.

527
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:08,019
Keeping the foodis .

528
00:18:08,021 --> 00:18:09,554
And Jose has brought a lot

529
00:18:09,556 --> 00:18:12,390
of his childhood flavors
   to this space.

530
00:18:12,392 --> 00:18:15,193
Like a sandwich he says
 he was obsessed with as a kid.

531
00:18:15,195 --> 00:18:16,694
Pepita in the window, please.

532
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:19,464
This is melt in your mouth,
  unbelievably good.

533
00:18:19,466 --> 00:18:21,766
It's an other-worldly
   experience.

534
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:22,967
All right, Chef.
 What's next?

535
00:18:22,969 --> 00:18:25,570
The veal stock
    for the pepita.

536
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:26,938
We have a mirepoix.

537
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,439
You've got
 your bouquet garni

538
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,608
with your sage,
 rosemary, thyme.

539
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,777
Got it.
 -We have veal knuckle bones.

540
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:34,712
- Smeared with tomato paste?
    -Yeah.

541
00:18:34,714 --> 00:18:37,048
Now we're gonna deglaze
    with red wine.

542
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,216
Now we got the water.

543
00:18:38,218 --> 00:18:39,283
How long are we gonna
let this simmer for?

544
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:40,418
Overnight.
    And that's gonna be

545
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,786
the jus that goes
    into the sandwich.

546
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:43,788
All of this is just to make
the stock that covers the veal.

547
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,523
- Absolutely.
   -Very nice.

548
00:18:45,525 --> 00:18:46,958
So, here we have
    the veal breasts.

549
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,160
We're gonna season it first,
    salt and pepper.

550
00:18:49,162 --> 00:18:50,761
And now you want
  to sear off the breasts,

551
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:53,865
a nice golden color.

552
00:18:53,867 --> 00:18:56,300
And then, we have the mirepoix
   with the bouquet garni,

553
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:58,603
tomato paste, veal,

554
00:18:58,605 --> 00:19:00,138
red wine, and then
    we have the stock

555
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,873
that has been
   already strained out.

556
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:03,074
We'll let that braise
 for how long?

557
00:19:03,076 --> 00:19:06,410
Four hours.
    450 degrees.

558
00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:08,713
We remove the tendons,
    remove the fat,

559
00:19:08,715 --> 00:19:12,049
and we're
  gonna build the tourine.

560
00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:15,052
You and your cardboard
 wrapped in plastic.

561
00:19:15,054 --> 00:19:17,421
You stack them on top.
     The weight.

562
00:19:17,423 --> 00:19:18,823
Straight to the walk-in.

563
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:22,260
24 hours.
   So, we need a torch.

564
00:19:22,262 --> 00:19:24,929
And then, voilà.
 -Now we're speaking French.

565
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:27,665
Cut it in half, and then
   slice it into patties.

566
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:28,933
Look at that.

567
00:19:28,935 --> 00:19:31,002
Looks like pulled pork.
Little salt and pepper.

568
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:32,503
Now it's gonna
  go straight on a plancha.

569
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:35,740
Okay.
Make it happen, baby.

570
00:19:35,742 --> 00:19:37,008
Here with the brioche.
    Horseradish cream.

571
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:39,510
Then, we have veal jus.
    Havarti cheese.

572
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:40,645
Roasted
    green bell pepper.

573
00:19:40,647 --> 00:19:41,779
Straight
    to the salamander.

574
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:44,982
- Whoa!
   -Coming in hot!

575
00:19:44,984 --> 00:19:47,185
Place it into the board.

576
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:48,619
Along with some hard chips,

577
00:19:48,621 --> 00:19:50,721
and here we have
   the pepita sandwich.

578
00:19:53,726 --> 00:19:56,460
That has the richness of,
like, a prime rib sandwich.

579
00:19:56,462 --> 00:19:58,996
Big, rich flavor
coming from that jus.

580
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:00,898
The creaminess of the cheese
really comes through.

581
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,166
It's delicious.

582
00:20:02,168 --> 00:20:03,868
Actually, my favorite aspect
 of the entire thing

583
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,203
is the roasted
 green bell pepper,

584
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:06,404
and I don't know why
  'cause

585
00:20:06,406 --> 00:20:08,139
I'm not a huge
green bell pepper fan.

586
00:20:08,141 --> 00:20:09,941
So, that pepper goes
    into the oil

587
00:20:09,943 --> 00:20:11,943
that's been sous-vide
    with aromatics.

588
00:20:11,945 --> 00:20:14,478
Okay, so it's not your average
 green bell pepper.

589
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,147
It's great, buddy.

590
00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:19,717
It's delicious. A great
 combination of, like, flavors.

591
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:21,886
My buddy, country-singer
    James Otto here.

592
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:23,287
So, let's talk about this.

593
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:25,489
All I can say is that my mouth
is really happy right now.

594
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:27,792
I haven't been to
 Barcelona, but I'd love to go,

595
00:20:27,794 --> 00:20:29,327
and this is as close
   as I can get.

596
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:32,330
You love food
 and what you do.

597
00:20:32,332 --> 00:20:33,931
You can feel it
when you walk into this place.

598
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:35,633
I mean, it is evident.
 Congratulations.

599
00:20:35,635 --> 00:20:37,635
Thank you.

600
00:20:37,637 --> 00:20:39,570
So, that's it for this trip,
  but don't worry.

601
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:42,673
There's plenty more "Triple D"
 joints all over the country.

602
00:20:42,675 --> 00:20:44,141
I'll be looking
  for you next week

603
00:20:44,143 --> 00:20:46,244
on "Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives."

604
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:50,414
So, remember, one thing
we tell you is you...

605
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:51,515
Do not peel an octopus.

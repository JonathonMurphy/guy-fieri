1
00:00:01,669 --> 00:00:02,735
I'm Guy Fieri,
  and we're rollin' out

2
00:00:02,737 --> 00:00:03,702
for a special edition
   of "Triple D"

3
00:00:03,704 --> 00:00:05,170
in Barcelona, Spain.

4
00:00:05,172 --> 00:00:07,272
That's right. I've cruised
  on over to Europe...

5
00:00:07,274 --> 00:00:08,107
Ha!

6
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:09,975
...to get a sampling of Spain...

7
00:00:09,977 --> 00:00:11,110
When in Barcelona...

8
00:00:11,112 --> 00:00:13,145
...which means all kinds
  of killer cuisine...

9
00:00:13,147 --> 00:00:14,413
Elegant.

10
00:00:14,415 --> 00:00:16,115
...from top-notch tapas...

11
00:00:16,117 --> 00:00:17,649
Cho, cho, cho, cho,
    and then

12
00:00:17,651 --> 00:00:20,119
...to some crazy
  Catalan creations...

13
00:00:20,121 --> 00:00:22,821
A little freaky at first,
   but well worth trying.

14
00:00:22,823 --> 00:00:24,690
...and on-point paella...

15
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:26,225
Mmm.
    It's delicious.

16
00:00:26,227 --> 00:00:28,794
...both traditional
   and unexpected.

17
00:00:28,796 --> 00:00:30,195
Wow! I've never
    heard of that.

18
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:31,730
So hop on board...

19
00:00:31,732 --> 00:00:32,864
Make you want to dance.

20
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:35,467
...this first-class flight
   to Flavortown.

21
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:36,702
I don't like it.
     I love it.

22
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:38,737
That's all right here,
   right now,

23
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:41,006
on "Triple D"
  in Barcelona, Spain.

24
00:00:54,688 --> 00:00:57,289
So this area is known
   as Barceloneta.

25
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:59,024
And that means
  little Barcelona.

26
00:00:59,026 --> 00:01:01,160
Now, believe it or not,
   before 1992,

27
00:01:01,162 --> 00:01:02,394
none of this was here.

28
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:03,729
I mean, there wasn't
   even a beach.

29
00:01:03,731 --> 00:01:05,230
It's a good thing
  they built it out,

30
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:07,132
otherwise you wouldn't
 get a chance to check out

31
00:01:07,134 --> 00:01:09,501
this little rockin' tapas
  and paella joint.

32
00:01:09,503 --> 00:01:11,203
This is El Pacífico.

33
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:17,709
This restaurant is, uh,
   one of my favorites.

34
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:22,147
Everything is good here.
    It's really tasty.

35
00:01:24,018 --> 00:01:25,617
But not much was
  happening around here

36
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:28,420
before the 1992 Summer Games.

37
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:31,290
So this wasn't a real area?

38
00:01:31,292 --> 00:01:34,893
You're right. It was an --
a fisherman neighborhood.

39
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:36,862
No beach, they brought
    the sand here.

40
00:01:36,864 --> 00:01:37,996
No hotels,
 no big buildings...

41
00:01:37,998 --> 00:01:38,664
No hotels?

42
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:40,065
So now it's very famous.

43
00:01:40,067 --> 00:01:40,933
Yes.

44
00:01:40,935 --> 00:01:42,267
But back in --
    before '92...

45
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:43,135
Nobody knows.

46
00:01:43,137 --> 00:01:44,470
That's crazy.

47
00:01:44,472 --> 00:01:46,638
Now, tourists, transplants,
   and locals

48
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,441
head down to the water
 for Chef Ramiro Rodriguez's

49
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:50,776
Spanish dishes.

50
00:01:50,778 --> 00:01:52,377
Paella, surf and turf?

51
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:54,613
The Surf and Turf Paella
  is one of the famous

52
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:56,849
and classics about
  this restaurant.

53
00:01:56,851 --> 00:01:58,150
What are we gonna make?

54
00:01:58,152 --> 00:01:59,518
The base for our paella.

55
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,352
Here we go.

56
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:01,887
We put some oil...
      Oil.

57
00:02:01,889 --> 00:02:05,924
Garlic, onions, green pepper,
 and red peppers.

58
00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:06,959
A few minutes.

59
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:08,160
This is calamari.

60
00:02:08,162 --> 00:02:09,061
Cuttlefish.

61
00:02:09,063 --> 00:02:10,429
Cuttlefish?
  Yes.

62
00:02:10,431 --> 00:02:13,098
I think cuttlefish is more tasty
 than calamari.

63
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,600
Okay. Great. Tomatoes?

64
00:02:14,602 --> 00:02:17,336
Tomatoes, salt,
white pepper, paprika.

65
00:02:17,338 --> 00:02:18,203
Paprika.

66
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:20,071
Smoked, red pepper paste.

67
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:21,073
Bay leaf.

68
00:02:21,075 --> 00:02:22,441
And how long is
    this going to cook?

69
00:02:22,443 --> 00:02:23,675
40 minutes to an hour.

70
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:25,344
40 minutes to an hour,
     okay.

71
00:02:25,346 --> 00:02:26,512
Yes.

72
00:02:26,514 --> 00:02:28,013
Okay. So we got fresh chicken
     and rabbit.

73
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:30,115
I love rabbit.
   This is local chicken.

74
00:02:30,117 --> 00:02:31,150
<i> Loco</i> chicken?

75
00:02:31,152 --> 00:02:33,185
Not<i> loco</i> chicken,
     local.

76
00:02:33,187 --> 00:02:34,153
Ah, close to here?

77
00:02:34,155 --> 00:02:35,053
Yeah.

78
00:02:35,055 --> 00:02:37,122
Yes. Yes,
it is close to here.

79
00:02:37,124 --> 00:02:39,725
Is rabbit very popular
    in Spanish cooking?

80
00:02:39,727 --> 00:02:40,659
It is.

81
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:42,294
Super lean.
    Salt and pepper.

82
00:02:42,296 --> 00:02:43,495
Salt, pepper, oil.

83
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:44,163
Sear?

84
00:02:44,165 --> 00:02:45,264
And to the oven.

85
00:02:45,266 --> 00:02:46,331
Oh, in the oven.
   We're gonna roast it?

86
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,499
Yeah.
      Got it.

87
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,268
All right. So we have
    our roasted chicken

88
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,469
and our roasted<i> conejo.</i>

89
00:02:50,471 --> 00:02:51,904
Yes.
In the paella pan --

90
00:02:51,906 --> 00:02:54,006
garlic, parsley, and oil.

91
00:02:54,008 --> 00:02:55,507
Okay.
 Our base.

92
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,309
So you've got the cuttlefish,
    the peppers,

93
00:02:57,311 --> 00:02:58,777
the onions,
   the garlic, the spices.

94
00:02:58,779 --> 00:02:59,611
Okay.
  Yes.

95
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:00,479
And what type of rice?

96
00:03:00,481 --> 00:03:01,313
Bomba rice.
    Bomba rice, huh?

97
00:03:01,315 --> 00:03:02,314
Yes. We use bomba rice.

98
00:03:02,316 --> 00:03:03,515
Yeah. You know,
you know about this.

99
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:05,651
Bomba is from Valencia,
 close to here.

100
00:03:05,653 --> 00:03:06,852
A region that's close
    to here? Okay.

101
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:09,121
Yeah. And the rice
is very good in Valencia.

102
00:03:09,123 --> 00:03:11,256
Okay. A little of
   the beautiful saffron.

103
00:03:11,258 --> 00:03:12,391
Yes. And then...

104
00:03:12,393 --> 00:03:14,059
Stock, chicken and rabbit?

105
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:14,993
Yes.

106
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:16,161
We continue
   to let it cook here?

107
00:03:16,163 --> 00:03:17,329
Yes, 10 minutes.

108
00:03:17,331 --> 00:03:18,630
Look at these, huh?

109
00:03:18,632 --> 00:03:20,465
Fresh as fresh can be.

110
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:22,067
We add the seafood.

111
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:25,003
The shrimp,
   the mussels, the clams.

112
00:03:25,005 --> 00:03:26,205
And it goes to the oven.

113
00:03:26,207 --> 00:03:28,040
For another 7, 8 minutes?

114
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:28,707
Yeah.

115
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:29,374
Okay.

116
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:30,809
Paella is ready.

117
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:33,212
We finish with some
 fresh parsley.

118
00:03:33,214 --> 00:03:35,581
Wow. But look at that
     bomba rice.

119
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:36,915
Look at that.

120
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:40,552
Can you see the steam
  comin' off of that thing?

121
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,020
Mm.

122
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:43,355
The cuttlefish
    is super tender,

123
00:03:43,357 --> 00:03:45,156
I mean, melt-in-your-mouth
     tender.

124
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:47,125
And the shrimp is local?

125
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:47,793
Yes.

126
00:03:47,795 --> 00:03:49,695
Mmm. It's delicious.

127
00:03:49,697 --> 00:03:51,029
The bomba rice
     is perfect.

128
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:52,698
It's nice.
   It's really firm rice,

129
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,733
a real bounty
    with the rabbit,

130
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:58,070
the shrimp, the clams,
  the mussels, the chicken.

131
00:03:58,072 --> 00:04:00,639
Made with a lot of care,
    not overseasoned,

132
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:03,442
but it's the creamy,
    tender cuttlefish

133
00:04:03,444 --> 00:04:05,410
at the bottom of it
    and the depth

134
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:07,879
of the flavor of the sauce,
  it's not just fish stock.

135
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:09,648
Oh, excellent.

136
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,483
Thank you.

137
00:04:11,485 --> 00:04:13,552
Great paella,
  it's all very tender.

138
00:04:13,554 --> 00:04:17,289
And the rice is very moist,
 not a dry bite. I love it.

139
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:20,025
I think it's nice to have
the meat and fish together.

140
00:04:20,027 --> 00:04:21,293
It's absolutely delicious.

141
00:04:21,295 --> 00:04:23,161
And served up in
  a pretty sweet setting.

142
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:25,731
It's beautiful.
 People are playing volleyball,

143
00:04:25,733 --> 00:04:28,100
the sports club
 where all the boats are.

144
00:04:28,102 --> 00:04:29,835
Which means the crowds
   will be here

145
00:04:29,837 --> 00:04:31,003
no matter what they're servin'.

146
00:04:31,005 --> 00:04:33,338
I thought seaside was,
    like, sandwiches

147
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,873
and little poquito tapas.

148
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:35,641
Not here.

149
00:04:35,643 --> 00:04:36,975
Elegant.

150
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:39,244
El Pacífico,
   with the finger, huh?

151
00:04:39,246 --> 00:04:41,179
With the finger?
 Yes, El Pacífico.

152
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,616
Yeah. Here,
 they're not taking shortcuts

153
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:45,884
with their hearty menu.

154
00:04:45,886 --> 00:04:47,252
Arroz negro paella.

155
00:04:47,254 --> 00:04:49,655
Black rice,
 it's a typical Spanish food.

156
00:04:49,657 --> 00:04:54,426
My favorite kind of paella,
 but it's, like, delicious.

157
00:04:54,428 --> 00:04:56,395
Black rice
    with squid ink?

158
00:04:56,397 --> 00:04:57,729
Yes.
      Okay.

159
00:04:57,731 --> 00:04:59,231
So a little bit
    of the olive oil

160
00:04:59,233 --> 00:05:01,266
with the parsley
    and the garlic,

161
00:05:01,268 --> 00:05:04,303
some of the cuttlefish base
 that we made with the peppers

162
00:05:04,305 --> 00:05:07,139
and the onions and the garlic
    and the tomatoes,

163
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:10,742
the bomba and black rice
    is traditional?

164
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:12,044
Yes.
     Now what?

165
00:05:12,046 --> 00:05:13,512
Squid ink...

166
00:05:13,514 --> 00:05:15,147
The shrimps.

167
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:16,148
So we add the fish stock.

168
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,182
Yes.

169
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:18,617
So we let this go
    for 10 minutes?

170
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:20,118
And then the clams.

171
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,621
All right.

172
00:05:22,623 --> 00:05:23,989
Black rice.

173
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:26,358
Do most people, Chef, when they
   would first see this,

174
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,726
they would think
    somebody burned it.

175
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:28,894
Yes.

176
00:05:28,896 --> 00:05:29,761
And what is that?

177
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:30,629
Aioli.

178
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:31,496
Aioli.

179
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:36,234
Yes.

180
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:37,703
It tastes so much
     different.

181
00:05:37,705 --> 00:05:39,104
Yes. The ink.

182
00:05:39,106 --> 00:05:40,939
It's the ink you think?

183
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:42,507
What do you think?

184
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:45,944
It's takin' me to the brink.

185
00:05:45,946 --> 00:05:48,347
Did I just blink?
     It's crazy.

186
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:49,715
You think it's
   the ink though, really?

187
00:05:49,717 --> 00:05:51,450
The ink doesn't have
    a lot of flavor.

188
00:05:51,452 --> 00:05:53,418
Well, yes, it's so salty.

189
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,087
Maybe it is the salt level
     that's --

190
00:05:55,089 --> 00:05:56,555
that's coming up
    a little bit on it.

191
00:05:56,557 --> 00:05:57,556
Yes. Yes.

192
00:05:57,558 --> 00:05:58,623
And what do I do with
     the aioli?

193
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,759
They put this and mix it.

194
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:03,161
When in Barcelona...

195
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,101
I've never heard of that,
    of taking paella

196
00:06:09,103 --> 00:06:12,070
and stirring in the, uh --
     the aioli.

197
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:13,038
Different.

198
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,239
Way different.

199
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:16,007
I mean, now the richness

200
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:19,344
and the creaminess level of it
   go through the roof.

201
00:06:19,346 --> 00:06:20,779
Wow!

202
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:22,547
You allow people that option,
   they've got to do that.

203
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:23,482
Yes.

204
00:06:23,484 --> 00:06:25,851
You're fanta--
    This guy, huh?

205
00:06:25,853 --> 00:06:28,286
The first time, when
 I looked, I did not like.

206
00:06:28,288 --> 00:06:30,922
But really, when I eat,
  I -- I like so much.

207
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:33,325
The flavor is really tasty.

208
00:06:33,327 --> 00:06:35,494
And the seafood
  is really fresh.

209
00:06:35,496 --> 00:06:37,696
Very nice place,
  tastes real authentic.

210
00:06:37,698 --> 00:06:39,598
It's amazing.
   I love it.

211
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,299
This is awesome.
   This is what I wanted.

212
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:42,100
Thank you.

213
00:06:42,102 --> 00:06:43,635
The man, good job, Chef.

214
00:06:43,637 --> 00:06:44,603
Thank you.

215
00:06:44,605 --> 00:06:46,071
Thank you.

216
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:48,940
Up next, we're diggin'
 into real-deal home cooking...

217
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:50,142
Trust me, order
    a second plate.

218
00:06:50,144 --> 00:06:51,743
...where their Spanish
   specialty...

219
00:06:53,447 --> 00:06:55,380
...isn't exactly
  what I had in mind.

220
00:06:55,382 --> 00:06:57,649
Once you get over the idea,
  the flavor is fantastic.

221
00:07:08,429 --> 00:07:11,096
So I'm here in
 the Sant Antoni neighborhood,

222
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:13,165
which, believe it or not,
 is right across the street

223
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:14,966
from the famous --
  and I mean famous,

224
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:16,067
Sant Antoni market.

225
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:17,402
You can get fruits
   and vegetable,

226
00:07:17,404 --> 00:07:18,737
stuff for the house,
   you name it.

227
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:20,639
So after a long day of shopping,
  you're thinking,

228
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:21,973
"Hmm, what would
  I like to have?"

229
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:23,341
Oh, yeah, how about
 a restaurant that serves up

230
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:24,943
traditional Catalan dishes?

231
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:27,612
This is Can Vilaró.

232
00:07:31,385 --> 00:07:35,887
This is one of the typical
 authentic places in Barcelona.

233
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:37,622
It's something you can't get
  in the United States

234
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:38,957
so, uh, it's a really
  great experience

235
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,425
to come here
 and try the different food.

236
00:07:40,427 --> 00:07:43,328
It's something that they have
 been doing, like, forever.

237
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,130
Or at least
   since the '60s.

238
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:46,865
That's when
  Siscu Vilaró's parents

239
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:48,500
first took over this joint.

240
00:07:48,502 --> 00:07:50,302
Now he works alongside
   his daughters,

241
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:53,538
Alba, Ida, and Anna,
 who's running the kitchen.

242
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,272
Three daughters?

243
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:55,040
Yeah.

244
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:57,776
So your grandfather
  was a chef.

245
00:07:57,778 --> 00:07:58,677
Now, is your father a chef?

246
00:07:58,679 --> 00:07:59,611
Yes.
    Yes.

247
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:00,645
But now you take over?

248
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:01,947
Yes. Exactly.

249
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:03,748
And she stayed true
  to the old world,

250
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:07,185
Catalan cuisine that's native
  to this part of Spain.

251
00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:10,789
It's, uh, food that you need
  a lot of time to make it.

252
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:12,424
So slow-cooking process.

253
00:08:12,426 --> 00:08:13,525
- Yeah.
   -Mm-hmm.

254
00:08:13,527 --> 00:08:15,560
Food that your grandmother
   used to do.

255
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,934
Cap i Pota.

256
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:26,671
It's the head of the cow.
 And it's cooked with the leg.

257
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:29,007
It's a very traditional
   dish here in Catalonia.

258
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,142
Cap i Pota,
 so a head and leg.

259
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:32,777
But we don't actually
 put the leg in it.

260
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:34,779
So we're gonna chop up
 some head. Awesome.

261
00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:36,748
A country like Spain,

262
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,683
and you gotta think about
how many hundreds of years,

263
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:39,851
thousands of years...

264
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:42,020
You had a cow, you had
to use the whole thing.

265
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:43,321
Well, this is
the perfect example.

266
00:08:43,323 --> 00:08:46,091
You get to the end of it.
You take the cabeza, the head,

267
00:08:46,093 --> 00:08:47,726
slow cook it.
 And there you go.

268
00:08:47,728 --> 00:08:48,960
Okay.

269
00:08:50,564 --> 00:08:51,363
The oil.

270
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:54,366
Onion, peppers...

271
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:55,033
Five minutes?

272
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:55,700
<i> Sí.</i>

273
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,236
<i> Mas o menos.</i>

274
00:08:58,238 --> 00:08:58,904
Next?

275
00:08:58,906 --> 00:08:59,938
And sofrito.

276
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,407
Sofrito of the peppers
 and the onions?

277
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:06,811
<i> Cabeza.</i>

278
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:08,647
<i> La cabeza.</i>

279
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:09,381
A little paprika?

280
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:10,582
<i> Sí.</i> And garlic.

281
00:09:10,584 --> 00:09:11,483
Garlic. Okay.

282
00:09:11,485 --> 00:09:12,284
And that's all.

283
00:09:12,286 --> 00:09:13,318
That's it? How long?

284
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,819
<i> Treinta minutos.</i>

285
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:16,154
30 minutes, okay.
      <i> Sí.</i>

286
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:18,223
It's time to face-a
  the<i> cabeza.</i>

287
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:20,091
Cap i Pota.

288
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:21,860
Hmm.

289
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,197
Where's Andrew Zimmern
    when you need him?

290
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:27,132
Mmm.

291
00:09:27,134 --> 00:09:28,400
Once you get
    over the idea,

292
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:29,834
the flavor is fantastic.

293
00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:31,202
That fat has cooked down

294
00:09:31,204 --> 00:09:33,772
to be nice
   and creamy and tender.

295
00:09:33,774 --> 00:09:35,407
I mean,
   the sauce is spot-on.

296
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:37,509
You want to have a --
   a cultural experience

297
00:09:37,511 --> 00:09:39,811
that is a real Catalan dish,
    this is it, right?

298
00:09:39,813 --> 00:09:42,013
<i> Sí.</i>

299
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:46,051
A little freaky at first,
   but well worth tryin'.

300
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:47,018
<i> Guapa.</i>

301
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:47,786
<i> Gracias.</i>
<i> De nada.</i>

302
00:09:47,788 --> 00:09:49,521
It's a fulfilling dish,

303
00:09:49,523 --> 00:09:51,690
very intense flavor.

304
00:09:51,692 --> 00:09:53,959
I love it.
  It tastes like heaven.

305
00:09:53,961 --> 00:09:55,026
Were you raised
 eating this?

306
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:56,061
Oh, yeah, of course.

307
00:09:56,063 --> 00:09:57,762
It's hard to find places
   like this one.

308
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,831
You can come to Barcelona
 and get great food.

309
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:02,133
But to find the
Catalan style menu...

310
00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:04,202
Nowadays,
  it's not so common.

311
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:06,271
I think it would be really nice

312
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:07,906
to have more places like this

313
00:10:07,908 --> 00:10:10,275
where you can find
  the homemade meatballs.

314
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:12,410
They're amazing.
Feels like a comfort food.

315
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:14,012
Now we're gonna
    make the meatballs?

316
00:10:14,014 --> 00:10:14,679
Yes.

317
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:15,880
Pork and...

318
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:16,581
Cow.
      Okay.

319
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:17,515
Bread with...

320
00:10:18,585 --> 00:10:20,585
Taking the bread with
  a little bit of the milk.

321
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:22,787
Oh, hang on,
    hang on, hang on.

322
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:25,123
Look at the color of the eggs.
   That's, like, orange.

323
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,091
Do you think about
    what they're fed

324
00:10:26,093 --> 00:10:27,626
to create that
    beautiful color?

325
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:28,393
Beautiful.

326
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:31,129
Mix.
      Okay.

327
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:32,764
In Spanish --<i> Mézclelo.</i>

328
00:10:32,766 --> 00:10:34,399
Mix --<i> Mézclelo.</i>

329
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:36,868
I got the words.

330
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,536
Okay. So in the flour,

331
00:10:38,538 --> 00:10:40,872
in the pan,
   and then we fry 'em,

332
00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:43,708
Little oil? Got it.

333
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,243
Okay.

334
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:47,445
And this is the<i> salsa</i>
 for the meatballs?

335
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:48,146
<i> Sí.</i>

336
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,014
Okay. First...

337
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:50,749
Vegetable broth.

338
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:52,917
Tomato sauce?

339
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:53,585
Onions.

340
00:10:53,587 --> 00:10:54,386
Some fried onions.

341
00:10:54,388 --> 00:10:55,654
<i> Sí.</i>

342
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:56,554
<i> Media hora.</i>

343
00:10:56,556 --> 00:10:57,522
So half an hour?

344
00:10:57,524 --> 00:10:58,223
Yeah.

345
00:10:58,225 --> 00:10:59,557
Half an hour.

346
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:01,326
Got that<i> media hora.</i>

347
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:02,827
And then the peas.

348
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:05,797
Mushrooms?
And then the fried meatballs?

349
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:07,332
<i> Sí.</i>

350
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:15,073
Nuts and garlic.

351
00:11:15,075 --> 00:11:16,207
No.

352
00:11:16,777 --> 00:11:18,643
Ah, see, I was trying
     to help!

353
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:20,712
I was right in there
  for you with the coverage.

354
00:11:20,714 --> 00:11:21,746
Where is it going?
     In here?

355
00:11:21,748 --> 00:11:22,414
Yes.

356
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:23,915
<i> Un poco.</i>

357
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:24,949
A little bit.

358
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:26,317
And then let 'em
sit there and simmer

359
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:27,485
inside of that sauce.

360
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:28,186
10 minutes.

361
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,988
Okay.

362
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:36,628
They're as good
 as any meatballs you'll find

363
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:39,364
on the streets in --
     in Italy.

364
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:41,433
The gravy is ridiculous.
    I mean, the sauce,

365
00:11:41,435 --> 00:11:43,268
you're just begging for some
  bread to sop it up there.

366
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,836
Actually I want
    all these meatballs

367
00:11:44,838 --> 00:11:46,938
just on one
    big hoagie roll.

368
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:48,273
Uh-huh.

369
00:11:48,275 --> 00:11:49,074
Catalonia.

370
00:11:49,076 --> 00:11:50,208
Catalan porron.

371
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,343
This is actually
  called a porron,

372
00:11:52,345 --> 00:11:54,746
or a traditional
  Spanish wine pitcher.

373
00:11:54,748 --> 00:11:56,748
Okay.
   I'll take this, too.

374
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,249
I'm gonna wear
    some of this.

375
00:11:58,251 --> 00:12:00,251
Oh!

376
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:04,489
Oh, there's
    booze in that.

377
00:12:04,491 --> 00:12:05,690
I didn't know there was
    gonna be booze.

378
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:06,958
I thought it was
    apple juice.

379
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,428
Fantastic.

380
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,764
- Do you like it?
 -I don't like it. I love it.

381
00:12:12,766 --> 00:12:15,834
Tender, lots of flavor,
     juicy.

382
00:12:15,836 --> 00:12:18,036
It's interesting 'cause
    this Catalan style

383
00:12:18,038 --> 00:12:19,537
doesn't have any
    of the flavors

384
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:22,140
that are reminiscent of what
  I think of Spanish food.

385
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:25,210
No real heavy spice,
     fantastic.

386
00:12:25,212 --> 00:12:26,911
Trust me, order
    a second plate.

387
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:29,080
- Meatballs.
  -They're super soft.

388
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,915
They melt in your mouth.
  I love the flavor.

389
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:32,283
This is awesome.

390
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:34,252
All right. So have you guys
  been to Barcelona before?

391
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,320
- No.
 -No. This is our first time.

392
00:12:35,322 --> 00:12:36,721
And how many kids
    do you guys have?

393
00:12:36,723 --> 00:12:37,388
- Four.
    -Four.

394
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,323
Say hi to 'em.

395
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:39,824
- Hey!
 -Hi, Jackie, hi, Michael,

396
00:12:39,826 --> 00:12:41,326
- Antoine and Anthony.
  -Antoine, Anthony.

397
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:43,128
Nothing makes
  their kids happier than,

398
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:45,130
A, their parents going
  on vacation without them,

399
00:12:45,132 --> 00:12:47,098
and, B, that they
     get on TV.

400
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,266
So would you send
     folks here?

401
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:49,300
Yes, sir.
   Absolutely.

402
00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:50,368
I would.

403
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,736
Want to try traditional
  Catalonian food,

404
00:12:51,738 --> 00:12:53,438
then this is the place
  to visit for sure.

405
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,406
You see a big menu,
    I mean, it's great.

406
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:57,942
This guy
    and his daughters.

407
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:01,880
Coming up...

408
00:13:04,084 --> 00:13:05,617
We're headed
  to what looks like

409
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:07,051
just your everyday bar...

410
00:13:07,053 --> 00:13:09,320
Kind of a small kitchen for
  the guy with a crazy flame.

411
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:11,456
But it's hiding atop
  this treasure trove.

412
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,091
I'm not kiddin' you. It's
 exactly what I was looking for.

413
00:13:15,362 --> 00:13:17,395
Oh! Ah!

414
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:19,364
Oh! Ooh!

415
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:22,634
She stole my bit!

416
00:13:28,175 --> 00:13:30,975
So I'm here in an area known
  as L'Eixample Gràcia,

417
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:33,711
which is basically dead center
   of Barcelona.

418
00:13:33,713 --> 00:13:34,779
And I know you've heard me

419
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:36,181
say it a million times
   on "Triple D,"

420
00:13:36,183 --> 00:13:38,183
but when you're going through
 an intersection like this,

421
00:13:38,185 --> 00:13:40,118
slow down, take a look around,

422
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,420
or you might blow by
  this nondescript bar

423
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:45,824
that just happens to be
 hiding a righteous tapas place.

424
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:47,725
This is Bar Morryssom.

425
00:13:54,768 --> 00:13:56,768
Just what you want
  from a tapas place.

426
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:57,936
<i> Codornices</i>
 <i> a la vinagreta.</i>

427
00:13:57,938 --> 00:13:59,304
This is a good
  neighborhood place.

428
00:13:59,306 --> 00:14:01,072
It's been here for
 I don't know how many years.

429
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:03,641
We'll just ask owner
   Pedro Sausor.

430
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:04,976
How long has he had
  the restaurant here?

431
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:08,713
45 years.

432
00:14:08,715 --> 00:14:09,614
Really?

433
00:14:09,616 --> 00:14:11,316
<i> Sí.</i>
He started when he was 20.

434
00:14:11,318 --> 00:14:13,218
As the chef
  for a previous owner

435
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,587
who met his wife, Alba,
 who worked here as well.

436
00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:18,957
And together they took it
  over back in the '70s.

437
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,926
And four decades later,
 they run it with their sons

438
00:14:21,928 --> 00:14:24,329
plus daughter-in-law,
  Carolyn Bradford,

439
00:14:24,331 --> 00:14:27,098
who just adds
 to Pedro's family flavor.

440
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,499
The food is always delicious.

441
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:30,134
They make a really
  wide range of dishes,

442
00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:31,536
Which completely
   run the gamut.

443
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:33,771
From Mediterranean
   seafood staples

444
00:14:33,773 --> 00:14:35,640
to tapas like classic croquettes

445
00:14:35,642 --> 00:14:37,742
to true Spanish specialties.

446
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:43,181
Quails with
 el vinagreta.

447
00:14:43,183 --> 00:14:45,049
We're in this little bar,
 we're gonna have some quails.

448
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:45,950
<i> Sí. Sí.</i>
Yeah.

449
00:14:49,656 --> 00:14:50,922
Really tender,
  fall off the bone.

450
00:14:50,924 --> 00:14:53,458
They really just do it
  exactly the right way.

451
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:58,229
Before we start to do
 the codorniz,

452
00:14:58,231 --> 00:14:59,530
we have to make
 the egg dance.

453
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:00,899
See, I don't know what
  that means. But, you ready?

454
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,273
I have been cooking
    all my life.

455
00:15:08,275 --> 00:15:10,842
I know every dumb kitchen
   trick that there is.

456
00:15:10,844 --> 00:15:13,678
That one right there takes
  the cake. That was awesome.

457
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:15,480
Let's start.
 Let's start.

458
00:15:15,482 --> 00:15:16,581
I got to have a trick now.

459
00:15:17,884 --> 00:15:19,350
Okay.

460
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:20,585
The onions.

461
00:15:24,658 --> 00:15:28,259
In<i> inglés,</i> it's "bay leaf."

462
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:30,762
I listen to him talk, I mean,
 I don't even need a translator.

463
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:31,729
I just listen to him talk.

464
00:15:32,465 --> 00:15:33,631
Okay. What is this?

465
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:35,366
The broom that you
    sweep the floor?

466
00:15:35,368 --> 00:15:36,401
<i> Es escoba.</i>

467
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:40,471
- What is it?
    -Thyme.

468
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:42,707
Thyme?
  That's some funky thyme.

469
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:44,309
Pepper.

470
00:15:44,311 --> 00:15:46,177
Cloves?

471
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:47,779
Now we'll take the quails.

472
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:51,015
Now we have to kill
 any germs with...

473
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:52,884
And these just came
   from the market today.

474
00:15:52,886 --> 00:15:55,320
<i> Sí.</i>

475
00:15:55,322 --> 00:15:58,056
Kinda a small kitchen for
  the guy with a crazy flame.

476
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,927
Now we put the quails in.

477
00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:03,928
Peep, peep, peep,
    peep.

478
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:04,729
Peep, peep, peep,
     peep?

479
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:06,998
It flew into the pot?

480
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,700
- Yeah.
  -I'm gettin' it.

481
00:16:08,702 --> 00:16:09,567
Give me a little
    more time here.

482
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:12,603
It's a little salt,
    a little pepper,

483
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:15,073
a little white wine,
  and a little red vinegar.

484
00:16:15,075 --> 00:16:16,808
This was a granny's recipe.

485
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,276
It's, like, 100 years
 old he said.

486
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:18,943
I love it.

487
00:16:18,945 --> 00:16:19,610
Years ago they'd make it

488
00:16:19,612 --> 00:16:20,611
and they'd store it

489
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:22,046
for two months
 and it'd be fine.

490
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:23,982
Because of all that vinegar --
    just preserves it.

491
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:26,317
Do I have to wait two months,
or are we going to eat it today?

492
00:16:30,357 --> 00:16:31,622
All right!

493
00:16:31,624 --> 00:16:33,691
Just beautiful.

494
00:16:33,693 --> 00:16:35,893
Fresh quail, never frozen.

495
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,599
Buena.

496
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:42,867
Make you want to dance.

497
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:46,437
I mean, this is,
   again, a simple dish,

498
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:49,941
but lights out delicious.

499
00:16:49,943 --> 00:16:51,642
When you take the bite
    with the quail

500
00:16:51,644 --> 00:16:53,211
and a little bit
    of those onions,

501
00:16:53,213 --> 00:16:54,846
the vinegar and the wine
     and pepper,

502
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:56,881
and just getting into it.
     Fresh...

503
00:16:56,883 --> 00:16:57,949
<i> Fresca.</i>

504
00:16:57,951 --> 00:16:59,717
Quality...
 <i> Qualidad.</i>

505
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:00,818
And corazón...

506
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:01,619
<i> Corazón.</i>

507
00:17:01,621 --> 00:17:04,455
...makes a fantastic dish.

508
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:05,923
Quail a la vinagreta.

509
00:17:05,925 --> 00:17:07,992
This is fantastic.
 I couldn't stop eating it.

510
00:17:07,994 --> 00:17:11,129
Really juicy, tasty,
  very rich, beautiful.

511
00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:15,066
How many different menu
    items does he have?

512
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:17,769
70.

513
00:17:17,771 --> 00:17:19,871
Where's
    the other kitchen?

514
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,441
Crazy.

515
00:17:23,443 --> 00:17:24,776
And there's
 one more thing about this menu

516
00:17:24,778 --> 00:17:27,311
that makes this place
  a real hidden gem.

517
00:17:27,313 --> 00:17:28,780
But it's also not
 very expensive.

518
00:17:28,782 --> 00:17:31,315
This kind of food, and they
  charge double price in

519
00:17:31,317 --> 00:17:32,016
the rest of the city.

520
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:33,051
So here's the deal --

521
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:34,719
I am traveling through
     Barcelona

522
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:36,220
checkin' out
   the greatest joints.

523
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:38,289
What I just experienced
    was dynamite.

524
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:39,991
I can only imagine
   what's comin' up next.

525
00:17:39,993 --> 00:17:42,160
See you in a little bit.

526
00:17:50,837 --> 00:17:53,104
So welcome back.
 "Triple D" in Barcelona, Spain.

527
00:17:53,106 --> 00:17:54,472
It doesn't get
   any better than that.

528
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:56,774
This is Pedro.
  And this is Bar Morryssom.

529
00:17:58,411 --> 00:17:59,610
I love eating Pedro's food.

530
00:17:59,612 --> 00:18:03,681
It's very authentic,
  very fresh, very tasty.

531
00:18:03,683 --> 00:18:05,750
Now, you walk up
    to this place,

532
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:07,285
you're gonna go,
 "Ah, it's just a little bar,

533
00:18:07,287 --> 00:18:09,153
you get a couple cocktails,
  maybe get a ham sandwich."

534
00:18:09,155 --> 00:18:10,621
Not with this dude
     in charge!

535
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:14,125
No. He's rockin'
 a huge menu of legit tapas.

536
00:18:14,127 --> 00:18:16,094
It's typical tapas
 that you have in the area

537
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:17,795
but just fantastically made.

538
00:18:17,797 --> 00:18:20,731
You can share. When you find one
 you really particularly like...

539
00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:22,133
Chickpeas with prawns.

540
00:18:22,135 --> 00:18:24,168
I absolutely adore
 the prawns and chickpeas here.

541
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:26,237
It's a really good, fresh,
  combination of, uh,

542
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:28,239
ingredients that they have
  here at Morryssom.

543
00:18:28,241 --> 00:18:30,475
All right, Chef.

544
00:18:32,378 --> 00:18:33,177
Olive oil?

545
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:35,379
Okay.

546
00:18:35,381 --> 00:18:37,415
This is called sofrito,

547
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:39,617
<i> Sofrito. Olé!</i>
<i> Olé!</i>

548
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,953
Garlic.

549
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:43,554
Cho, cho, cho, cho, cho, cho.

550
00:18:43,556 --> 00:18:44,622
Okay.

551
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:47,325
Red peppers,
 green peppers.

552
00:18:47,327 --> 00:18:48,726
Put the prawns in.

553
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:50,495
Did he put them
    on the parsley?

554
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,665
It gives a bit of
the flavor and a smell.

555
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:56,134
But that's the eye
     of a chef.

556
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:57,568
Now we'll put some salt in.

557
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:00,738
Put in the brandy.

558
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,873
Okay.<i> Listo?</i>

559
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:03,741
Hey!

560
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:04,942
If it wasn't hot enough
    in this kitchen,

561
00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:06,811
it got a little bit warmer.

562
00:19:08,414 --> 00:19:09,947
We put in the chick peas.

563
00:19:09,949 --> 00:19:11,315
From a can or dry?

564
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:12,517
He picks them himself.

565
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:13,751
All the difference
    in the world.

566
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:15,953
You can infuse flavor
   into it while it cooks.

567
00:19:15,955 --> 00:19:18,689
Oh. That just
    by itself...

568
00:19:18,691 --> 00:19:20,791
Cho, cho, cho, cho.

569
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:23,261
Cho, cho, cho, cho.

570
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,128
And then...

571
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:24,795
<i> Sí?</i>

572
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:26,631
Ha!

573
00:19:26,633 --> 00:19:28,332
So simple, all the flavor

574
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:30,101
comin' out of those
    peppers and onions.

575
00:19:30,103 --> 00:19:30,935
Mm.

576
00:19:35,475 --> 00:19:37,041
Good wine, good food,
 and then sleep.

577
00:19:37,043 --> 00:19:38,342
We like the same things.

578
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:43,247
When I think of tapas,

579
00:19:43,249 --> 00:19:44,982
this is exactly
    how I think of it.

580
00:19:44,984 --> 00:19:49,453
The chickpeas are so tender

581
00:19:49,455 --> 00:19:51,122
and take on the flavor
     so well.

582
00:19:51,124 --> 00:19:54,525
But when you put fresh shrimp,
    organic vegetables,

583
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:56,527
and treat it all
    with respect,

584
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:59,230
I mean, it's a very simple dish,
   but it is fantastic.

585
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:03,000
You have to do it -- you have
to make it with a lot of love.

586
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:05,169
He treats it like
  he's feeding his family.

587
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:07,371
So just so you know,
   I'm part of the family.

588
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:13,644
Dynamite.

589
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:15,112
Chickpeas with prawns.

590
00:20:15,114 --> 00:20:18,649
Prawn's absolutely perfect,
 you know, succulent, tasty.

591
00:20:20,186 --> 00:20:21,819
Simple ingredients,

592
00:20:21,821 --> 00:20:24,055
cooked correctly
    makes big flavor.

593
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:24,855
<i> Sí.</i>

594
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,994
The food in this place is always
  consistently excellent.

595
00:20:29,996 --> 00:20:33,197
And that's why the place is busy
  all day long every day.

596
00:20:33,199 --> 00:20:35,766
You come to Barcelona,
   you want to get tapas,

597
00:20:35,768 --> 00:20:37,335
you got to come here.
   I'm not kiddin' you.

598
00:20:37,337 --> 00:20:38,536
It's exactly what
    I was looking for.

599
00:20:38,538 --> 00:20:40,104
Fantastic.

600
00:20:40,106 --> 00:20:43,107
You'll love this guy.

601
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:44,408
That's it for this trip.

602
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,577
But don't you worry,
  there's funky joints

603
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:47,912
all over this world.

604
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:50,615
And I'll be looking for you
 next time on "Triple D."

605
00:20:50,617 --> 00:20:52,049
- Right?
   -It's clear.

606
00:20:54,454 --> 00:20:55,920
Did you just take over
     my show

607
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:57,221
and look into the camera
    and start talking?

608
00:20:57,223 --> 00:20:58,923
I love it.

609
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:00,124
I like the way he rolls.

00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,833
 but there's something about it.

900
00:31:09,835 --> 00:31:11,034
      I think, the chorizo.

901
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:12,603
                  Hoo-whee!

902
00:31:12,605 --> 00:31:14,538
    Now, you don't<i> have</i> to go
        for the garbage.

903
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,607
     Lots of folks come here
        for the omelettes

904
00:31:16,609 --> 00:31:18,442
    or the huge French toast.

905
00:31:18,444 --> 00:31:19,776
      This is all for you?!

906
00:31:19,778 --> 00:31:21,245
    I thought I'd share some
        Oh, my goodness!

00:31:21,247 --> 00:31:22,846
          with a friend
    in the back dining room.

908
00:31:22,848 --> 00:31:25,115
  Are you gonna share with me?
              -No.

909
00:31:25,117 --> 00:31:27,584
        -No? That was no?
           -[Laughter]

        Can't blame her.

911
00:31:28,821 --> 00:31:30,854
     The French toast comes
      from homemade bread.

912
00:31:30,856 --> 00:31:32,656
     You'd never expect this
     from a breakfast joint.

913
00:31:32,658 --> 00:31:34,358
              We really wanted
      to stay with the tradition

914
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,226
                of old diner,
            everything homemade,

916
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:39,396
             and homemade bread
              is part of that.

917
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:41,331
        They scratch-bake
        everything here.

918
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:43,367
           We hand me the bread.
       I had the most arm power,

919
00:31:43,369 --> 00:31:44,635
               so I got stuck
                  doing it.

920
00:31:44,637 --> 00:31:47,604
    Lemme see those heaters.
           Huh? Look!

           -All right.

923
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:52,609
       Do you know how to braid?
                He's got it.

924
00:31:52,611 --> 00:31:53,944
  No, I just wanted to redo it.

925
00:31:53,946 --> 00:31:55,445
               Make it pretty?
                    Yeah.

926
00:31:55,447 --> 00:31:57,214
     We're gonna serve this.
    I don't want you to say,

927
00:31:57,216 --> 00:31:59,816
     "Oh hey, Marge, Lloyd,
       hey, how ya' doing?

              -Hmm?
    -Hoh-hoh. I'm impressed.

    Now, where did you learn
        to make pasties?

937
00:32:22,841 --> 00:32:24,408
lower Wisconsin, upper Illinois?
         -A little bit,

938
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:26,810
         because a lot of people
                  have come

939
00:32:26,812 --> 00:32:29,179

00:39:08,246 --> 00:39:10,680
 We had the marinated flap meat
     done in the stout beer.

1150
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:11,815
    Some real-deal barbecue.

1151
00:39:11,817 --> 00:39:13,683
      But the whole reason
    I rolled into this joint

1152
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:15,919
        was I heard about
      this lobster martini.

1153
00:39:15,921 --> 00:39:18,088
              I love martinis.
              This is awesome.

1154
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:20,523
         Something I've
        never had before.

1155
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:21,624
              Two Lobstertinis!

1156
00:39:21,626 --> 00:39:23,059
 You're the one that
invented this, right?

1157
00:39:23,061 --> 00:39:24,327
   Yeah. Instead of vermouth,

1158
00:39:24,329 --> 00:39:25,862
        lobster essence,
    and you put a claw on it.

1159
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:27,364
       -And they like it?
      -Yeah, they like it.

1160
00:39:27,366 --> 00:39:28,898
               It tastes like
            the ocean -- lovely.

1161
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,633
         I wanted to get a drink
             and enjoy lobster,

1162
00:39:30,635 --> 00:39:33,236
  so you have to go with this.
    -These are the lobsters.

1163
00:39:33,238 --> 00:39:35,572
   We're gonna use the bodies
      to make the stock --

1164
00:39:35,574 --> 00:39:36,973
           the essence
      for the Lobstertini.

1165
00:39:36,975 --> 00:39:38,742
               Still a little
             funkified by this,

1166
00:39:38,744 --> 00:39:40,043
              to be very honest
                  with you.

1167
00:39:40,045 --> 00:39:41,945
        I mean, I like -- I love
          making lobster bisque.

1168
00:39:41,947 --> 00:39:43,947
           Same start,
        different finish.

1169
00:39:43,949 --> 00:39:45,849
   Do you like dirty martinis?
     -I like dirty martinis.

1170
00:39:45,851 --> 00:39:47,550
      Then, I think this is
      gonna be your segue.

1171
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:49,686
      -This is gonna do it?
       -Like salty, briny,

1172
00:39:49,688 --> 00:39:51,121
    delicious lobster flavor.
           -Lobstery?

1173
00:39:51,123 --> 00:39:52,722
       It's also a snack.

1174
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:54,457
           -All right.
     -You're gonna love it.

1175
00:39:54,459 --> 00:39:56,126
  And of course, we threw some
     of our magical salt mix

1176
00:39:56,128 --> 00:39:57,527
          in the water.
  -Of course we did, 'cause we

1177
00:39:57,529 --> 00:39:58,962
       don't do anything without
           the magical salt mix.

1178
00:39:58,964 --> 00:40:00,096
            -Nothing.
     -Let those go for about

1179
00:40:00,098 --> 00:40:01,297
        10 to 15 minutes?
      -'Til they turn red.

1180
00:40:01,299 --> 00:40:02,999
               Bring 'em out,
             let 'em cool down.

1181
00:40:03,001 --> 00:40:04,934
                 crack 'em,
               take the meat,

1182
00:40:04,936 --> 00:40:06,870
           and begin the process
             of making the broth

1183
00:40:06,872 --> 00:40:08,338
     with the lobster shell.
              -Yes.

1184
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:10,240
                 Cold water,
              we got the bodies

1185
00:40:10,242 --> 00:40:11,708
              -Yep.
    -and all their goodness.

1186
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:13,910
       Black peppercorns,
         onion, carrot,

1187
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:15,578
             celery.
       -A little mirepoix.

1188
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,747
      Fresh rosemary, fresh
          -BOTH: dill.

1189
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:19,482
       And a little sage.
           -And sage.

1190
00:40:19,484 --> 00:40:20,884
                 Simmer this
               for five hours.

1191
00:40:20,886 --> 00:40:22,519
          How are you gonna keep
        the murkiness of it out?

1192
00:40:22,521 --> 00:40:24,087
     Strain it once through
        a regular chinois

1193
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:26,189
           -Strainer.
 -then I'll run it again through

1194
00:40:26,191 --> 00:40:28,525
   like a coffee filter to get
  all that sediment out of it.

1195
00:40:28,527 --> 00:40:30,460
              So, this is just
            clear lobster broth.

1196
00:40:30,462 --> 00:40:32,128
        Mm-hmm. Strain it
     into a squeeze bottle.

1197
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:33,830
           And then, we're gonna
       make the lobster martini.

1198
00:40:33,832 --> 00:40:35,031
     Oh,<i> we're</i> not going to.

1199
00:40:35,033 --> 00:40:37,934
     I'm gonna hand you off
    to Sarah, my bar manager.

1200
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:39,936
   -Do you want me to make it?
    -Oh, go for it. I mean --

1201
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:41,471
     -Are you ready? Vodka.
         -Healthy pour.

1202
00:40:41,473 --> 00:40:42,272
              Yulp.

1203
00:40:42,274 --> 00:40:43,473
             -Yulp.
            -[Laughs]

1204
00:40:43,475 --> 00:40:44,908
        Lobster essence.

1205
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:47,644
   A little bit more than you
 would do vermouth in a martini.

1206
00:40:47,646 --> 00:40:48,745
But it's not as strong.

1207
00:40:48,747 --> 00:40:49,846
          Doesn't have
     a taste like vermouth.

1208
00:40:49,848 --> 00:40:50,880
     Then you just shake it.

1209
00:40:50,882 --> 00:40:51,981
  Anybody feel like
    I'm gonna be

1210
00:40:51,983 --> 00:40:55,952
    having cold,
lobster-bisque cocktail?

1211
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:57,587
Chilled martini glass.

1212
00:40:57,589 --> 00:41:00,390
    Strain it, lobster claw,
       the lemon twist --

1213
00:41:00,392 --> 00:41:03,092
    there's your Lobstertini.
     -Let me prepare myself.

1214
00:41:03,094 --> 00:41:04,928
Is there a way to do
 this in particular?

1215
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:06,329
         Some people put
    the lobster in the glass.

1216
00:41:06,331 --> 00:41:07,997
        Some people just
         eat the lobster

1217
00:41:07,999 --> 00:41:10,500
       and they finish it
   with a sip of the martini.

1218
00:41:10,502 --> 00:41:12,902
            -Mm-hmm.
 -Which is what I prefer to do.

1219
00:41:12,904 --> 00:41:15,572
    When in Rome.

1220
00:41:15,574 --> 00:41:17,140
        Mmm!
Great lobster flavor.

1221
00:41:17,142 --> 00:41:19,609
This is almost like the
ghost-of-lobster martini.

1222
00:41:19,611 --> 00:41:20,777
             -Yeah.
   -You don't get the lobster;

1223
00:41:20,779 --> 00:41:21,978
    you just get the flavor.
            -Exactly.

1224
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,112
    You just get
   the hint of it.

1225
00:41:23,114 --> 00:41:25,114
I understand why you serve
  the claw with it,

1226
00:41:25,116 --> 00:41:26,483
 but you know what?
 I think the people

1227
00:41:26,485 --> 00:41:28,384
that really like martinis
 and like 'em dirty,

1228
00:41:28,386 --> 00:41:30,887
that's gotta -- it's
absolutely lobster martini.

1229
00:41:30,889 --> 00:41:32,722
         It's fresh and it's got
              some lemon in it.

1230
00:41:32,724 --> 00:41:34,357
           It's good.
 -I'd definitely have it again.

1231
00:41:34,359 --> 00:41:35,959
 You never see it anywhere else.
             -Enjoy.

1232
00:41:35,961 --> 00:41:37,594
              It's a cool place
                 to come to.

1233
00:41:37,596 --> 00:41:39,762
  -The lobster mac 'n' cheese.
   -And the food is fabulous.

1234
00:41:39,764 --> 00:41:41,865
     So, that's it from the
         Lobster Shanty

1235
00:41:41,867 --> 00:41:43,900
    in Salem, Massachusetts.

1236
00:41:43,902 --> 00:41:46,369
       A lobster cocktail.
      I've always told ya:

1237
00:41:46,371 --> 00:41:48,304
  If it's funky, we'll find it.

1238
00:41:48,306 --> 00:41:51,241
      See ya' next time, on
  "Diners, Drive-Ins, & Dives."

1239
00:41:51,243 --> 00:41:53,109
               What is that?!
                  [laughs]

1240
00:41:53,111 --> 00:41:55,078
              What is that type
             of ridiculousness?

1241
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,779
               Does this go on
                all the time?

1242
00:41:56,781 --> 00:41:58,915
          [ Laughter ]

1243
00:41:58,917 --> 00:42:00,283
         That's awesome!
     -[Electricity buzzing]

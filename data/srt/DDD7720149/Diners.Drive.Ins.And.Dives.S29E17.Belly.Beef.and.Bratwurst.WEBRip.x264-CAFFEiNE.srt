1
00:00:01,635 --> 00:00:02,768
       Hey, I'm guy fieri.
    And you know what I need?

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:03,802
   I need you riding shotgun!

3
00:00:03,804 --> 00:00:05,571
  I'm on my way to flavortown.

4
00:00:05,573 --> 00:00:09,108
             This is
  "diners, drive-ins & dives."

5
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:10,442
          This trip...
              Whoa!

6
00:00:10,444 --> 00:00:11,810
 ...We're bringing the meats...

7
00:00:11,812 --> 00:00:12,845
        Where's that been
           all my day?

8
00:00:12,847 --> 00:00:14,747
        ...From bratwurst
        to pork belly...

9
00:00:14,749 --> 00:00:16,982
             That right there --
           that's the real deal.

10
00:00:16,984 --> 00:00:19,418
   ...Like at a bomb brew pub
     in washington state...

11
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:20,619
             Out of bounds, bro.

12
00:00:20,621 --> 00:00:23,155
     ...A not-your-everyday
    asian spot in atlanta...

13
00:00:23,157 --> 00:00:24,623
               So, you just do
             whatever you want.

14
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:26,792
     ...And in vancouver...
        Boom!

15
00:00:26,794 --> 00:00:28,127
     ...A throwback diner...

16
00:00:28,129 --> 00:00:29,161
     That's a game-changer.

17
00:00:29,163 --> 00:00:31,096
  ...Packing a culinary punch.

18
00:00:31,098 --> 00:00:32,898
I haven't had meatloaf like that
        in quite awhile.

19
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,367
I've never had meatloaf
like that in my life!

20
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:37,302
     That's all right here,
           right now,

21
00:00:37,304 --> 00:00:39,738
 On "diners, drive-ins & dives."

22
00:00:52,086 --> 00:00:53,285
               So, we're here
                in vancouver.

23
00:00:53,287 --> 00:00:54,987
          I'm with my buddy chad
              from nickelback.

24
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:56,355
               And we're here
              to check out a --

25
00:00:56,357 --> 00:00:57,456
    Let me do it.
    Let me do it.

26
00:00:57,458 --> 00:00:58,791
            -Do what?
        -Intro the show.

27
00:00:58,793 --> 00:01:00,659
          No, no, you don't have
   any experience in doing this.

28
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:01,727
    I got a demo.

29
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:03,062
While I was in japan,
   I shot a demo.

30
00:01:03,064 --> 00:01:04,229
      <i> You got to stop in.</i>

31
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:07,966
        <i> It's right here</i>
     <i> at my favorite spot...</i>

32
00:01:07,968 --> 00:01:09,134
                 All right,
           you can do the intro.

33
00:01:09,136 --> 00:01:10,335
                 All right!

34
00:01:10,337 --> 00:01:12,137
              Well, here we are
              in my backyard --

35
00:01:12,139 --> 00:01:14,073
                 Vancouver,
       british columbia, canada.

36
00:01:14,075 --> 00:01:15,641
         And when you're looking
                 for diners,

37
00:01:15,643 --> 00:01:17,342
              You're gonna look
      for a little authenticity.

38
00:01:17,344 --> 00:01:19,511
     You're gonna want something
               farm-to-table.

39
00:01:19,513 --> 00:01:21,213
   Now, there's some people here
       in town that are doing it

40
00:01:21,215 --> 00:01:23,515
                  So well,
   they mashed the two together,

41
00:01:23,517 --> 00:01:24,983
             And they called it
                fable diner.

42
00:01:24,985 --> 00:01:26,752
I've got job-security
       issues.

43
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:30,956
   French toast in the window.

44
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:34,760
   Fable diner is like casual
   comfort food with a punch.

45
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:35,994
Pulled-pork sandwich here.

46
00:01:35,996 --> 00:01:37,763
  This is a really cool diner.

47
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:39,498
         It harkens back
      to the good old days.

48
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,733
Which is exactly why
  ron macgillivray

49
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:42,835
        Bought the joint.

50
00:01:42,837 --> 00:01:45,037
 It has been a diner
  since like, 1920.

51
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:46,905
           It feels --
        it's got that...

52
00:01:46,907 --> 00:01:48,340
         -Authenticity.
           -Thank you.

53
00:01:48,342 --> 00:01:50,309
              See?
 That's why you write the songs.

54
00:01:50,311 --> 00:01:51,810
                  That's --
          I'm here for one word.

55
00:01:51,812 --> 00:01:53,178
But chef josef driemel

56
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,214
     Isn't going old-school
         with the menu.

57
00:01:55,216 --> 00:01:57,683
    They're doing things that
     normal diners don't do,

58
00:01:57,685 --> 00:02:00,319
   Like a roasted duck pancake
          with kimchi.

59
00:02:00,321 --> 00:02:02,387
Got a duck pancake for table 12.

60
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:03,922
    I love the duck pancake.

61
00:02:03,924 --> 00:02:05,824
It's got a kick from the kimchi.

62
00:02:05,826 --> 00:02:07,126
         It's something
   that you would never think

63
00:02:07,128 --> 00:02:08,827
   To put on top of a pancake.

64
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:10,195
            So, we're gonna make
             our pancake batter.

65
00:02:10,197 --> 00:02:11,396
        Rock 'n' roll it.

66
00:02:11,398 --> 00:02:14,466
              Flour, cornmeal,
       brown sugar, white sugar.

67
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:15,467
               Got a good mix.

68
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:17,669
            Salt, baking powder,
                baking soda.

69
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:18,804
          Baking soda.
              Next?

70
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:20,372
                We've got our
         wet ingredients here --

71
00:02:20,374 --> 00:02:23,609
            Eggs, grapeseed oil,
             honey, buttermilk.

72
00:02:23,611 --> 00:02:24,943
         So, wet and dry
            are done.

73
00:02:24,945 --> 00:02:26,245
      Bring them together.

74
00:02:26,247 --> 00:02:27,980
  Pancake will be ready to go.
     Now we go to the duck?

75
00:02:27,982 --> 00:02:29,948
                 Salt them,
         air dry them overnight.

76
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,383
         Roast this off
      how long, what temp?

77
00:02:31,385 --> 00:02:33,519
              About 77 degrees
                  celsius.

78
00:02:33,521 --> 00:02:34,553
                   Sorry.

79
00:02:34,555 --> 00:02:37,756
           Like, 185 fahrenheit?
                I don't know.

80
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:39,458
Converting on the fly.
 That's impressive.

81
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,093
          I do not know
      if that was correct.

82
00:02:41,095 --> 00:02:43,896
       -170.6 fahrenheit.
             -170.6.

83
00:02:43,898 --> 00:02:46,198
      I mean, so really low
     and slow for 12 hours.

84
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,399
       And what do we have
           after this?

85
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:49,168
                 Our kimchi.
               Napa cabbage --

86
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,236
         Let it sit in saltwater
             two to three hours.

87
00:02:51,238 --> 00:02:53,405
      Pull a little bit of
the moisture out of the cabbage,

88
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:54,907
       And then we'll make
        the kimchi base.

89
00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:56,575
                  Exactly.
                 Fish sauce.

90
00:02:56,577 --> 00:02:57,776
         Ginger, garlic.

91
00:02:57,778 --> 00:03:00,712
                White onions,
                salt, sugar...
         There we go.

92
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:02,047
               ...Gochujang...

93
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:03,615
           Oh, this is
        one of my faves.

94
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:05,217
               ...Dried korean
                chili flakes.

95
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:06,518
   You developed this recipe,
              chef?

96
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,320
                     No.
      A korean friend of mine --

97
00:03:08,322 --> 00:03:09,655
       This is his grandmother's
                   recipe.

98
00:03:09,657 --> 00:03:11,456
 Does your friend's
  grandmother know

99
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:12,925
  That you're using
     her recipe?

100
00:03:12,927 --> 00:03:15,060
      I'm not sure if she knows,
          but he knows for sure.

101
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:18,330
               Throw it on top
              of this cabbage.

102
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:20,232
            -Kaboom.
         -Sliced daikon.

103
00:03:20,234 --> 00:03:22,434
    Green onions and chives.
             -Okay.

104
00:03:22,436 --> 00:03:25,304
          We'll let this ferment
             three to five days.

105
00:03:25,306 --> 00:03:28,540
     Ducks are roasted off,
  shred those, build the dish.

106
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:29,942
         Chad's hungry.

107
00:03:29,944 --> 00:03:31,510
         -I can see it.
 -It's his first day on the job.

108
00:03:31,512 --> 00:03:33,879
             Got our pancake on.
              Nice heated duck.

109
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:35,380
            Little hoisin glaze,

110
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:37,816
         Some caramelized ginger
            and garlic in there.

111
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:40,552
           Got our pancake here.
       Just go in with the duck.

112
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:41,653
                We'll hit it
              with the kimchi,

113
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:44,022
               Japanese mayo,
                green onions.

114
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:45,090
This is getting serious.

115
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:46,458
      This is really taking
          another step.

116
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,193
                We call this
             crispy business --

117
00:03:48,195 --> 00:03:50,028
          Crispy fried shallots,
                puffed rice,

118
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,263
        And little sesame seeds.

119
00:03:51,265 --> 00:03:52,664
        Where's that been
           all my day?

120
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,800
--little cilantro.

121
00:03:54,802 --> 00:03:56,602
                There you go.

122
00:03:56,604 --> 00:03:59,671
        The key, I think,
    is going to be getting...

123
00:03:59,673 --> 00:04:00,639
 The whole shebang.

124
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:02,174
             -Whoa!
           -Coming in.

125
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,775
       How'd you do that?

126
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:05,577
That's a lot of stuff
   going on there.

127
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,713
 That's really good.
      The kimchi is spot-on.

128
00:04:07,715 --> 00:04:09,448
       The fish-sauce funk
       is coming through.

129
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,783
  The duck's got great flavor,
          good texture.

130
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:13,418
   Great scratch-made pancake.

131
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,455
      The fact that you can
   come into an everyday diner

132
00:04:16,457 --> 00:04:18,724
    And you could get that --
     that's a game-changer.

133
00:04:18,726 --> 00:04:21,593
  -Can I eat more of this now?
     -Please. Get after it.

134
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:22,961
 Roast-duck pancake
      for you.

135
00:04:22,963 --> 00:04:24,463
        -That's a go-to?
          -Absolutely.

136
00:04:24,465 --> 00:04:26,565
   Duck mixed with the kimchi --
                it's awesome.

137
00:04:26,567 --> 00:04:28,100
   And that's some
  real-deal kimchi.

138
00:04:28,102 --> 00:04:30,369
       It's just a great,
        unexpected dish.

139
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:32,371
With that little bit
 of meat on top of the pancake,

140
00:04:32,373 --> 00:04:35,007
  It can do for breakfast, and
you can also have it for dinner.

141
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:36,375
 Loaded french toast
      for you.

142
00:04:36,377 --> 00:04:38,043
  It's just a good, comfy spot.

143
00:04:38,045 --> 00:04:41,146
  They've captured the ambiance
   of that old diner to a "t."

144
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:42,447
   -How about the milkshakes?
            -Amazing.

145
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:43,882
            -Perfect.
  -Add a little booze to them.

146
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:45,150
              You can get booze
               in this place?

147
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:46,551
           -Oh, yeah.
 -You can get boozy milkshakes.

148
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:49,354
     We're gonna need to go back
      to the kitchen real quick.

149
00:04:49,356 --> 00:04:51,356
Where there's plenty more
   to dig into.

150
00:04:51,358 --> 00:04:52,691
      Saucing the meatloaf.

151
00:04:52,693 --> 00:04:53,959
   The meatloaf is excellent.

152
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:56,094
 It's way better than my mom's.

153
00:04:56,096 --> 00:04:57,462
          So, break us
         into meatloaf.

154
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:59,431
            Just gonna start off
              with our veg mix.

155
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:01,767
    Just a little grapeseed oil,
         some cremini mushrooms,

156
00:05:01,769 --> 00:05:04,536
                Carrots next,
        shallots, minced garlic.

157
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:05,937
      Sweat all the veggies
              down.

158
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:08,573
 We've got sweet smoked paprika,
           nutmeg, black pepper,

159
00:05:08,575 --> 00:05:09,941
      And just some kosher salt.

160
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:12,477
         Worcestershire, some of
   our housemade barbecue sauce.

161
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,213
         So that's the veg done.
            So, I make a panade.

162
00:05:15,215 --> 00:05:16,815
           -Very key.
             -Eggs.

163
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,383
         -Local organic?
           -Of course.

164
00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:19,584
             -Salt.
      -It's farm-to-table.

165
00:05:19,586 --> 00:05:21,119
         Farm-to-table.
        Thank you, again.

166
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:22,454
     I should have listened
         to your intro.

167
00:05:22,456 --> 00:05:23,755
              We're going over
              heavy cream now.

168
00:05:23,757 --> 00:05:25,123
        Bringing moisture
          to the game.

169
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,825
           Stale sourdough ends.

170
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:28,393
         "stale," isn't
       a real happy word.

171
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:30,495
some aged sourdough ends.

172
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:31,863
        Put this in the blender.

173
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:33,899
                 Grab 50/50
              ground-beef pork.

174
00:05:33,901 --> 00:05:37,703
       Lightly incorporate
the sweated veg with the panade.
      Ah.

175
00:05:37,705 --> 00:05:39,738
       Throw it into a bread pan
        and pop her in the oven.

176
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,839
                 Takes about
                2 1/2 hours.

177
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,774
              -At?
      -120 degrees celsius.

178
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:44,443
           Fantastic.
         5,000 degrees.

179
00:05:45,946 --> 00:05:48,180
Show me how to make this gravy,
 'cause I'm excited.

180
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:50,382
          -Butter down.
       -Onions and celery.

181
00:05:50,384 --> 00:05:52,050
             -Salt.
     -Bay leaf, peppercorn.

182
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:53,452
      Couple sprigs of rosemary.

183
00:05:53,454 --> 00:05:56,455
                   Thyme.
             Building our base.

184
00:05:56,457 --> 00:05:57,989
              -Oh!
        -Not too bad, eh?

185
00:05:57,991 --> 00:05:59,825
          -Smells good.
    -We go in with our flour.

186
00:05:59,827 --> 00:06:01,193
                 Duck stock.

187
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:03,628
              Use all the bones
          from the roasted duck.
               Ah.

188
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,597
       So, once it's cooked down
           for about 30 minutes,

189
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:07,432
              We're gonna go in
         with our sherry vinegar

190
00:06:07,434 --> 00:06:08,867
                And just some
           grainy dijon mustard.

191
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:10,535
        This is gonna be
        rockstar flavor.

192
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,671
       Cut up our meatloaf here.
     Lay it down on the flattop.

193
00:06:12,673 --> 00:06:14,239
       Get a little bit of color
                on each side.

194
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:18,110
        Gravy, smoked mushrooms,
             caramelized onion.

195
00:06:18,112 --> 00:06:20,178
             Mark our plate with
          a little carrot purée.

196
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,581
Definitely a little
 elevated diner here, buddy.

197
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:25,484
        Piping bag full of mash,
                 fresh veg.

198
00:06:25,486 --> 00:06:26,985
         Meatloaf coming in hot.

199
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:28,453
           Nice little
         caramelization.

200
00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:30,922
         -Got our gravy.
  -The secret is in the sauce.

201
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:32,391
        Buttermilk-fried onions.

202
00:06:32,393 --> 00:06:33,959
         That's kind of
       an old-school move.

203
00:06:33,961 --> 00:06:35,427
                  Little...
             Blue-cheese butter.

204
00:06:35,429 --> 00:06:37,129
            -Come on!
        -That's about it.

205
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:41,099
- Oh.

206
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:43,769
     Oh. Oh. Oh.
       Oh, oh.

207
00:06:43,771 --> 00:06:47,773
      -You didn't like it.
    -Oh, my god. That's good!

208
00:06:47,775 --> 00:06:51,777
     The meatloaf is tender,
      the mushroom gravy --

209
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:52,944
        Great complement.

210
00:06:52,946 --> 00:06:54,212
    That pickled mustard seed
    you added right there...

211
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:56,281
       -Add a little pop.
      -That's the pop, yep.

212
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:57,682
       Great fried onions.

213
00:06:57,684 --> 00:06:59,418
 And then go get a little touch
   of the blue-cheese butter.

214
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:02,487
            -Mm-hmm.
 -We are destroying this thing.

215
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:03,789
         Oh!

216
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,557
I haven't had meatloaf like that
        in quite a while.

217
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:07,692
I've never had meatloaf
like that in my life!

218
00:07:07,694 --> 00:07:09,027
            -Really?
             -Never.

219
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:10,462
           Fantastic.

220
00:07:10,464 --> 00:07:12,697
        Meatloaf for 17.
        Service, please.

221
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:14,733
      It's hearty, filling.

222
00:07:14,735 --> 00:07:17,035
    The mushroom gravy on it
        is so delicious.

223
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:18,937
    -Are you a meatloaf guy?
           -I am here.

224
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,472
 Chicken and grits for table 2.

225
00:07:20,474 --> 00:07:24,075
 It's really good comfort food,
   but done with high quality.

226
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:26,011
 You get something you wouldn't
      expect anywhere else.

227
00:07:26,013 --> 00:07:27,546
You can say a lot
  of things on the menu,

228
00:07:27,548 --> 00:07:29,047
    But it's what you deliver
          on the plate

229
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:30,282
           That makes
       all the difference,

230
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:31,983
         And, my friend,
         you delivered.

231
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:33,452
The next time I'm cruising
  through vancouver

232
00:07:33,454 --> 00:07:35,053
And I got some friends
    in the car...
                      Yeah.

233
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:36,221
  ...I'm just gonna
    let them know

234
00:07:36,223 --> 00:07:39,057
  We're stopping by
    fable diner.

235
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:41,159
              Huh?
        -See ya. Buh-bye.

236
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:42,461
       He opened the show,
        closed the show.

237
00:07:42,463 --> 00:07:43,528
             -Boom!
         -See you later.

238
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:45,263
             -Boom!
           -We're out!

239
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:50,502
Up next, an outrageous
 asian joint in atlanta...

240
00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:51,703
        Get that funk and skunk.

241
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:53,839
    ...Stacking up powerhouse
          pork belly...

242
00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:54,940
                  That was
              a great sandwich.

243
00:07:54,942 --> 00:07:57,375
        ...And firing up
     off-the-chain chicken.

244
00:07:57,377 --> 00:07:58,743
            I don't know whether
                to attack it

245
00:07:58,745 --> 00:07:59,911
        Or take a picture of it.

246
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:14,860
   You got to love america --
   home of mom-and-pop joints,

247
00:08:14,862 --> 00:08:16,328
        And that's where
       a lot of immigrants

248
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,263
         Started to work
 when they came to this country.

249
00:08:18,265 --> 00:08:19,931
      That's been going on
     for hundreds of years.

250
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:21,533
         So, here we are
      in atlanta, georgia,

251
00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:22,834
  And we have just that story.

252
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:25,970
     A young immigrant from
  south korea at the age of 14

253
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:28,273
   Comes to the united states,
        finds adversity,

254
00:08:28,275 --> 00:08:31,042
  But battles through it and is
   living the american dream.

255
00:08:31,044 --> 00:08:34,713
      This is pijiu belly.

256
00:08:34,715 --> 00:08:36,181
   Spicy dumpling and walnut.

257
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:38,717
    Pijiu belly's been one of
 our favorite spots to come to.

258
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,719
      They do a really good
          asian fusion.

259
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:42,521
        ...Udon stir fry.

260
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:43,788
      It's just different.

261
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,156
   You don't find it anywhere
      like this in atlanta.

262
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:46,892
'cause lenny and lili shou

263
00:08:46,894 --> 00:08:49,060
       Aren't your typical
        southern belles.

264
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:51,830
 Born and raised in south korea
       to chinese parents,

265
00:08:51,832 --> 00:08:54,699
     The siblings eventually
   came to school in the u.S.

266
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,101
              You're in college
                 in indiana?

267
00:08:56,103 --> 00:08:58,270
         -For one year.
 -Then your father passed away.

268
00:08:58,272 --> 00:09:00,705
I had to go make a living
at the chinese restaurant.

269
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,040
And six years later,

270
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:04,209
        He and his sister
     opened their own joint

271
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:07,279
           With a menu
    that's all over the map.

272
00:09:07,281 --> 00:09:09,414
  I have a burger,
    ramen noodle,

273
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:10,615
Whatever in between.

274
00:09:10,617 --> 00:09:13,118
               So, you just do
             whatever you want.

275
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,252
     Pork belly with kimchi.

276
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:16,121
  His pork belly is beautiful.

277
00:09:16,123 --> 00:09:17,489
 I mean, it's the sweetest meat.

278
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:19,724
And you have that nice
 peach hoisin sauce on top.

279
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:22,127
  You have korean and you have
      georgia and the south

280
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:23,728
      All in one sandwich.

281
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:24,796
          What are we gonna make
                today, chef?

282
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:26,631
Our crispy pork belly
      sandwich.

283
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:27,899
       Trim the pork belly down.

284
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,868
   Season it with
a garlic-pepper seasoning...
                    Okay.

285
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:32,370
    ...Overnight,
and then we pan sear each side

286
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:34,172
For about 10 minutes.
                 Next step?

287
00:09:34,174 --> 00:09:36,141
 We're gonna mix up
  the five spice...

288
00:09:36,143 --> 00:09:37,509
           So, you're gonna make
    your own chinese five spice?

289
00:09:37,511 --> 00:09:38,677
           -Yes, I do.
             -Okay.

290
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:41,246
Salt, dry red pepper,
szechuan peppercorn,

291
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:42,914
Star anise, and cloves.

292
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,449
And then here's your part.
   Make you work.

293
00:09:44,451 --> 00:09:46,418
      Nice talking to you, chef.
          I'll see you in a bit.

294
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:49,187
       I saw that boat coming in
               to port, buddy.

295
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:52,257
It is work, but the aroma
it give is unmatched.

296
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:53,358
                    Next?

297
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,227
Carrots, onions, celery,
 and then a daikon.

298
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:57,262
               Daikon radish?

299
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:59,097
  Just give a nice
   little coating.

300
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,699
           Half-hour show, chef.

301
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:06,471
You put the spices in
and the shochu wine.

302
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:08,239
       You put
the pork belly back.

303
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:10,041
             Cover it with foil,
        three hours in the oven,

304
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:11,876
                Bring it out,
           slice it into pieces,

305
00:10:11,878 --> 00:10:14,045
            Fry it, and serve it
        with what kind of sauce?

306
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:15,580
 Peach hoisin sauce.

307
00:10:15,582 --> 00:10:17,649
peach hoisin sauce.

308
00:10:17,651 --> 00:10:18,783
      Peaches.

309
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:21,519
Just give a little blend.
       Sugar.

310
00:10:21,521 --> 00:10:23,121
             You sure that's not
                 too sweet?

311
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:25,123
       Never.
Think it needs more sugar?

312
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,192
- No more sugar.

313
00:10:27,194 --> 00:10:28,960
     -What's the final step?
       -Easy-make kimchi.

314
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:30,195
       -Easy-make kimchi.
              -Yes.

315
00:10:30,197 --> 00:10:32,631
                 Right here
       at easy-make pijiu belly.

316
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:34,399
Napa cabbage and red miso.

317
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:35,667
               Chili son bao?

318
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:39,070
Minced garlic, ginger,
shredded daikon, carrots.

319
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:40,839
      -Korean chili flake?
         -The clay pot.

320
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:42,440
         Oh, you're gonna put it
              in the clay pot?
     Oh, yeah.

321
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:43,908
           How long are we gonna
              let this go for?

322
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,043
      One week.

323
00:10:45,045 --> 00:10:46,111
         Oh, you're really gonna
               let it ferment.

324
00:10:46,113 --> 00:10:48,079
              -Yes.
    -Get that funk and skunk.

325
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:49,581
             And now we're gonna
              build a sandwich.

326
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:52,617
Kimchi, peach hoisin sauce,
     pork belly.

327
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:55,120
        Look how tender that is.

328
00:10:55,122 --> 00:10:56,521
              That's pork belly
                 chinatown.

329
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:58,923
              That's right on.
  Peach hoisin sauce.

330
00:10:58,925 --> 00:11:00,892
              I just want this
                 by itself.

331
00:11:04,131 --> 00:11:05,263
                  That was
              a great sandwich.

332
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:07,332
      The peach sauce reminds me
               of plum sauce.

333
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:09,467
             It's not too sweet.
             The pork's tender.

334
00:11:09,469 --> 00:11:11,036
               It's unctuous.

335
00:11:11,038 --> 00:11:13,338
       I don't know how to spell
                 that word.
     Okay.

336
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:17,909
           The kimchi is bright,
               crunchy, funky.

337
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:20,412
             That right there --
           that's the real deal.

338
00:11:20,414 --> 00:11:21,413
     Pork belly with kimchi.

339
00:11:21,415 --> 00:11:23,214
    Pork belly -- oh, my god.

340
00:11:23,216 --> 00:11:25,116
 The sweet sauce sort of offset

341
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:27,352
         The robustness
       of the pork itself.

342
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:28,753
The kimchi is so good.

343
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:30,922
      It's nothing I've had
  on other burgers around town.

344
00:11:30,924 --> 00:11:32,223
    Couple of my buddies here --

345
00:11:32,225 --> 00:11:34,492
          They play professional
                table tennis.

346
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:35,994
      That's what you guys play,
                   right?
             Yeah.

347
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:37,395
                   I mean,
            football maybe, too.

348
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:39,597
         I am a huge fan
         of pork belly.

349
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:42,100
  The texture, the crunchiness,
  the flavor -- it's unmatched.

350
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:43,201
        It's really good.

351
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:44,302
            That's a pretty good
                description.
              Yeah.

352
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:46,037
He's an experienced eater,
  as you can tell.

353
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,739
          -Yeah, right.
         -Combo dukboki.

354
00:11:47,741 --> 00:11:49,307
      Pijiu belly's great.

355
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:52,477
They've got stuff that you can't
find at the pub down the street.

356
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:53,545
                And what does
               the name mean?

357
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:55,213
 "pijiu" in mandarin
    means "beer."

358
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:56,581
So it's a beer belly.

359
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:58,283
          Beer belly --
  you have to have great beer.

360
00:11:58,285 --> 00:12:00,652
 They keep a rotating beer menu
             on tap,

361
00:12:00,654 --> 00:12:02,487
       So I can always try
      something different.

362
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:03,655
           What else can you do?

363
00:12:03,657 --> 00:12:05,724
   How about some
korean yangnyeom chicken?

364
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:07,459
              That's just what
               I was thinking.

365
00:12:07,461 --> 00:12:08,893
Yangnyeom chicken's great.

366
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:12,964
 The sauce is not like any other
    sauce that I've ever had.

367
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:14,332
It's just packed full of flavor.

368
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:15,433
            You got to come back
                  for this.

369
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:16,434
              See you in a bit.

370
00:12:27,481 --> 00:12:29,414
              4, 3, 2, hit it.

371
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:32,183
We are here at
 pijiu belly,

372
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:33,685
  Atlanta, georgia.

373
00:12:33,687 --> 00:12:35,620
  I forgot everything you said.
       -No, you did good.

374
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:37,956
               You scared me,
       but it was a great intro.

375
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:39,290
       So, we're at pijiu belly,

376
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:41,192
              And chef lenny is
              just crushing it.

377
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:44,529
 They found a really nice blend
   of traditional korean foods

378
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:46,731
   With foods that you'd find
         in a gastropub.

379
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:48,733
   -If I'm hungry I come here.
       -It's a good place.

380
00:12:48,735 --> 00:12:50,268
             It is exceptional.

381
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,569
     And now what are we making,
                    chef?

382
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:53,738
 Yangnyeom chicken.

383
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:57,275
  The sauce on this chicken has
  that perfect blend of spice.

384
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:59,377
Even though it's covered
  in a lot of sauce,

385
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:02,113
     It's still very crispy.

386
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,315
              That goes perfect
              for selling beer.
   Absolutely.

387
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:05,550
    You sell a lot of beer here,
                 don't you?

388
00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:07,318
          -We sure do.
         -"we sure do."

389
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,054
        All of a sudden you talk
       like you're from atlanta.

390
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:11,523
"we sure do."

391
00:13:11,525 --> 00:13:12,924
so, we got whole roasters...

392
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:15,126
Rotisserie seasoning,
    kosher salt.

393
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,995
             Korean chili flake.
      Rub this over the chicken.

394
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:18,963
             -Right.
        -This excalibur?

395
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:20,965
                Skewer it up.
   And how long will this roast?

396
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,801
   For two hours,
     500 degree.

397
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:24,836
           And are we gonna make
            the yangnyeom sauce?

398
00:13:24,838 --> 00:13:26,304
          -Yes, we are.
           -Fantastic.

399
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:29,374
We have ketchup, black pepper,
    dried chili,

400
00:13:29,376 --> 00:13:32,076
Korean chili pepper,
 good ol' soy sauce.

401
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:33,111
                 "good ol'."

402
00:13:33,113 --> 00:13:35,580
White vinegar, sriracha,
   minced garlic,

403
00:13:35,582 --> 00:13:37,415
 Granulated garlic,
       sugar.

404
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:38,416
             You and your sugar.

405
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:41,085
  Corn syrup, cola,
   the gochujang.

406
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:43,188
      That's a lot of gochujang.
                  Next up?

407
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:45,523
  -The chicken -- chop them up.
        -What's our mix?

408
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:47,759
Corn starch and flour
   and rice flour.

409
00:13:47,761 --> 00:13:48,893
             Drop in the fryer.

410
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:51,229
        -Fire up the wok.
        -Yangnyeom sauce.

411
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,431
              Reducing it a bit
       and just making it sticky

412
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:54,966
            To coat the chicken.

413
00:13:54,968 --> 00:13:56,501
Toasty sesame seeds.

414
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:57,735
            I don't know whether
                to attack it

415
00:13:57,737 --> 00:13:59,337
        Or take a picture of it.

416
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:03,308
         That is dangerous, bro.

417
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:04,609
okay.

418
00:14:04,611 --> 00:14:07,011
          You've got great crisp
     on the little bit of batter

419
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:08,246
                That you put
               on the outside.

420
00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:10,315
           The sauce is tangy...

421
00:14:10,317 --> 00:14:12,884
            And sweet, with just
           a little bit of heat.

422
00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:15,353
              That's dynamite.
               Excellent job.

423
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:18,089
       -Yangnyeom chicken.
  -The sauce is very elevated.

424
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:20,024
       Perfect sweetness,
       perfect spiciness.

425
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:21,192
         Kung pao ramen.

426
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:23,061
Lenny and lili
    are just amazing.

427
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:24,896
            They're kind of like
           another family to us.

428
00:14:24,898 --> 00:14:27,098
           She has had
   her rehearsal dinner here.

429
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,700
              I had
     my 60th birthday here.

430
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:30,101
      Come on.

431
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:32,337
Everything I've ever
 ordered has been amazing,

432
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:33,838
       And I can say that
         wholeheartedly.

433
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,106
I really like your story.

434
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:37,909
       You're super-enthusiastic
        about everything you do.

435
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:39,143
             What are we doing?
              What's going on?

436
00:14:39,145 --> 00:14:40,211
          You gonna bring it in?
     I'm bringing it.

437
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:41,479
                Bring it in.
                There you go.

438
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:43,081
    Come on down
   to pijiu belly

439
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,549
    And try some
of the yangnyeom chicken

440
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:46,985
 And the pork belly
and have lots of beer, too.

441
00:14:46,987 --> 00:14:48,887
                See you here.
                   Adios.

442
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:52,423
Coming up,
 in kennewick, washington...

443
00:14:52,425 --> 00:14:53,424
                That's legit.

444
00:14:53,426 --> 00:14:54,893
        ...A joint known
        for their beer...

445
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:56,027
       They go above and beyond,
                   right?

446
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:57,896
      ...But making a mark
        with their menu.

447
00:14:57,898 --> 00:14:59,230
           That right there gets
              all the respect.

448
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:08,806
       It's been taking your dad
             like half an hour.

449
00:15:08,808 --> 00:15:10,141
              Let me just see.
              The kid's a pro!

450
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:11,776
       'kay, how much should you
              be paid for this?

451
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:14,479
              -75.
    -75 cents -- you got it.

452
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:19,784
          Got top love
     the great northwest --

453
00:15:19,786 --> 00:15:22,620
    Known for so many things,
and one in particular is beer --

454
00:15:22,622 --> 00:15:24,856
      I mean, in every way,
         shape, or form.

455
00:15:24,858 --> 00:15:26,791
      So I'm in tri-cities,
           washington,

456
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:29,394
     Where this joint was --
   well, it was a sport's bar,

457
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:30,728
   Then it was a comedy club,

458
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:33,031
 And now a husband-and-wife team
       have come together,

459
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:34,232
  And they're serving up beer.

460
00:15:34,234 --> 00:15:36,267
 It's like an epicenter of beer
            backed up

461
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:39,070
  With some real-deal barbecue
 and some scratch-made sausages.

462
00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:41,139
   This is barley's brew hub.

463
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:44,776
        Got another brat
         on the flattop!

464
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:46,010
      The food is fabulous.

465
00:15:46,012 --> 00:15:48,179
     -Pulled-pork sandwich.
       -Always made fresh.

466
00:15:48,181 --> 00:15:49,580
Goes great with all their beers.

467
00:15:49,582 --> 00:15:51,115
                This is like
            a gigantic dorm room

468
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:52,583
                Of beer signs
                and handles.

469
00:15:52,585 --> 00:15:53,885
             Who's the curator?

470
00:15:53,887 --> 00:15:55,253
             Who's the sommelier
              of the beer here?
      Me.

471
00:15:55,255 --> 00:15:56,321
          -That's you?
             -Yeah.

472
00:15:56,323 --> 00:15:57,555
             Where did the food
               come into play?

473
00:15:57,557 --> 00:16:00,458
          I didn't want
     the basic bar-pub menu,

474
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,560
   So we're smoking our meats.

475
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:05,830
And tom and shari floyd
 are going beyond the basic.

476
00:16:05,832 --> 00:16:07,231
Chicken gyro sausage!

477
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:09,467
     Normally gyros are made
           with lamb.

478
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,102
Here they use chicken bratwurst.

479
00:16:11,104 --> 00:16:12,904
      I've never found that
        anywhere before.

480
00:16:12,906 --> 00:16:15,773
                We're making
       the chicken gyro sausage?
     Correct.

481
00:16:15,775 --> 00:16:17,575
        All right, let's see it,
                  captain.

482
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:18,943
      Bacon...

483
00:16:18,945 --> 00:16:21,379
 Boneless, skinless
   chicken thighs,

484
00:16:21,381 --> 00:16:24,282
Kosher salt, ground oregano,
slightly ground thyme.

485
00:16:24,284 --> 00:16:26,651
          Is there an attachment
          for "slightly ground"?

486
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:28,920
    Course basil,
chopped baby spinach,

487
00:16:28,922 --> 00:16:29,787
    Feta cheese.

488
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:30,922
         Don't forgeta the feta.

489
00:16:30,924 --> 00:16:32,757
   Kalamata brine,
      dry milk.

490
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:33,825
        The dry milk is the key.

491
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:35,159
     -It retains moisture...
             -Yeah.

492
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:36,794
     ...And it's
  a protein binder.

493
00:16:36,796 --> 00:16:39,063
      And beer.
I use a kolsch yeast.

494
00:16:39,065 --> 00:16:40,298
That's top fermenting,

495
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,233
And then when they chill it,
it drops to the bottom,

496
00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:43,534
      And it's
a bottom-fermenting yeast.

497
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:45,003
   So it's kind of
 a different yeast,

498
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:46,404
   And that's what
  makes it unique.

499
00:16:46,406 --> 00:16:48,072
                   Koooom!

500
00:16:48,074 --> 00:16:49,674
             Right over my head.

501
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:52,210
             So we're gonna use
             a synthetic casing.
     21 inches.

502
00:16:52,212 --> 00:16:53,578
             This is gonna cook
       in the oven at what temp?

503
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:56,047
    300 for about
   10, 15 minutes.

504
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:58,383
              And we gonna give
        a little tzatziki sauce?
     You bet.

505
00:16:58,385 --> 00:16:59,817
    Greek yogurt,
    fresh garlic,

506
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:01,953
Ground black pepper,
   salt, dill....

507
00:17:01,955 --> 00:17:03,554
              That's big dill.

508
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:05,523
    ...Lemon zest
  and lemon juice,

509
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:08,059
     Fresh mint,
  english cucumber.

510
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:09,761
             Okay, are we gonna
               make this dish?

511
00:17:09,763 --> 00:17:11,462
Just came out of the oven.
'course, we have to...

512
00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:13,865
            Right, right, right.
             One for the homies.

513
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:15,733
      For the little bit of beer
           that we put in there,

514
00:17:15,735 --> 00:17:17,802
            I definitely get it.
  Get some lines on it.

515
00:17:17,804 --> 00:17:20,271
           Pita bread.
    -Lettuce, tzatziki sauce.

516
00:17:20,273 --> 00:17:22,140
           -Tomatoes.
          -Red onions.

517
00:17:22,142 --> 00:17:24,909
    Feta cheese.

518
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:26,611
               And that's all
                 she wrote.

519
00:17:29,115 --> 00:17:31,983
 A gyro out of chicken and bacon
               is a big risk.

520
00:17:31,985 --> 00:17:33,818
      I did it,
and it's doing good.

521
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,353
        I don't know that "good"
                  would be

522
00:17:35,355 --> 00:17:37,622
      The term that I would use.
             I think fantastic.

523
00:17:37,624 --> 00:17:39,457
               From the grind
           to the ingredients --

524
00:17:39,459 --> 00:17:40,925
                 Nothing is
       too heavy-handed in it --

525
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:43,327
         With a really nice pita
           that's nice and soft,

526
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:44,796
        A really clean tzatziki.

527
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:46,064
             What beer would you
            recommend with this?

528
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:47,198
      An I.P.A.

529
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,232
       -That's your go-to?
           -That's me.

530
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:49,834
             Out of bounds, bro.

531
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:51,836
    The chicken gyro sausage
      is perfectly cooked.

532
00:17:51,838 --> 00:17:54,005
           It's juicy,
   and it's got a great bite.

533
00:17:54,007 --> 00:17:56,240
 The tzatziki really highlights
            the meat.

534
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:58,009
But what really matters
   at this joint

535
00:17:58,011 --> 00:18:00,178
       Is how the flavors
       highlight the beer.

536
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,814
       Usually the server
 will pair beer with your food.

537
00:18:02,816 --> 00:18:05,316
 They'll help you find something
    that you enjoy drinking.

538
00:18:05,318 --> 00:18:07,785
        I expected with the beer
           being such the focus,

539
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:08,853
         The food would be good.

540
00:18:08,855 --> 00:18:10,288
                 But they go
        above and beyond, right?

541
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:12,156
    -That's why we come back.
     -That's the best part.

542
00:18:12,158 --> 00:18:13,324
 Brats on the sharp!

543
00:18:13,326 --> 00:18:14,659
       You can't go wrong
       with anything here.

544
00:18:14,661 --> 00:18:16,160
   I loved their smoked brat.

545
00:18:16,162 --> 00:18:17,562
 Chili on the brat!

546
00:18:17,564 --> 00:18:20,431
 The brat is great and just goes
    perfectly with the chili.

547
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,667
     It tastes like heaven.

548
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:24,735
     Starts with
 the chili paste --

549
00:18:24,737 --> 00:18:26,838
 New mexico chilies,
 california chilies.

550
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,239
            -Pasilla?
             -Water.

551
00:18:28,241 --> 00:18:29,941
    -A little beer -- I.P.A.?
              -No.

552
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:31,309
               He said I.P.A.
           Went with everything.

553
00:18:31,311 --> 00:18:33,744
Not when you're cooking.
I.P.A.S make things bitter.

554
00:18:33,746 --> 00:18:35,613
   So we're using
   a scottish ale.

555
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:37,482
  And a little bit
 of tomato bouillon.

556
00:18:37,484 --> 00:18:38,950
          This is the foundation
                of the chili?

557
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:40,485
     -The secret ingredient.
       -Secret ingredient?

558
00:18:40,487 --> 00:18:42,153
   -It's not a secret anymore.
     -I won't tell anybody.

559
00:18:42,155 --> 00:18:44,956
We are now doing the chili --
rendered bacon and onions.

560
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,125
          -Ground beef.
      -House-made chorizo.

561
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:49,994
         So, this is all getting
   a pre-cook before it goes in.

562
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:53,231
Ground thyme, ground oregano,
 table ground salt,

563
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:54,765
    Fresh-ground
    black pepper.

564
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:57,034
             -Cumin?
-Fresh toasted and fresh ground.

565
00:18:57,036 --> 00:18:59,003
        -Nice. I like it.
 -It really makes a difference.

566
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:01,105
    Chili powder.
   Garlic powder.

567
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:02,273
Fresh-squeezed lime.

568
00:19:02,275 --> 00:19:04,942
    Tomato sauce.
      Sriracha.

569
00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:06,844
   Worcestershire.
               Scottish ale?

570
00:19:06,846 --> 00:19:09,413
      -This is a scottish.
   -Ah, see? I'm catching on.

571
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:12,183
Crushed green chilies.
The secret chili paste.
                     Yeah.

572
00:19:12,185 --> 00:19:14,886
      No new mexico, california,
                or pasillas?

573
00:19:14,888 --> 00:19:15,953
      Nothing.

574
00:19:15,955 --> 00:19:17,889
   Ground tomatoes
with roasted chilies,

575
00:19:17,891 --> 00:19:19,257
   And some water.

576
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:21,425
  Red kidney beans.
    Black beans.

577
00:19:21,427 --> 00:19:22,860
      Garbanzo.
                     Chicks.

578
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:23,895
    Pinto beans.

579
00:19:23,897 --> 00:19:25,429
   You let it cook
   for four hours.

580
00:19:25,431 --> 00:19:27,965
The chili cheese brat.
This is the chili part.

581
00:19:27,967 --> 00:19:29,500
            Oh, now you're doing
               dance routines?
     Yeah.

582
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:30,935
        Just let me see it again
               one more time.

583
00:19:30,937 --> 00:19:32,603
 Chili cheese brat.

584
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:34,906
             This is the chili.
              We got the chili.

585
00:19:34,908 --> 00:19:35,840
           Next is coming the...

586
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:37,275
             -Brat.
            -Got it.

587
00:19:37,277 --> 00:19:38,576
Fresh-ground pork butt,

588
00:19:38,578 --> 00:19:40,311
Coarse-ground mustard seed,

589
00:19:40,313 --> 00:19:41,913
        Sage,
 fresh-ground cumin,

590
00:19:41,915 --> 00:19:44,482
Ground black pepper,
 salt, onion powder,

591
00:19:44,484 --> 00:19:47,685
 Granulated garlic,
  nutmeg, and mace.

592
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:49,020
We're gonna mix this up.

593
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:51,189
    Milk protein
and a german pilsner...

594
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:52,657
         -There you go.
    -...'cause it is a brat.

595
00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:54,258
           -Case this?
              -Yes.

596
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,660
This goes on the smoker

597
00:19:55,662 --> 00:19:59,096
 Until the internal
 temperature's 165.

598
00:19:59,098 --> 00:20:01,365
       We take
our locally baked roll.

599
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:03,434
       -Smoked bratwurst.
          -House chili.

600
00:20:03,436 --> 00:20:05,369
          Cheese sauce.
         -Green onions.

601
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:07,205
        -Shredded cheese.
    -What's the white sauce?

602
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:10,107
    Cilantro-lime
     sour cream.

603
00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:11,742
     That's it.

604
00:20:13,313 --> 00:20:14,712
               Great texture.

605
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:16,714
                Little smoke.
               Dynamite chili.

606
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:19,517
Chili dogs don't get the respect
             that they used to.

607
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:21,118
           That right there gets
              all the respect.

608
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,720
       Scratch-meat ingredients,
                   cheese,

609
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:23,654
                  A little
            fresh green onion --

610
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:24,755
              That whole little
                package deal.

611
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:25,990
      You're running a beer hub,

612
00:20:25,992 --> 00:20:28,392
   And you want to be recognized
               for your food.

613
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:29,493
                That's legit.

614
00:20:29,495 --> 00:20:31,929
        -Cheese on brat!
    -It's a good smoked brat.

615
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:33,431
    One of the best I've had.

616
00:20:33,433 --> 00:20:36,400
   The chili is very layered,
      has good depth to it.

617
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:38,803
       Little bit of heat,
     but nothing too spicy.

618
00:20:38,805 --> 00:20:40,238
       Two game changers.

619
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,740
  Food's good. Drinks are good.
   You can't really go wrong.

620
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,375
    Doesn't say "barbecue house"
                 out there.

621
00:20:44,377 --> 00:20:46,043
             It said "brew hub."
     that's what
  we're going for.

622
00:20:46,045 --> 00:20:47,445
             This isn't playing
               second fiddle.

623
00:20:47,447 --> 00:20:49,614
             This is right there
                  up front.

624
00:20:49,616 --> 00:20:51,215
                 Delicious.
               Nice job, chef.

625
00:20:52,885 --> 00:20:55,820
   So, that wraps this edition
 of "diners, drive ins & dives".

626
00:20:55,822 --> 00:20:58,356
   If you want to get some of
 the recipes from today's show,

627
00:20:58,358 --> 00:21:00,124
     Go to foodnetwork.Com.

628
00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:01,659
     I'll be looking for you
            next week

629
00:21:01,661 --> 00:21:04,395
 On "diners, drive ins & dives".

630
00:21:04,397 --> 00:21:06,797
       12-hour duck cooked
          low and slow.

631
00:21:08,167 --> 00:21:10,034
 -Somebody just stole your car.
          -Take my car?

632
00:21:10,036 --> 00:21:11,235
    You didn't leave the keys
         in it, did you?

633
00:21:11,237 --> 00:21:13,437
I think I left the keys
    in your car.

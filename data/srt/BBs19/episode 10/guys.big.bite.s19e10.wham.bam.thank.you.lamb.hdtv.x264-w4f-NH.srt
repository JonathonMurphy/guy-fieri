1
00:00:17,385 --> 00:00:19,918
     Holidays are all about
     tradition, you know?

2
00:00:20,021 --> 00:00:21,820
  Now, Thanksgiving tradition,
  what is it?

3
00:00:21,922 --> 00:00:23,989
   Well, the one main thing is
   we have a huge feast,

4
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:26,291
  but the tradition is kind of
  the fact that we don't really

5
00:00:26,394 --> 00:00:28,560
    have any traditions--
    it usually just involves

6
00:00:28,662 --> 00:00:30,796
     me cooking for all
     my friends and family,

7
00:00:30,898 --> 00:00:32,698
        and that's what
        we got this year,

8
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,667
  starting off with my balsamic
  braised leg of lamb,

9
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:38,570
   cooked in a pressure cooker
   for maximum tenderness,

10
00:00:38,672 --> 00:00:41,373
     served with a rich,
     tangy balsamic glaze--

11
00:00:41,475 --> 00:00:43,008
    oh, you're gonna love it.

12
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,944
 Now, to go alongside,
 how about sweet potato gnocchi

13
00:00:46,047 --> 00:00:48,280
   in a parmesan butter sauce?

14
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:50,582
  Oh, you're definitely coming
  back for seconds on this,

15
00:00:50,684 --> 00:00:53,185
    and to round it all out,
    I'll whip up some peas

16
00:00:53,287 --> 00:00:55,988
      and prosciutto,
      a little lemon zest,
      a little chile flake.

17
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:58,657
    Super simple,
    but everybody loves this.

18
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:00,459
 Sweet potatoes gotta chill out
 here for a little bit,

19
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:02,327
    because they're a little
    hot to the touch,

20
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,463
    and that's gonna come
    together for the gnocchi.

21
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:06,532
 Just...wow, I don't even wanna
 start you on that.

22
00:01:06,634 --> 00:01:09,768
 Let's talk about this balsamic
 braised leg of lamb.

23
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:13,038
  So pressure cooker, you know,
  it's one of my favorite
  utensils to use,

24
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,340
and I've got this screamin' hot
stove out here,

25
00:01:15,443 --> 00:01:16,975
       but you don't need
       a really hot stove.

26
00:01:17,078 --> 00:01:19,511
     All you need is
     a pressure cooker that
     can handle everything.

27
00:01:19,613 --> 00:01:21,713
     So get some heat goin'.

28
00:01:21,816 --> 00:01:24,249
    Little bit of olive oil,

29
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:26,285
      and let's talk about
      leg of lamb.

30
00:01:26,387 --> 00:01:28,487
  I remember when I was a kid,
  my dad cooked leg of lamb.

31
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:30,689
       Took the whole leg,
       hoof and all,

32
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:33,392
   stuffed it with garlic,
   roasted it on the barbecue,

33
00:01:33,494 --> 00:01:35,427
   and I just remember askin'
   my friends at school,

34
00:01:35,529 --> 00:01:37,362
       "So what'd you have
       for Thanksgiving?"

35
00:01:37,465 --> 00:01:39,498
 And everybody said, "Well,
 we had the turkey and so far."

36
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,333
  I said, "We had leg of lamb."

37
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:44,303
   People just looked at me
   cross-eyed, but that's just
   the way it's always been.

38
00:01:44,405 --> 00:01:46,505
     So for the leg of lamb,
     we're talkin' about
     a whole leg of lamb.

39
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:49,074
  Had the butcher bone it out,
  but I kept the bone.

40
00:01:49,176 --> 00:01:51,510
     It's nice and trim,
     not too much fat on it.

41
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:53,912
      Liberal with
      the salt and pepper.

42
00:01:54,014 --> 00:01:56,081
   Fresh cracked black pepper.

43
00:01:56,183 --> 00:01:58,851
    Now the key was to really
    sear off the lamb.

44
00:01:58,953 --> 00:02:01,787
I only did two pieces at a time
to build a really nice crust.

45
00:02:01,889 --> 00:02:04,089
      We'll drop those in.

46
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:07,025
   Takes a little bit of time,
   didn't pre-flour that.

47
00:02:07,128 --> 00:02:09,027
   Remember, I want that crust
   to build on the meat.

48
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:11,563
      So we'll turn that
      a few times, okay?
      Let me wash my hands.

49
00:02:17,338 --> 00:02:20,672
       Okay.
       Now to the gnocchi.

50
00:02:20,774 --> 00:02:23,342
    So great thing about
    sweet potatoes is, well,

51
00:02:23,444 --> 00:02:24,843
    people get them mixed up
    all the time.

52
00:02:24,945 --> 00:02:26,645
      Is it a yam?
      Is it a sweet potato?

53
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:29,748
   Well, we're talkin' about
   the sweet potato, a little
   less starchy than the yam.

54
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:32,584
    So the idea here is cook
    these off ahead of time,

55
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:34,920
        or maybe you have
        some left over.

56
00:02:35,022 --> 00:02:37,389
    We're gonna get 'em cool
    to the touch,

57
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:39,224
   just to where we can kinda
   handle them a little bit.

58
00:02:42,963 --> 00:02:44,863
  Poked some holes in 'em,
  roasted 'em off in the oven,

59
00:02:44,965 --> 00:02:47,232
   just the normal way you'd
   cook 'em, and look at that.

60
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:49,968
  Look at that beautiful color,
  huh?

61
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,437
          Take this...

62
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,473
         into the bowl.

63
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:01,246
        Some grated parm.

64
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,248
       Maybe about 1 cup.

65
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,784
       A little olive oil,

66
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:07,986
  a couple tablespoons of that.

67
00:03:08,088 --> 00:03:09,655
     A little brown sugar--
     I know that we have

68
00:03:09,757 --> 00:03:11,657
   the sweetness of
   the sweet potato goin' on,

69
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:14,459
    but a little brown sugar
    will go a long way.

70
00:03:18,132 --> 00:03:20,899
    A little salt and pepper,
    there we go.

71
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:24,336
     And here's where
     we really start adding

72
00:03:24,438 --> 00:03:27,039
  the subtle flavor,
  but the flavor that
  everybody'll go, like, "Why?

73
00:03:27,141 --> 00:03:29,074
   Why does this gnocchi taste
   so fantastic?"

74
00:03:29,176 --> 00:03:32,044
     It's this--we're gonna
     use a little thyme,
     a little fresh thyme.

75
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:40,185
    So a little bit of thyme,

76
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:42,321
     and last but not least,

77
00:03:42,423 --> 00:03:44,323
       you say holidays,
       what do you think?
       You think nutmeg.

78
00:03:49,363 --> 00:03:51,530
      Okay, lock that down.

79
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:53,765
  Let that slowly whip together
  there for a second.

80
00:03:57,504 --> 00:03:59,871
           Turn it up.

81
00:03:59,974 --> 00:04:01,907
       We're gonna really
       let that fluff up.

82
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:04,042
We're really gonna put a lot of
air into that and aerate it.

83
00:04:04,144 --> 00:04:06,478
It's gonna be nice and--that'll
help it get nice and creamy,

84
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,214
 'cause remember, on a gnocchi,
 you don't want those dense,

85
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:12,117
little hard pillows--you want it
to be nice, light, and fluffy.

86
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:14,553
   All right, back over here.

87
00:04:14,655 --> 00:04:17,356
  Lamb's got a nice sear to it.

88
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:23,428
       To the other side.

89
00:04:28,836 --> 00:04:30,969
              Okay.

90
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:32,971
       Take the bling off.

91
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:40,612
          There we go.

92
00:04:43,484 --> 00:04:45,484
 Now this right here looks like
 pumpkin pie filling,

93
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:47,619
    just in the savory sense.

94
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:49,488
         Bring this off.

95
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:55,761
Need a little bench flour here.

96
00:04:55,863 --> 00:04:59,464
Now, I was gonna be using maybe
up to 2 cups of flour for this,

97
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:02,167
  but we're really gonna be
  looking for what the texture

98
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:04,169
   of this is gonna look like.

99
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:06,471
      We want it to be
      a little bit pliable.

100
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:15,047
    Seems like a little now,
    but there's a ton
    of flavor in that.

101
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:18,283
Again, just the opportunity
to repurpose that sweet potato.

102
00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:19,951
    Could've been left over--
    you know how you have

103
00:05:20,054 --> 00:05:21,953
   the big Thanksgiving party
   the night before?

104
00:05:22,056 --> 00:05:24,389
    Well, the great thing is,
    you can cook off
    those sweet potatoes,

105
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:27,025
  had 'em done and ready to go,
  just one less thing

106
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:29,494
   that you have to cook on
   that actual big turkey day.

107
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:31,797
           All right.

108
00:05:36,804 --> 00:05:38,704
          There we go.

109
00:05:38,806 --> 00:05:40,906
   Need a little more flour...

110
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:43,175
    right up on top of that.

111
00:05:43,277 --> 00:05:45,777
    Lightly start putting it
    together.

112
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,449
      Oh, this is perfect.

113
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:52,617
 Okay, so here's the game plan.

114
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,286
   Still searing off the lamb.

115
00:05:54,388 --> 00:05:56,421
Don't worry, the balsamic part's
coming in just a little bit.

116
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,523
  What I'm gonna do is continue
  to add flour to this.

117
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:01,293
   Knead this dough through,
   get it into a floured bowl,

118
00:06:01,395 --> 00:06:03,562
   and let it rest for about
   30 minutes, you come back,

119
00:06:03,664 --> 00:06:06,131
   it's, uh, Thanksgiving day
   at the Fieri house,

120
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:08,467
     uh, at the ranch,
     you're gonna love this.

121
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:10,569
      I needed more flour,
      and now the hands are
      already gummy.

122
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:12,804
     Can you give me a hand?
     I'll get it.

123
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:25,851
   Welcome back--
   Thanksgiving at the ranch.

124
00:06:25,953 --> 00:06:27,986
    I'll tell ya something--
    making gnocchi,

125
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:31,123
 it takes a lot of time--well,
 it doesn't take a lot of time,
 it takes patience,

126
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:34,393
because you're working with
something really super delicate,

127
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:37,596
  so what I've got here is some
  sweet potatoes I cooked
  ahead of time,

128
00:06:37,698 --> 00:06:40,532
   made this fantastic little
   mixture with a little bit
   of thyme,

129
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:43,135
    a lot of parmesan cheese,
    and some olive oil,

130
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:46,505
    and now I'm just lightly
    kneading in the flour.

131
00:06:46,607 --> 00:06:48,907
   It's not an exact science,
   because I don't know how
   many sweet potatoes

132
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:51,109
   I'm gonna have and how wet
   they're going to be,

133
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:54,479
so I'm just working them enough,
just to where they're not tacky,

134
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:57,482
 and I'm gonna be able to start
 to roll them out to make

135
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:59,584
    those little dumplings--
    now, over there,

136
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:03,288
  you hear sizzling and popping
  going on for a good reason,
  because that's going to be--

137
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,956
       well, this is
       the non-traditional

138
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:07,359
Thanksgiving here at the house,
and that is going to be

139
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:10,896
a balsamic-braised leg of lamb,

140
00:07:10,998 --> 00:07:13,298
      and I think that just
      covers that.

141
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,000
              Okay.

142
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:17,169
             This...

143
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:20,705
        a touch of flour
        inside the bowl,

144
00:07:20,808 --> 00:07:24,910
      pick that up,
      let it just rest here

145
00:07:25,012 --> 00:07:27,145
     for just, ah,
     maybe about 30 minutes.

146
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:30,148
   And bones out of the oven.

147
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:33,552
        Now, I had this--

148
00:07:33,654 --> 00:07:35,720
      I had this fantastic
      leg of lamb

149
00:07:35,823 --> 00:07:38,256
    that I had the butcher go
    and break down for me.

150
00:07:38,358 --> 00:07:41,293
  What I had him do is take it
  and just really nicely--

151
00:07:41,395 --> 00:07:43,328
      he just opened it up,
      took the leg out,

152
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,530
gave me all the meat,
trimmed a little bit of the fat,

153
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:48,033
     and that's what's
     taking place over here,

154
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:51,670
  as I've got this leg of lamb
  that I've been searing off.

155
00:07:51,772 --> 00:07:54,873
 Look at that--look at the nice
 caramelization and crunch.

156
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:56,475
     I couldn't fit the bone
     in there.

157
00:07:56,577 --> 00:07:58,610
    I mean, I'm going to fit
    the bone in there,
    but I couldn't really

158
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:00,645
    get the roast on it,
    so throw it in the oven,

159
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:02,714
 regular oven, wood-fired oven,
 doesn't matter.

160
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:06,117
    Okay, now we get into
    this balsamic braised...

161
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:09,588
  Little bit of jalapeno--
  it just--we're gonna go with

162
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:12,090
        a nice rough cut.

163
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:15,727
     All these veggies,
     because we're gonna
     strain this out later.

164
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:18,763
        Red bell pepper.

165
00:08:18,866 --> 00:08:21,933
 The real key is coming up here
 in just a second,

166
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:24,503
       and that's gonna be
       the balsamic.

167
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:27,739
          There we go.

168
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:30,375
     A little bit of onion.

169
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,248
     This could all be done
     ahead of time also.

170
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,717
        A little fennel.

171
00:08:38,819 --> 00:08:41,019
       Fennel goes in this
       really great.

172
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:43,421
       Think about mixin'
       that balsamic...

173
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:45,790
              Okay.

174
00:08:45,893 --> 00:08:48,226
    A little chopped garlic.

175
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:50,228
 Don't wanna chop it down
 too much, 'cause they've gotta

176
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,398
       survive in this pot
       and not burn.

177
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,400
    We're gonna let this all
    sweat right now.

178
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:57,402
   I'm gonna bring the heat up
   just a touch.

179
00:08:57,504 --> 00:08:59,604
   One of my favorite things
   to work with in the kitchen

180
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,139
     is the pressure cooker,

181
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:03,475
    so what I've done here is
    gotten a leg of lamb,

182
00:09:03,577 --> 00:09:06,077
       had it boned out,
       and cooked it down

183
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:08,413
      with this really nice
      balsamic reduction.

184
00:09:08,515 --> 00:09:11,349
We start with some tomato paste,
1/2 cup,

185
00:09:11,451 --> 00:09:14,185
     a little molasses--
     that's the real kicker.

186
00:09:14,288 --> 00:09:16,821
      Maybe 2 tablespoons--
      one...

187
00:09:16,924 --> 00:09:18,957
              two.

188
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:21,426
        Some beef stock--

189
00:09:21,528 --> 00:09:24,162
      1 quart, low sodium.

190
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:26,898
     Remember, we seasoned--
     liberally, we seasoned
     that lamb.

191
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,367
     And, of course,
     some balsamic vinegar.

192
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:34,239
       This is flavor city
       right here, folks.

193
00:09:34,341 --> 00:09:36,508
   Okay, about 2 cups of that.

194
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,610
     And then drop the meat

195
00:09:38,712 --> 00:09:40,879
     back in
     with all the aromatics,

196
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:43,148
    with all that big flavor,
    and so now,

197
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,651
     back in, nestle all of
     these inside.

198
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:49,554
You gotta be conscious of this--
if you're gonna go to the top,

199
00:09:49,656 --> 00:09:53,024
      you only can go
      about 3/4 of the way,

200
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:56,061
    and then I'm gonna throw
    the bones right in there

201
00:09:56,163 --> 00:09:58,697
  for good flavor on top of it.

202
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:01,900
    We will lock
    the pressure cooker down.

203
00:10:02,002 --> 00:10:04,369
        Okay, now here's
        the key to this.

204
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:07,038
     Every pressure cooker's
     different, get to know
     your pressure cooker.

205
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,107
      Become friends with
      your pressure cooker,

206
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:11,509
  because here's what happens--
  we're gonna get this up

207
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:14,346
  to about 15psi,
  and that's the perfect time--

208
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:17,716
  perfect pressure to cook it
  with, and about medium heat,

209
00:10:17,818 --> 00:10:20,185
   about 45 minutes, gonna be
   super shred-apart tender.

210
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,721
  Come back, gonna do gnocchi,
  I'll clean all this up.

211
00:10:22,823 --> 00:10:24,789
We're having the un-traditional
traditional Thanksgiving

212
00:10:24,891 --> 00:10:26,791
      at the Fieri house--
      see you in a bit.

213
00:10:37,571 --> 00:10:39,871
Welcome back to
the un-traditional Thanksgiving.

214
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:42,674
    Ah, listen, this is where
    it should be a tradition,

215
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:44,776
because this dish is outrageous.

216
00:10:44,878 --> 00:10:47,045
So what I'm doing is I've taken
a little prosciutto,

217
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:49,314
and I'm gonna crisp it up here,
and this is one of

218
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:51,449
   my favorite Italian dishes.

219
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:53,985
    You take the prosciutto,
    which everybody loves
    prosciutto,

220
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:56,054
     but not a lot of people
     have had it cooked.

221
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:59,424
 So you slice it thin and then
 cut some julienne strips of it

222
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:01,526
    and cook that down,
    you get this really nice,

223
00:11:01,628 --> 00:11:03,962
      salty, almost crunchy
      like bacon.

224
00:11:04,064 --> 00:11:06,464
         Get that in...

225
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:10,168
        Let me get...
        the shallots in.

226
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,473
There we go, and we'll just let
this mellow out for a second.

227
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:17,442
    What I have here
    is the star of the show,

228
00:11:17,544 --> 00:11:19,210
     and it's the lamb--
     now the lamb's been in

229
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:21,846
     the pressure cooker
     for, oh, I don't know,

230
00:11:21,948 --> 00:11:24,649
   about 45 minutes--
   big, beautiful leg of lamb.

231
00:11:24,751 --> 00:11:27,018
 Had the local butcher take it,

232
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,087
        debone it for me.

233
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:31,756
Now I've got it in the pressure
cooker with a little molasses,

234
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:34,526
  some beef broth, we've got...

235
00:11:34,628 --> 00:11:37,862
  a little balsamic--
  actually, a lot of balsamic.

236
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:39,664
   Now you see what I just did
   right there?

237
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:42,200
    I've been braising that.
    First I seared it off,
    a little salt, pepper,

238
00:11:42,302 --> 00:11:44,536
  seared it off with a little
  olive oil, I've got jalapenos

239
00:11:44,638 --> 00:11:46,838
      and some onions
      and some bell pepper,
      some fennel.

240
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,441
Oh, the fennel and the balsamic
go together great,
but what I did is

241
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:53,044
I just dropped it in here,
and cooling down the temperature

242
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:55,313
    and releasing the steam,
    I'm gonna be able
    to open this up

243
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:58,016
  a lot quicker than I would
  normally be able to if I just

244
00:11:58,118 --> 00:11:59,684
released the steam on the stove.

245
00:11:59,786 --> 00:12:01,486
       You hear that?
       Aw, it's fantastic.

246
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:03,321
    Best trick in the world,
    'cause a lot of times,

247
00:12:03,423 --> 00:12:05,223
you're sittin' there, waitin'
for it to just kinda decompress

248
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:07,392
 before you can get it to open,
 so let's see...

249
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:09,561
       let's see if we're
       successful with it.

250
00:12:09,663 --> 00:12:11,830
    Voila, so you took it
    from super screamin' hot

251
00:12:11,932 --> 00:12:14,499
  at 15 pounds per square inch,
  the normal temp--

252
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:16,968
   the normal pressure
   that you'd be cooking
   in a pressure cooker with--

253
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,671
 and brought it down that quick
 by the ice bath.

254
00:12:19,773 --> 00:12:21,673
              Okay.

255
00:12:21,775 --> 00:12:24,175
   So here's that leg of lamb.

256
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:26,177
         And when I say

257
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,880
    fall-apart tender,
    I can barely get it out.

258
00:12:28,982 --> 00:12:30,882
  Have to bring this over here.

259
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:33,551
       Oh, just gorgeous.

260
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:36,354
   Now, I even took the bones,
   the leg bone,

261
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:39,124
       and roasted it off.

262
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:41,926
    Oh! This is exactly
    what we're talkin' about.

263
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:44,929
    All kinds of flavor built
    into the bottom of this.

264
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:47,632
 Get the last little bits here,

265
00:12:47,734 --> 00:12:50,602
and all that marrow inside
the legs, you know that's where

266
00:12:50,704 --> 00:12:52,971
the flavor's comin' from, okay.

267
00:12:53,073 --> 00:12:56,775
      Let me hold this off
      to the side.

268
00:12:56,877 --> 00:12:59,511
             There.

269
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:03,014
  Another pan,
  gonna strain the liquid now.

270
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,383
    You really gotta remember
    that little technique

271
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:07,385
   that I was just showing you
   about throwing it
   in the ice bath.

272
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:09,654
I tell ya, I've watched so many
people sit there, I was like,

273
00:13:09,756 --> 00:13:11,589
  is the pressure cooker done?
  Is it done? Is it done?

274
00:13:11,691 --> 00:13:14,359
That way right there,
we did it in literally seconds.

275
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:17,295
              Okay.

276
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:19,364
     The last little bit of
     the braising liquid.

277
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,268
            Perfect.

278
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:30,408
    And back onto the stove.
    Okay.

279
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,677
   Now back to where we were.

280
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:35,814
   The shallots, cookin' down
   with the prosciutto.

281
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:38,116
 If I threw the garlic in there
 when I put the shallots in,

282
00:13:38,218 --> 00:13:40,318
     you're gonna have
     that opportunity
     for it to go and burn,

283
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,654
 so now that I'm back to paying
 attention to it...

284
00:13:42,756 --> 00:13:45,423
       throw my garlic in.

285
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:49,360
 Touch more of the extra virgin
 olive oil.

286
00:13:49,462 --> 00:13:52,897
The flavor alone right here--
let me throw some heat on that,

287
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:54,399
   reduce it just a bit more.

288
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:56,000
    But look at the viscosity
    of that.

289
00:13:56,102 --> 00:13:58,303
Just a little bit of oil there,
but all that fat cookin' down

290
00:13:58,405 --> 00:14:00,104
    from that leg of lamb...

291
00:14:02,108 --> 00:14:04,375
      A little chile flake.

292
00:14:04,477 --> 00:14:07,445
    And I don't care if it's
    Thanksgiving or not,

293
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:09,681
   you are gonna try this pea
   recipe, 'cause you know how

294
00:14:09,783 --> 00:14:11,816
    prosciutto has that real
    distinct flavor to it?

295
00:14:11,918 --> 00:14:13,918
      The saltiness,
      the rich meat flavor?

296
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,521
 You do that,
 and then you drop--you drop...

297
00:14:16,623 --> 00:14:18,590
    Now, if you can get some
    fresh peas, go with it,

298
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:20,124
     but this time of year,
     you can't.

299
00:14:20,227 --> 00:14:21,759
    Frozen peas.
    I'm not a canned pea guy.

300
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:23,862
They're too mushy--frozen peas,
they're kinda frozen

301
00:14:23,964 --> 00:14:25,864
   at the moment of ripeness.

302
00:14:25,966 --> 00:14:28,967
      Right in...aw, yeah.

303
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:32,237
     Everybody in my family
     loves this dish.

304
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:34,873
              Okay.

305
00:14:34,975 --> 00:14:37,242
    And all really
    I'm going to do on these

306
00:14:37,344 --> 00:14:39,744
 is just warm 'em up,
 'cause I've cooked the garlic,

307
00:14:39,846 --> 00:14:41,913
   cooked the shallots,
   got the crispy prosciutto.

308
00:14:42,015 --> 00:14:43,848
           Let it be.

309
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:46,150
    Now, second star,
    the co-host of the show,

310
00:14:46,253 --> 00:14:48,353
   is this fantastic gnocchi.

311
00:14:48,455 --> 00:14:50,021
        We throw a little
        bench flour down.

312
00:14:50,123 --> 00:14:52,590
  Now, if you remember, the way
  I started things off is I had

313
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:54,125
  some leftover sweet potatoes,

314
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:57,161
   and if you don't, cook 'em
   and then just let 'em cool.

315
00:14:57,264 --> 00:15:00,965
  So I took the sweet potatoes,
  hit 'em with some
  parmesan cheese,

316
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:03,534
        some olive oil,
        some fresh thyme,

317
00:15:03,637 --> 00:15:06,104
   kneaded it in
   a little bit of the flour,

318
00:15:06,206 --> 00:15:08,473
  and then I let it rest there
  in a floured bowl.

319
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:11,276
Now, cut off a manageable piece,

320
00:15:11,378 --> 00:15:13,811
  a little bit of flour,
  and what we're lookin' for--

321
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:15,880
   let me just kinda show you
   the doughiness of this.

322
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:18,082
        It's kinda tender
        like a pillow.

323
00:15:18,184 --> 00:15:20,518
    Not dense, not hard--
    for the size that it is,

324
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,720
   it's really kinda nice
   and light, kinda feels like

325
00:15:22,822 --> 00:15:24,622
      it might be a pastry,
      so I'm just gonna

326
00:15:24,724 --> 00:15:27,392
     lightly roll this out.
     There we go.

327
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:31,696
  A little bit more manageable
  piece to work with.

328
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:35,033
      Uniform size
      so they cook equally.

329
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:37,035
 Okay? And we'll just knock off

330
00:15:37,137 --> 00:15:38,870
      little 1-inch pieces.

331
00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:44,575
          There we go.

332
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:48,947
   About 1 tablespoon of salt
   to a gallon of water.

333
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:51,382
    Remember that,
    and you definitely
    need it with the gnocchi.

334
00:15:54,554 --> 00:15:56,688
   Start droppin' these little
   dumplings down.

335
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,356
     When they float,
     they're gonna be done.

336
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,925
We're gonna work 'em in batches,
pull 'em out, let 'em cool.

337
00:16:01,027 --> 00:16:03,861
  It's all comin' together.
  The meat's done, shred that.

338
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:05,997
     Got the peas over here
     with the prosciutto.

339
00:16:06,099 --> 00:16:08,266
   Reducing the glaze mixture.
   Huh.

340
00:16:08,368 --> 00:16:10,702
 Un-traditional, but definitely
 will be a tradition

341
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:13,004
  at your family, I bet--
  I'll see you in a little bit.

342
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:14,706
     We'll tie this all up.

343
00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:26,484
   That's how I want 'em done.

344
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:28,987
      Beautiful gnocchi,
      sweet potato gnocchi

345
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:31,289
   with a little bit of thyme
   and parmesan cheese,

346
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:34,459
all comin' together for
the traditional un-traditional,

347
00:16:34,561 --> 00:16:37,328
 uh, items that we make here at
 the Fieri house, at the ranch,

348
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:39,497
       for Thanksgiving--
       now look at those.

349
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:41,566
   A little bit of saltwater,
   took the sweet potato,

350
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:44,369
  mixed up the parmesan cheese,
  gonna let these rest
  for just a second.

351
00:16:44,471 --> 00:16:47,772
Got some of that braising liquid
reduced for the fantastic lamb

352
00:16:47,874 --> 00:16:50,808
  sitting down there--here's
  the peas and the prosciutto.

353
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:53,277
    This is what happens
    all the time, people pick
    all the prosciutto

354
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:56,147
      right out of the top.
      Fantastic.

355
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:58,816
      Now, let me tell you
      about this one thing

356
00:16:58,918 --> 00:17:00,885
      I gotta do, gotta hit
      a little lemon zest

357
00:17:00,987 --> 00:17:03,021
    right on top of the peas
    and prosciutto.

358
00:17:03,123 --> 00:17:05,690
         Nice and salty.

359
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:08,960
Frozen peas, wish that they were
fresh, but they're really--

360
00:17:09,062 --> 00:17:11,029
       frozen's way better
       than the can.

361
00:17:11,131 --> 00:17:13,331
   A little bit of chile flake
   in there, and this little
   lemon zest

362
00:17:13,433 --> 00:17:16,534
       at the end, just...
       adds that

363
00:17:16,636 --> 00:17:18,870
    nice little citrus note--
    not the citrus, but just

364
00:17:18,972 --> 00:17:20,738
     that lemony oil...okay.

365
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,807
  Gnocchi, I'm just lettin' 'em
  cool for a second.

366
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:24,509
     Over here, I've got
     a little brown butter.

367
00:17:24,611 --> 00:17:27,278
   So what I did is I started
   a pan--I'm gonna fire it
   back up now--

368
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,181
  I started a cold pan,
  dropped the butter in there,

369
00:17:30,283 --> 00:17:32,583
  and then slowly let it brown.

370
00:17:32,685 --> 00:17:34,585
     If you drop the butter
     into a hot pan,

371
00:17:34,687 --> 00:17:36,587
 automatically starts to brown,
 automatically starts

372
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:39,323
    to turn on you, and then
    you're chasing it down.

373
00:17:39,426 --> 00:17:41,692
   So this right here,
   I've got it rendered down,

374
00:17:41,795 --> 00:17:43,995
  I got a bunch of heat on it,

375
00:17:44,097 --> 00:17:46,731
get it right to the brown butter
look that I'm lookin' for.

376
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:49,567
        It's gettin' nice
        and golden, okay.

377
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:51,836
        Gets that little
        nuttiness to it.

378
00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:54,038
      Now we'll go ahead...

379
00:17:56,109 --> 00:17:58,276
          drop this in,

380
00:17:58,378 --> 00:18:01,979
 and just giving these a chance
 to cool down a little bit,

381
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:04,082
   just to dry out the touch.

382
00:18:08,154 --> 00:18:10,354
     The thyme in there,
     and all we're gonna do

383
00:18:10,457 --> 00:18:12,623
is just coat this a little bit.

384
00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:15,359
      I gotta grab
      some parmesan cheese.

385
00:18:15,462 --> 00:18:17,829
       Okay, let that coat
       up a little bit.

386
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:20,031
    A little more heat
    on that braising liquid.

387
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:28,773
  A little parm on top of that,
  and that's all she wrote.

388
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:32,710
      They're already nice
      and warm, okay.

389
00:18:32,812 --> 00:18:35,079
             Now...

390
00:18:35,181 --> 00:18:37,348
  bring this over to the lamb.

391
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:41,385
   So I've got that balsamic--
   the balsamic braised lamb

392
00:18:41,488 --> 00:18:45,156
  that I took the leg of lamb,
  had it boned out,

393
00:18:45,258 --> 00:18:48,359
    kept the bone,
    roasted that in the oven,

394
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:51,629
  then took the lamb, seared it
  off in the pressure cooker,

395
00:18:51,731 --> 00:18:55,099
hit it with a bunch of veggies,
got some peppers
and some fennel.

396
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:56,868
    Gotta love that in there.

397
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,803
 Then went with some onions
 and some garlic, little bit of

398
00:18:58,905 --> 00:19:01,606
  the jalapeno, then came in
  with the balsamic, of course,

399
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:04,041
    that's the name,
    but the key little hid--

400
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:07,278
    the little bit hiding
    in there is the molasses.

401
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,580
   Oh! Of course,
   some beef stock made it in.

402
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:13,284
      There's that tender,
      pillowy gnocchi.

403
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:18,122
        Last little bit.

404
00:19:18,224 --> 00:19:20,925
    Some of the brown butter.

405
00:19:23,563 --> 00:19:25,663
          Look at that.

406
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:28,099
          Look at that.

407
00:19:30,436 --> 00:19:32,570
 Spoon that right over the top.

408
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,772
  You've got--I'm telling you,
  talk about tender lamb.

409
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:36,941
   I mean,
   it's just fork-fall-apart,

410
00:19:37,043 --> 00:19:40,945
  and you know that everybody's
  got their traditions
  and what they like.

411
00:19:41,047 --> 00:19:42,947
  Our family,
  we just can't stick with one.

412
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:45,049
    Oh, we'll do a couple of
    the basics, but I gotta
    tell you something,

413
00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:47,118
    just the way that this is
    lookin' right now,

414
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,021
 this might make it--this might
 make it to next year's menu.

415
00:19:50,123 --> 00:19:51,956
   All right, let's give this
   a little taste.

416
00:19:53,626 --> 00:19:56,727
    All right.
    Nobody's lookin', right?

417
00:19:56,829 --> 00:19:59,263
 You're not supposed to eat off
 the platter. I know the rules.

418
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:01,399
   First, that little pillow.

419
00:20:01,501 --> 00:20:03,467
          Sweet potato.

420
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:05,336
               Mm.

421
00:20:05,438 --> 00:20:07,438
       Melt in your mouth.

422
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,640
     Light, super flavorful.

423
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:11,709
Fresh thyme--that's the kicker.

424
00:20:11,811 --> 00:20:14,378
      And right--little bit
      of parmesan cheese
      for the saltiness.

425
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,581
              Okay.

426
00:20:16,683 --> 00:20:18,316
      There's also a touch
      of nutmeg in there.

427
00:20:18,418 --> 00:20:20,451
  But look at this,
  when you get this leg of lamb

428
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,720
   that just--that, I mean,
   it looks like pulled pork.

429
00:20:25,525 --> 00:20:27,191
              Huh?

430
00:20:29,095 --> 00:20:31,395
      That's winner
      winner lamb dinner.
      I'm tellin' you what.

431
00:20:31,497 --> 00:20:34,632
 The holidays are an incredibly
 important time,

432
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:36,968
  time to give thanks,
  time to be with your family,

433
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:39,337
 time to be with your friends--
 no way better for me

434
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:41,439
 than to show my friends
 and family how much I love 'em

435
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:43,541
  than makin' a dish like that,
  look at that.

436
00:20:43,643 --> 00:20:46,644
     Scratch-made, homemade,
     real deal, right here.

437
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:49,447
  You're gonna get this recipe.
  Have a great Thanksgiving.

438
00:20:49,549 --> 00:20:51,682
       Thanks for watchin'
       "Guy's Big Bite."

439
00:20:51,784 --> 00:20:53,551

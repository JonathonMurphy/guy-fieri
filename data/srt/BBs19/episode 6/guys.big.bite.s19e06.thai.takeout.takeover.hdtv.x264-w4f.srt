1
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:19,318
    You know, living up here
     in Northern California,

2
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,121
    we have some of the best
    Thai food I've ever had.

3
00:00:22,123 --> 00:00:23,555
        But unfortunately
   when we're up at the ranch,

4
00:00:23,557 --> 00:00:25,324
 well, nobody delivers up here.

5
00:00:25,326 --> 00:00:27,292
    And my family, well they
      want their Thai food.

6
00:00:27,294 --> 00:00:30,062
    So I got to roll it out.
    And I got to do it legit.

7
00:00:30,064 --> 00:00:31,430
    We're starting off today

8
00:00:31,432 --> 00:00:33,432
          with my spicy
      Thai red beef curry.

9
00:00:33,434 --> 00:00:35,534
  Tender strips of flank steak
       with bell peppers,

10
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:38,337
      onions, and aromatics
   like lemongrass and ginger.

11
00:00:38,339 --> 00:00:39,838
        Now, you can't go
        wrong with that.

12
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,174
   To go alongside, we've got
      a green papaya salad

13
00:00:42,176 --> 00:00:44,910
  with a fresh lime vinaigrette
      and toasted pepitas.

14
00:00:44,912 --> 00:00:47,379
      Just like you'd find
    at your local Thai place.

15
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:49,081
 And don't think I've forgotten
         about the rice.

16
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:50,649
       I'm making coconut
          jasmine rice.

17
00:00:50,651 --> 00:00:52,418
       Fragrant and topped
          with toasted

18
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,386
        coconut flakes --
      the family loves it.

19
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:55,587
  All right, let's get started.

20
00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:58,190
Um, let me introduce
   the best chef.

21
00:00:58,192 --> 00:01:00,793
One of my favorites in
the whole world, Chef Aaron May.

22
00:01:00,795 --> 00:01:03,162
 Aaron and I met on
"Triple D" years ago.

23
00:01:03,164 --> 00:01:04,563
   I think it was
    30 years ago.

24
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:06,031
           -At least.
     -At least 30 years ago.

25
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:07,299
    And this guy,
I'm not kidding you,

26
00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:09,401
if I put a challenge
in front of him of something

27
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:11,670
that he's never cooked,
the man can figure it out.

28
00:01:11,672 --> 00:01:13,372
So he's up visiting,
      and when

29
00:01:13,374 --> 00:01:15,174
you're doing something
like this Thai food,

30
00:01:15,176 --> 00:01:17,476
you've got a lot of ingredients,
you got a lot going on.

31
00:01:17,478 --> 00:01:19,812
So, of course, I need all
 the help I can get.

32
00:01:19,814 --> 00:01:21,613
        Aaron May is one
      of my favorite chefs.

33
00:01:21,615 --> 00:01:24,249
     He's just such a great
       energy about food.

34
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:25,651
       And loves to cook.

35
00:01:25,653 --> 00:01:27,853
     You know what he loves
           is he loves

36
00:01:27,855 --> 00:01:29,321
        to talk about it.

37
00:01:29,323 --> 00:01:32,391
    He teaches what he knows
 and he learns what he doesn't.

38
00:01:32,393 --> 00:01:33,892
       And whenever you're
          collaborating

39
00:01:33,894 --> 00:01:36,328
    with somebody like that,
   that has such an open mind

40
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:38,097
      and an open palette,
          it's just --

41
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:39,465
        that's the best.

42
00:01:39,467 --> 00:01:42,868
     So we're talking about
  making this, uh, this curry.

43
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,770
        And I've got some
      peppers broken down.

44
00:01:44,772 --> 00:01:46,371
       Aaron's working on
         some shallots.

45
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:48,574
     We've got a whole list
  of ingredients going in here.

46
00:01:48,576 --> 00:01:50,642
 So just kind of follow with me
         and keep track

47
00:01:50,644 --> 00:01:53,278
   because I sometimes forget
      a couple of the keys.

48
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,848
   The first order of business

49
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:57,850
   is to make the curry paste.

50
00:01:57,852 --> 00:02:01,253
    So we start with Fresnos,
       then some shallots,

51
00:02:01,255 --> 00:02:02,788
        then some garlic,

52
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:07,259
    a little salt and pepper,
    and a little lemongrass.

53
00:02:07,261 --> 00:02:11,930
    Some coriander and cumin,
        then some ginger,

54
00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:14,166
a little cilantro with the stem.

55
00:02:14,168 --> 00:02:16,401
   Then a Sri Lanka lime leaf.

56
00:02:16,403 --> 00:02:17,736
        If you don't have
      this leaf, it's okay.

57
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:19,004
 It's not the end of the world,

58
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:21,240
    but it really does impart
        a lot of flavor.

59
00:02:21,242 --> 00:02:24,710
     And people used to call
    these, uh, Kaffir limes.

60
00:02:24,712 --> 00:02:26,345
So we'll break that up in there.

61
00:02:26,347 --> 00:02:27,980
     A little shrimp paste.

62
00:02:27,982 --> 00:02:29,448
  If you don't have
the shrimp paste, Aaron,

63
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:30,916
what would you like to use?
If you didn't have shrimp paste?

64
00:02:30,918 --> 00:02:33,152
   You know, an anchovy might be
   a great replacement for that.

65
00:02:33,154 --> 00:02:34,653
           You're really looking
              for that seafood,

66
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:35,954
             that fishy flavor.

67
00:02:35,956 --> 00:02:37,823
But a lot of that umami
is coming through this.

68
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:39,725
So when you're talking
about making a really nice

69
00:02:39,727 --> 00:02:41,026
 traditional curry,

70
00:02:41,028 --> 00:02:42,728
 Thai curry, this is
 gonna be a good --

71
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,129
  this is gonna be
a good start for you.

72
00:02:44,131 --> 00:02:45,364
  Uh, but I agree.

73
00:02:45,366 --> 00:02:48,834
But you want that umami.
You want that punch.

74
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:50,769
That that seafood-y base.

75
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:52,371
          Pulse that in
       the food processor,

76
00:02:52,373 --> 00:02:55,240
         break it down,
     still a little texture.

77
00:02:55,242 --> 00:02:57,442
            Awesome.
    Cook that off in the pan.

78
00:03:01,382 --> 00:03:04,016
         Lots of flavor
      coming through that.

79
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:06,885
   Pull it out. Now the pan is
       nice and seasoned.

80
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:09,021
   Going with some thin strips
       of some flank steak

81
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:10,656
       that were seasoned
    with just a little salt.

82
00:03:10,658 --> 00:03:12,658
            Spot on.

83
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,627
Pan's hot, it's well-seasoned.
Start dropping that in batches.

84
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:16,728
                    Yes.

85
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,230
 A little bit of oil
  in there for you.

86
00:03:18,232 --> 00:03:20,265
   Yes. Yes, Chef.
        Okay.

87
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:21,934
      Now let's talk about
        this vinaigrette

88
00:03:21,936 --> 00:03:24,002
      that we're gonna put
  together for this awesome --

89
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:27,673
  and when I say awesome salad,
      wait till you try it.

90
00:03:27,675 --> 00:03:30,909
       Any time that I see
  green papaya salad on a menu,

91
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:32,311
         I'll order it.

92
00:03:32,313 --> 00:03:35,380
     And it's really because
         there's some --

93
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:36,582
          Oh, my mouth
      just starts to water

94
00:03:36,584 --> 00:03:38,450
       as soon as I start
        talking about it.

95
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:42,254
    It's got to be something
       with the fish sauce

96
00:03:42,256 --> 00:03:46,758
      and the crunchy flesh
 of the green papaya, the fruit.

97
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,895
      The sweet, the tart,
      the crunch, the acid.

98
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:51,330
   So the papaya vinaigrette,

99
00:03:51,332 --> 00:03:52,731
     that's the first thing
      we start it off with.

100
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:55,500
       A little lime zest.

101
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:56,969
  Let me get this one, as well.

102
00:03:56,971 --> 00:03:58,937
         Now, first time
    I had green papaya salad,

103
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:01,073
      I will tell you this,
        I was a little --

104
00:04:01,075 --> 00:04:02,507
    I was a little surprised.

105
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:04,443
   I mean, this was years ago,
       maybe 15 years ago.

106
00:04:04,445 --> 00:04:06,178
      But I'm sitting there
     eating it and I'm like,

107
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,013
      "What is this crunch?
      Where is this noodle?

108
00:04:08,015 --> 00:04:09,448
     I've never seen this."

109
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,183
    I think I might have had
   a little bit too much beer.

110
00:04:11,185 --> 00:04:15,320
         But it had such
    phenomenal flavor to it.

111
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:16,989
     And I couldn't believe
      what the texture was.

112
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:19,258
        And it's all from
      this unripened fruit.

113
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,527
  Right behind you.

114
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:24,363
                There you go.

115
00:04:24,365 --> 00:04:26,632
              Okay.
         So lime juice.

116
00:04:30,271 --> 00:04:31,870
        See how we didn't
       put a bunch of meat

117
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:34,039
   in this pan and we just put
     a little bit in there.

118
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:36,074
    What we're trying to do,
  there's a lot of fat in that.

119
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:37,376
       A lot of moisture.
     And I want to make sure

120
00:04:37,378 --> 00:04:39,111
     that we don't sit there
     and just boil the meat.

121
00:04:39,113 --> 00:04:42,047
        That's why I also
       took the paste out.

122
00:04:42,049 --> 00:04:43,849
So, Aaron, you want to move that
around a little bit for me?

123
00:04:43,851 --> 00:04:45,284
   I want to build
 some crust on that.

124
00:04:45,286 --> 00:04:47,853
              -Yep.
      -Okay. So lime juice.

125
00:04:53,594 --> 00:04:55,727
        Little olive oil,

126
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:57,663
   a little rice wine vinegar.

127
00:04:57,665 --> 00:04:59,931
 So again, just kind of your --

128
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:01,333
            you know,
     your Asian vinaigrette.

129
00:05:01,335 --> 00:05:02,668
         Kind of simple.
       This one is the --

130
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,202
           is the key,
       is a little mirin.

131
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:06,772
        Lower in alcohol,
        higher in sugar.

132
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:10,909
       Little fish sauce.

133
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:12,311
      Remember, always keep
  the fish sauce in the fridge.

134
00:05:12,313 --> 00:05:14,780
You have a fish sauce
 you love the best?

135
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:16,014
          I don't to be quite --
                    I --

136
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:17,449
           I mean, you're really
        looking for that flavor,

137
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:18,984
    like you were talking about,
                 that umami,

138
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:22,421
        that kind of earthiness,
        that sixth flavor sense.

139
00:05:22,423 --> 00:05:26,892
  I'll add a little bit of this
  sesame oil and a little soy.

140
00:05:26,894 --> 00:05:30,395
         And that should
         round this out.

141
00:05:30,397 --> 00:05:32,497
     The key though, to me,
         with fish sauce

142
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:34,533
 is you got to watch out because
    they're not all the same.

143
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:37,002
   And some are pretty gnarly
   and they get pretty strong

144
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:39,938
and they can sabotage your dish.

145
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,773
        Okay, some sugar.

146
00:05:41,775 --> 00:05:43,542
       Vinaigrette's done,
      working on the meat.

147
00:05:43,544 --> 00:05:46,078
          The red chili
       Thai paste is done.

148
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,380
  We got to prep some veggies,
 we're putting salads together.

149
00:05:48,382 --> 00:05:49,581
        Hanging out with
        my favorite chef

150
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:50,982
  in the world, Chef Aaron May.

151
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:52,317
          We'll see you
        in a little bit.

152
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:53,952
      That got
  fast and furious.

153
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:56,388
             -Quick.
     -Right out of control.

154
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:06,865
         Welcome back to
        "Guy's Big Bite."

155
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:08,233
        Hanging out with
         Chef Aaron May.

156
00:06:08,235 --> 00:06:10,669
 Talking about great Thai food.

157
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:12,170
        Now, Aaron and I
     have experienced great

158
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:14,172
      Thai food all around
          the country.

159
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:15,507
      Uh, but when we're up
          at the ranch,

160
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:16,908
 there is no Thai food delivery.

161
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,810
    So we do what we do best.

162
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:20,112
   And that's get into cooking

163
00:06:20,114 --> 00:06:21,680
      and making everything
         under the sun.

164
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:23,181
     And that's what happens
       here at the ranch.

165
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:24,883
       So we made our own
      Thai paste over here

166
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:27,119
    with some Fresno chilies
       and some lemongrass

167
00:06:27,121 --> 00:06:28,920
         and some ginger
     and some garlic and --

168
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:30,655
       Well, you name it,
    everybody's in the pool.

169
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:33,225
    Seared that off, now I'm
   getting the pan super hot.

170
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:37,229
       And we're dropping
        down some onions.

171
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:39,030
         Aaron's working
        the bell peppers.

172
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:41,032
       And, uh, I want you
       to show me this --

173
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:43,034
       Everybody has a way
  they cut bell peppers, okay.

174
00:06:43,036 --> 00:06:45,937
   Fleshing it off the sides,
         rolling it out.

175
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:47,272
   Sometimes you'll see a chef

176
00:06:47,274 --> 00:06:48,573
         cut off the top
  and the end and roll through.

177
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,875
    Show me your
little method again?

178
00:06:49,877 --> 00:06:52,544
           I like to cut the top
    and the bottom and, exactly,

179
00:06:52,546 --> 00:06:53,979
               I just kind of
                roll it out.

180
00:06:53,981 --> 00:07:00,452
          Taking all those seeds
             and spines at once.

181
00:07:00,454 --> 00:07:02,287
               And it gives me
      a nice, clean pepper here.

182
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:03,755
    Look at that.
And now you've cleaned it out.

183
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:05,624
 So if you're really
getting fancy with it,

184
00:07:05,626 --> 00:07:07,225
how he took all the insides
     out of it,

185
00:07:07,227 --> 00:07:08,560
now you're really getting
 some really nice --

186
00:07:08,562 --> 00:07:11,329
If you were making a,
uh, a little crudité platter

187
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:13,732
it would be fantastic.
   Nice and thin.

188
00:07:13,734 --> 00:07:15,667
Oh, you're so magical.
        Okay.

189
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:17,369
         So I'm cooking
        the onions down.

190
00:07:17,371 --> 00:07:19,004
    We're using flank steak.

191
00:07:19,006 --> 00:07:20,772
        We cut the flank
     steak down, Aaron did.

192
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:23,575
 We salted a little bit and then
  put a really nice sear on it.

193
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:25,744
      See that little crust
     that we tried to build?

194
00:07:25,746 --> 00:07:28,013
       Had all the flavor
      leftover in the pan.

195
00:07:28,015 --> 00:07:31,049
     Now we'll drop the, uh,
     peppers and onions in.

196
00:07:31,051 --> 00:07:33,151
      I didn't want to drop
        the, uh, peppers

197
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:34,619
 and onions on top of the steak

198
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,588
    because all that moisture
   of the peppers and onions,

199
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,723
      when they cook down,
 just kind of wilt a little bit.

200
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:39,958
      They'll kind of take
       some of that crunch

201
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:44,429
   and that crust off of that.
          So in you go.

202
00:07:44,431 --> 00:07:46,731
Chef, uh, I got another
 great task for you.

203
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:48,233
- Yeah.
 -Green beans.

204
00:07:48,235 --> 00:07:49,534
            -Hey now.
          -There we go.

205
00:07:49,536 --> 00:07:51,269
     So we're gonna blister
        some green beans

206
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:53,939
   going into this fantastic,
     uh, green papaya salad.

207
00:07:53,941 --> 00:07:56,074
     which we'll talk about
          in a second.

208
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:58,643
          Look at that.
 That's the look that you want.

209
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:01,546
      Nice sweated peppers.
      Not gonna go too far.

210
00:08:01,548 --> 00:08:02,981
        Excuse me, buddy.

211
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:05,016
   Let me grab the can opener.

212
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:07,786
          Coconut milk.
         Now, coconut --

213
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:09,287
     Do you work
with coconut milk a lot?

214
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:10,455
            I love coconut milk.

215
00:08:10,457 --> 00:08:12,958
          I mean, as a non-dairy
                 substitute.

216
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,759
         You can thicken things,
       you can make them creamy.

217
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:16,828
              But you still get
        that non-dairy goodness.

218
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,129
                 I love it.

219
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:20,899
  This is also kind of deglaze
      the pan a little bit.

220
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:23,735
   Now, Aaron, I've got a, uh,
        cast-iron skillet

221
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:26,438
     that is starting to get
      super hot right here.

222
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,373
      And we're just gonna
        blister those up,

223
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,375
     put some color to 'em,
         put some char.

224
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:34,379
  This salad, this -- this, uh,
    um, green papaya salad --

225
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:36,047
        you have to have
  a green papaya by the way --

226
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:37,883
        is so fantastic.

227
00:08:37,885 --> 00:08:40,151
  But it's kind of -- sometimes
     gets a little one note.

228
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:41,453
        Because it's all
     a bunch of raw veggies.

229
00:08:41,455 --> 00:08:43,154
    By taking these veggies,
     we're still gonna leave

230
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:44,422
     the green beans crispy,

231
00:08:44,424 --> 00:08:45,757
        but they're gonna
      have that nice char.

232
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:47,626
   They're gonna bring in that
      cooked element to it

233
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:49,628
         without having
       the cooked texture.

234
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,762
You know what I'm saying?

235
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:52,731
            That depth of flavor
         you get from that char,

236
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:54,833
              that bitterness,
               as a contrast,

237
00:08:54,835 --> 00:08:56,434
                is one of my
              favorite things.

238
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:57,602
          So just think
        of all the flavor

239
00:08:57,604 --> 00:08:59,070
       that we've already
       started to develop.

240
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:01,039
  We got all the fat coming off
        that flank steak.

241
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,774
    We had some of the paste
     that was left in there.

242
00:09:02,776 --> 00:09:05,277
       We'll add some more
       paste in right now.

243
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,978
 And this where I kind of get --

244
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,713
          this is where
     I kind of take it easy.

245
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,549
       I want to just see
       how this develops.

246
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:12,551
    Remember, you're working
       with fresh veggies.

247
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:15,787
        So if it gets --
   you get too much in there,

248
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:17,389
 you know, each one is gonna be
     a little bit different.

249
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:18,690
  You got to taste it yourself.

250
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:21,760
      So we'll stir this in
     and see where we're at.

251
00:09:21,762 --> 00:09:24,563
    Not that faux red color.
  I mean, a lot of times you --

252
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:26,965
Oh, it's getting some
pretty nice orange though.

253
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:28,199
             It looks beautiful.

254
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:29,634
But you know sometimes
you get those pastes

255
00:09:29,636 --> 00:09:31,036
and they're just so vibrant
  and you're like,

256
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:33,104
"Come on. What vegetable
did you use to get that color?"

257
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:35,340
I'm gonna give this a quick
little taste. How we looking?

258
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:36,975
Boy, you work with --

259
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:38,977
                Ready to go.

260
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:40,912
You work with purpose,
     my friend.

261
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,847
I'm gonna add a little touch
 of salt into that.

262
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:44,316
     All right.
     Now, Aaron,

263
00:09:44,318 --> 00:09:46,184
pan is hot and I gave it
a little bit of oil.

264
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:49,220
 If you just want to
   babysit those.

265
00:09:49,222 --> 00:09:51,556
This is cooking down,
blistering the beans.

266
00:09:51,558 --> 00:09:52,757
         Everything looks great.

267
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,826
 Okay, green papaya,
what do you know about it?

268
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:58,964
     I know it's one of the most
widely eaten fruits in the world

269
00:09:58,966 --> 00:10:01,132
      because of the consumption
               level in Asia.

270
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:02,734
  Where did you get
  this information?

271
00:10:02,736 --> 00:10:05,770
                   I mean,
       it came to me in a dream.

272
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:08,206
I don't know if he's --
I mean, he knows everything.

273
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:09,741
     -I'm telling the truth.
             -Okay.

274
00:10:09,743 --> 00:10:11,743
     -I'm telling the truth.
    -All right. I don't know.

275
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:13,778
  That sounded way
  too easy for you.

276
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,180
  We're gonna grab
 this green papaya.

277
00:10:15,182 --> 00:10:16,581
Now, when I go to, uh,

278
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:17,916
 some of my favorite
 Asian restaurants,

279
00:10:17,918 --> 00:10:20,652
 I'll see them take
this papaya, trim it down,

280
00:10:20,654 --> 00:10:22,988
just taking a little bit
  of the skin off.

281
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:27,258
        Okay.
Now this one is just getting

282
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,594
on the verge of not working.

283
00:10:29,596 --> 00:10:31,863
Because you can see how the
flesh is turning a little bit,

284
00:10:31,865 --> 00:10:35,133
      uh, how it's turning
a little beige, a little orange.

285
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,035
       You'd like it to be
  really nice and crisp white.

286
00:10:37,037 --> 00:10:40,705
      But I can feel how --
   I can feel how firm it is.

287
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:42,040
     So it'll probably work.

288
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:43,875
          Now, this is
       how I see 'em do it

289
00:10:43,877 --> 00:10:45,644
     at my favorite market.
       They go like this.

290
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:47,746
     And you'll see the lady
     sitting right there --

291
00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:49,748
     or the guy, whomever --
       sitting right there

292
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,850
and then just kind of hitting it

293
00:10:51,852 --> 00:10:53,885
        and just lightly
        tapping it, okay?

294
00:10:53,887 --> 00:10:57,389
      Now, they'll take it
      right to themselves.

295
00:10:57,391 --> 00:10:59,124
        I'll just do this
      to kind of show you.

296
00:10:59,126 --> 00:11:01,660
 They'll just take it and carve
     it right to themselves,

297
00:11:01,662 --> 00:11:03,528
      just carve this off.

298
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:07,098
    And what we get are these
 really nice fantastic strands.

299
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,267
              Okay?
     That takes a long time.

300
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:11,870
  So the way we're gonna do it

301
00:11:11,872 --> 00:11:13,104
    is we're gonna bring out

302
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:16,041
     this cool little slicer
      that we found online.

303
00:11:16,043 --> 00:11:20,645
    Kind of like a mandoline
     with some teeth in it.

304
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:24,115
     So take the base of so
    it's easier to work with.

305
00:11:24,117 --> 00:11:26,284
          Drag it down.

306
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:29,020
      And you see how this
       is just building us

307
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:32,724
      these perfect strands
     of this nice, crunchy,

308
00:11:32,726 --> 00:11:34,793
          green papaya.
              Huh?

309
00:11:34,795 --> 00:11:36,594
              Okay.
    So we got papayas to do,

310
00:11:36,596 --> 00:11:38,797
   green beans are scorching,
    cooking that sauce down.

311
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:40,465
     Give it a little taste,
      make sure we're good.

312
00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:41,966
      The beef is finished.
          Come on back,

313
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:43,301
hanging out with Chef Aaron May.

314
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:44,969
 Making Thai food at the ranch.
        See you in a bit.

315
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:46,337
        You want to work
         on this or me?

316
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:55,013
          Welcome back.
   So here's what we're doing.

317
00:11:55,015 --> 00:11:56,481
     We're making fantastic
           Thai food.

318
00:11:56,483 --> 00:11:57,749
 We're up at the ranch and Aaron

319
00:11:57,751 --> 00:11:59,050
   and I like to get together

320
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,052
    and make things that you
     typically wouldn't make

321
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:02,721
       when you're cooking
     in an outdoor kitchen.

322
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:03,855
         So we're making
           Thai food.

323
00:12:03,857 --> 00:12:06,357
        We made some red
        Thai curry paste.

324
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:08,193
        Um, with some --
      with some lemongrass

325
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:10,095
  and all kinds of great stuff
      and ginger and garlic

326
00:12:10,097 --> 00:12:12,063
        and all the cast
         of characters.

327
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,732
      And now we're putting
        together a salad,

328
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:14,999
  we're gonna toast some rice,

329
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:16,401
       we're making rice,
        the whole thing.

330
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:19,104
    I've got a screaming-hot
       cast-iron skillet.

331
00:12:19,106 --> 00:12:22,440
I want to blister a few tomatoes
  for this green papaya salad.

332
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:24,843
         And, uh, well,
      that's all she wrote.

333
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:28,313
              Okay.
       Few tomatoes down.

334
00:12:28,315 --> 00:12:29,514
          Need to toast
      a little bit of rice.

335
00:12:29,516 --> 00:12:30,782
         We're gonna put
      a little toasted rice

336
00:12:30,784 --> 00:12:34,252
          on top of it
   for a little funky crunch.

337
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,754
     And I also need to get
        the rice started.

338
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:38,089
     And I'm gonna do a rice
     with some coconut milk.

339
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:41,493
 So, um, to go along with this.

340
00:12:41,495 --> 00:12:42,827
  A little jasmine rice there.

341
00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:44,362
Keep an eye on that,
  would you, Chef?

342
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:45,697
                 Yeah, Chef.

343
00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:49,067
     The key here is to use
 a really good long-grain rice.

344
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:51,436
    It's a supporting player,
  but it has to be done right.

345
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:53,838
 Three cups of the jasmine rice.

346
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:57,175
 I'm gonna rinse it real quick.

347
00:12:57,177 --> 00:13:00,445
         Drop that down.

348
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:02,046
            The rice,
     pretty straightforward.

349
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:05,483
      A little coconut milk
         and some water.

350
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:09,320
        Just about 2 cups
        of coconut milk.

351
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:12,724
       Three and a quarter
         cups of water.

352
00:13:12,726 --> 00:13:15,860
      Start to simmer that.
              Okay.

353
00:13:15,862 --> 00:13:17,996
       Everybody's dropped
     in the pool over there.

354
00:13:17,998 --> 00:13:19,697
Okay, where are we at?
I'm gonna start giving --

355
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:21,399
       Bell pepper and cucumber.

356
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:23,468
 -Let me give you some tomatoes.
            -Perfect.

357
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,903
   Start giving me
a little chop on that.

358
00:13:24,905 --> 00:13:27,505
     I also got to toast up
          some pepitas.

359
00:13:27,507 --> 00:13:29,274
        And I got to add
          a little bit

360
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:30,809
        of chicken stock
     over here in my curry.

361
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:32,110
        So I didn't talk
        about the curry.

362
00:13:32,112 --> 00:13:35,346
     So we made this awesome
   curry with the lemongrass.

363
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:38,216
 And we had the Fresno chilies,
    a lot of Fresno chilies,

364
00:13:38,218 --> 00:13:40,018
        and some garlic.
       Made our own paste.

365
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,820
       And the great thing
  is that I didn't use it all.

366
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:43,188
    So I have some in reserve

367
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:45,156
   if I don't want to make it
     too spicy or if the --

368
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:46,991
       if the paste itself
        is really strong.

369
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:49,594
        Add a little bit
    of chicken stock to that.

370
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:55,533
    Gonna thin it out a bit.
  And I took this flank steak,

371
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:58,436
     or Aaron took the flank
   steak a the very beginning.

372
00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:00,605
          There we go.
   Just to thin it out a bit.

373
00:14:00,607 --> 00:14:02,473
      Took the flank steak
      at the very beginning

374
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:03,741
     and, uh, seared it off.

375
00:14:03,743 --> 00:14:05,276
        So it's got some
       nice texture to it.

376
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:06,377
   And then we're just slowly

377
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:08,913
       letting this sauce
         come together.

378
00:14:08,915 --> 00:14:10,782
     Really building flavors
   with the green bell pepper

379
00:14:10,784 --> 00:14:14,152
 and the red bell pepper inside.
              Okay.

380
00:14:14,154 --> 00:14:15,687
        And then also hit
    some coconut milk in it.

381
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:17,789
        Let me give this
         a little taste.

382
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,962
          Oh, brother.
     That's coming together.

383
00:14:23,964 --> 00:14:26,231
         That is coming
       together big time.

384
00:14:26,233 --> 00:14:28,533
          I'm not gonna
       feed you the taste.

385
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:31,769
 You can get after it yourself.
   You tell me if that has --

386
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:33,571
     doesn't have some real
      depth of Thai flavor.

387
00:14:33,573 --> 00:14:35,039
              -Wow.
              -Huh?

388
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,342
                   I mean,
   as good as anything anywhere.

389
00:14:37,344 --> 00:14:40,011
 As good as anything
      anywhere.

390
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:43,147
Good coconut wholesomeness.
What'd you call it last time?

391
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:44,649
      -Non-dairy goodness.
      -Non-dairy goodness.

392
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:45,950
       Really making that shine.
                  I mean --

393
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:48,052
    Aaron always
has a one-liner. Okay.

394
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:51,155
     The earthiness the currin--
       I mean, that's beautiful.

395
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:52,924
   The earthiness
 and the curriness.

396
00:14:52,926 --> 00:14:54,225
        -I love 'em both.
             -Okay.

397
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:56,561
    So see that toasted rice?
     Still a little bit hot.

398
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:57,996
  Wow, that's a lot a bit hot.

399
00:14:57,998 --> 00:14:59,264
         Um, but this is
         gonna be great.

400
00:14:59,266 --> 00:15:02,734
       Nice little crunchy
    texture into this salad.

401
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:04,369
         We toasted some
       of the jasmine rice

402
00:15:04,371 --> 00:15:05,837
      that we were cooking
      for the coconut rice,

403
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,973
 took that, hit that in a spice
    blender, zipped that up.

404
00:15:08,975 --> 00:15:10,875
    Adding the little crunch,
         that little --

405
00:15:10,877 --> 00:15:13,478
    that little bit of extra
      on the outside of it

406
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,213
  just took it to a new level.

407
00:15:15,215 --> 00:15:16,814
 Where you at, Chef?
Are you ready to go?

408
00:15:16,816 --> 00:15:19,817
   Yeah. I got these green beans
        on the angle right here.

409
00:15:19,819 --> 00:15:21,586
               And we're ready
             for you over here.

410
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:24,656
Mixing up the dressing.
        Okay.

411
00:15:24,658 --> 00:15:28,159
   So you've got the peppers,
    we've got some cucumbers.

412
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:31,796
We've got the, uh, green papaya,
         some scallions,

413
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:34,365
     the blistered tomatoes,
   everybody coming together.

414
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:37,101
And then the fish sauce, the soy
   sauce, everybody's in this.

415
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:39,804
     I mean, this is really
      bringing big flavor.

416
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:41,306
         And then I got
      a little bit of this

417
00:15:41,308 --> 00:15:42,573
      that we'll top it off
        right at the end.

418
00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:44,642
          A little bit
      of this toasted rice.

419
00:15:44,644 --> 00:15:46,210
   Um, last thing I got to do,

420
00:15:46,212 --> 00:15:48,012
       toast the pepitas,
         drop those in.

421
00:15:48,014 --> 00:15:49,981
        Rice is working,
        beef'll go back.

422
00:15:49,983 --> 00:15:51,516
        Huh?

423
00:15:51,518 --> 00:15:53,551
  -This is gonna be delicious.
  -This<i> is</i> gonna be delicious.

424
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:55,286
We'll see you in a minute.
We'll put it all together.

425
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:56,888
              Mm, that's good.

426
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:58,289
   I want to try.

427
00:16:08,368 --> 00:16:09,767
         Welcome back to
        "Guy's Big Bite."

428
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:12,203
   Toasted pepitas going into
       this outrageous --

429
00:16:12,205 --> 00:16:13,671
 Don't hog it over here, buddy.

430
00:16:13,673 --> 00:16:16,107
      This outrageous green
          papaya salad.

431
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:17,909
    Chef May is in the house.

432
00:16:17,911 --> 00:16:20,411
      Toasted pepitas right
       on top, my friend.

433
00:16:20,413 --> 00:16:22,714
   We blistered some tomatoes
      and some green beans.

434
00:16:22,716 --> 00:16:24,582
     We've got green papaya
       we've sliced thin.

435
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:25,850
      We made the dressing,

436
00:16:25,852 --> 00:16:28,019
       it's got everything
    from fish sauce to mirin

437
00:16:28,021 --> 00:16:30,021
      to rice wine vinegar,
          you name it.

438
00:16:30,023 --> 00:16:31,656
       Uh, some Thai basil

439
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:33,858
  and some mint going in here.

440
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,126
        Some mung beans.

441
00:16:35,128 --> 00:16:38,129
           This salad,
      in itself, is enough.

442
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:41,733
 Crunchy goodness, Asian flavor,
        depth of flavor,

443
00:16:41,735 --> 00:16:43,368
        a little charred
       tomatoes, as well.

444
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:47,038
Then we made a red curry, which,
  actually, I want to try this.

445
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,042
         'Cause I added
     a little bit of curry.

446
00:16:51,044 --> 00:16:53,177
           I like it.
I'm gonna add just a touch more.

447
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,713
It's just Aaron and I right now.
    We can handle the spice.

448
00:16:55,715 --> 00:16:57,248
   This has got Fresno chili.

449
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,250
     It's a red curry paste
     made with Fresno chili

450
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:02,687
    and lemongrass and garlic
 and lime and, uh, you name it.

451
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:04,088
       And do you want to
      talk about beautiful?

452
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:05,790
   And this little bit extra,
     it'll hold for at least

453
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:07,525
         a week or two.

454
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:10,128
              Okay.
          Stir that in.

455
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:12,830
       We also have the --
  the, uh, toasted coconut here

456
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:14,298
          for some rice
          that we made,

457
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:18,336
     a little coconut milk,
       some jasmine rice.

458
00:17:18,338 --> 00:17:20,104
      Do you got some mint
         and Thai basil

459
00:17:20,106 --> 00:17:21,906
     coming for me, brother?
    -I do. You ready for it?

460
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:24,742
So we took some flank steak --
took some flank steak,

461
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:26,778
sliced it really thin,
gave it a little salt,

462
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,613
seared it in the pan,
   pulled it out.

463
00:17:28,615 --> 00:17:30,681
Then hit some peppers
 and onions in here.

464
00:17:30,683 --> 00:17:32,083
  Put a little more
   heat on there.

465
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:34,519
So I need about a quarter --
uh, give me a little mint

466
00:17:34,521 --> 00:17:37,355
and a little Thai basil
     right here.

467
00:17:37,357 --> 00:17:39,590
     I will get
some cilantro working.

468
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:41,025
         -Right in here?
         -Yeah. Drop it.

469
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:42,360
  We added a little Thai basil,

470
00:17:42,362 --> 00:17:45,463
      a little bit of mint,
    a little bit of cilantro.

471
00:17:45,465 --> 00:17:47,832
Stirred that in right at the end

472
00:17:47,834 --> 00:17:50,134
  so they just really just kind
     of bloom in the sauce.

473
00:17:50,136 --> 00:17:51,202
            Awesome.

474
00:17:51,204 --> 00:17:54,405
            Cilantro
    and Thai basil really --

475
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,107
         I mean, they --
  they take a big lead in this.

476
00:17:56,109 --> 00:17:57,475
      People always want to
      think about cilantro

477
00:17:57,477 --> 00:17:58,776
   being just in Mexican food.

478
00:17:58,778 --> 00:18:00,711
      But these fresh herbs
        right now on top

479
00:18:00,713 --> 00:18:03,214
        of this big rich
        Thai curry paste.

480
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:07,151
      A little bit of lime.

481
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:09,120
Where you at, buddy?
   In good shape?

482
00:18:09,122 --> 00:18:11,656
             This is -- I mean,
  I can't wait to dig into this.

483
00:18:11,658 --> 00:18:13,257
All right, let me get --
I got a couple plates.

484
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:15,560
  Let me hand them
 off to you, my man.

485
00:18:15,562 --> 00:18:18,496
 Let me drop these.

486
00:18:18,498 --> 00:18:20,298
     Hit us with
  a couple salads.

487
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,899
             -Yeah.
         -There you go.

488
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:25,536
    All right, you got that.

489
00:18:25,538 --> 00:18:27,171
       Little bit of lime
         juice in here.

490
00:18:27,173 --> 00:18:28,539
          Now stirring
      in those fresh herbs.

491
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,541
           Fresh herbs
        right at the end.

492
00:18:34,047 --> 00:18:37,281
        Excuse me, let me
     reach right over here.

493
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:39,450
              Okay.

494
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:41,853
         Let me give you
      a little bit of rice.

495
00:18:41,855 --> 00:18:45,623
      Touch of the toasted
         coconut there.

496
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,191
             I mean, the smell.

497
00:18:47,193 --> 00:18:49,327
   Oh, we got a lot of pieces
     that put this together.

498
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:51,796
         This is the --
 This is the finale, right here.

499
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:54,699
        This is a little
      toasted jasmine rice

500
00:18:54,701 --> 00:18:57,835
    that I'm just gonna take
     and throw right on top

501
00:18:57,837 --> 00:18:59,704
      for that little extra
          added crunch

502
00:18:59,706 --> 00:19:02,673
       on top of the, uh,
       green papaya salad.

503
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:04,775
      That's gorgeous, man.
        That is gorgeous.

504
00:19:04,777 --> 00:19:06,244
 Okay, where you at.

505
00:19:06,246 --> 00:19:08,613
  -We're good to go over here.
   -Let me get on here with --

506
00:19:08,615 --> 00:19:10,548
 Here, grab yourself
     some rice.

507
00:19:17,557 --> 00:19:20,224
    There we go,
we'll lay some of that --

508
00:19:20,226 --> 00:19:22,426
lay some of that on top.

509
00:19:25,098 --> 00:19:27,765
A little bit of the --
    Look at that.

510
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:31,202
Oh, pardon that mess
that I just made there.

511
00:19:31,204 --> 00:19:32,503
     Beautiful.

512
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,105
   Trade you off?
Go ahead and jump into it.

513
00:19:34,107 --> 00:19:37,074
     Some forks
right there, brother.

514
00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:39,377
I love that flank steak.
We just seared it off,

515
00:19:39,379 --> 00:19:41,212
     put a nice
little crust to it...

516
00:19:43,283 --> 00:19:45,383
     took it out
 and then let it --

517
00:19:45,385 --> 00:19:48,519
then add it in right here
 at the last minute.

518
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:49,820
                    Wow.

519
00:19:49,822 --> 00:19:52,423
      Big wow?
Like big Aaron May wow?

520
00:19:52,425 --> 00:19:54,091
He's one of my favorite
 chefs in the world.

521
00:19:54,093 --> 00:19:56,861
When I get a big wow
out of him on my recipe...

522
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:59,964
          Man, that's delicious.

523
00:19:59,966 --> 00:20:01,732
         You know, what's great?

524
00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:03,701
                The play off
            that sweet and sour,

525
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:06,270
      the hot and spicy, I mean,
      you're getting everything.

526
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:09,240
              It's unbelievable
          how delicious this is.

527
00:20:09,242 --> 00:20:12,176
         Mm.

528
00:20:12,178 --> 00:20:13,544
                  So good.

529
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:16,948
    The coconut,
   the creaminess,

530
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:21,919
little punch from the Thai --
from the, um, red curry.

531
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:24,555
     But the key
is the refreshing side of it,

532
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:26,290
  when you get into
the green papaya salad,

533
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:29,694
   how it kind of
cleanses the palette.

534
00:20:29,696 --> 00:20:32,163
You might not have had
green papaya salad before.

535
00:20:32,165 --> 00:20:34,265
Matter of fact, this all
might be foreign to you.

536
00:20:34,267 --> 00:20:36,400
      Trust me,
 this is safe enough

537
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:39,904
to roll this out for the family,
surprise 'em, have a great time.

538
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:41,706
Take your time to do it,
 but you'll love it

539
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:45,409
and you'll want leftovers.
Right? You're the best.

540
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:46,844

   Aaron will even
 come over and cook.

544
00:20:51,551 --> 00:20:52,950
                 No problem.

545
00:20:52,952 --> 00:20:54,585
     Not really.
   See you later.

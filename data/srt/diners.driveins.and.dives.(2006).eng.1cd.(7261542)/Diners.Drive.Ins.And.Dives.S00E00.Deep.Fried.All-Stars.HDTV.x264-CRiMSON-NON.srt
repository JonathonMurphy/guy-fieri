1
00:00:00,868 --> 00:00:01,934
Hey, everybody.

2
00:00:01,936 --> 00:00:03,402
I'm Guy Fieri,
  and we're rolling out

3
00:00:03,404 --> 00:00:06,705
looking for America's greatest
 diners, drive-ins, and dives.

4
00:00:06,707 --> 00:00:07,973
This trip...

5
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,808
You guys do have
 a heart-paddle kit here, right?

6
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:11,043
Yes, we do.

7
00:00:11,045 --> 00:00:13,612
...it's a full hour
 of deep-fried all stars.

8
00:00:13,614 --> 00:00:14,947
Drop it like it.
      Eh!

9
00:00:14,949 --> 00:00:16,281
Drop it like it.
      Eh!

10
00:00:16,283 --> 00:00:17,616
On a stick...

11
00:00:17,618 --> 00:00:21,453
Slagious, gelatinous
     maximus.

12
00:00:21,455 --> 00:00:24,223
It's a big-bacon twist
  on the corn dog.

13
00:00:24,225 --> 00:00:26,492
Confit,
pork belly corn dog.

14
00:00:26,494 --> 00:00:27,559
Yes.   Yes.

15
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:28,961
And a lobster tail
  tucked in tempura.

16
00:00:28,963 --> 00:00:30,996
1
Yes. Yes.

17
00:00:30,998 --> 00:00:32,464
In a ball...

18
00:00:32,466 --> 00:00:34,400
What size ball are
you gonna make them into?

19
00:00:34,402 --> 00:00:36,135
Oh.

20
00:00:36,137 --> 00:00:38,137
...with cheesy fried goodness...

21
00:00:38,139 --> 00:00:40,039
Mmm. That's nuts.

22
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:43,942
...and a roundup
 of Cuban and Italian classics.

23
00:00:43,944 --> 00:00:44,843
Ranchera sauce?

24
00:00:44,845 --> 00:00:46,512
Ranchera sauce.
Ranchera sauce.

25
00:00:46,514 --> 00:00:48,480
Its slam-dunk clam cakes...

26
00:00:48,482 --> 00:00:51,917
Hold onto it, Gilligan. We've
got rough seas in a minute.

27
00:00:51,919 --> 00:00:53,752
...real-deal fish-and-chips...

28
00:00:53,754 --> 00:00:55,087
The whole experience
   is coming back.

29
00:00:55,089 --> 00:00:57,222
...a crispy clucker sandwich...

30
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:58,991
That's like a Pink Floyd
 concert, Man.

31
00:00:58,993 --> 00:01:02,661
...and a Philly-fried take
   on the PB&J...

32
00:01:02,663 --> 00:01:05,497
Oh, man. Right?
How bad can that be?

33
00:01:05,499 --> 00:01:08,167
...and a take
  on the childhood fave.

34
00:01:08,169 --> 00:01:10,436
Are you guys excited
     at home?

35
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:12,838
Plus...
  real-deal chicharrones.

36
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,707
Got some raw pigskins.
    That's a little
 "Silence of the Lamb"-y for me.

37
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:18,744
It's all scary-good,
  deep-fried food.

38
00:01:18,746 --> 00:01:20,746
Do we look like we're on
  some health tour?

39
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:23,749
Look at us.
   Come on.
 Let's go jump some buildings.

40
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:25,784
That's all right here, right now

41
00:01:25,786 --> 00:01:28,654
on "Diners, Drive-Ins
   and Dives."

44
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:44,603
Okay.
 I'm here on Cambridge Street,

45
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:47,206
Cambridge, Mass, right between
  M.I.T. and Harvard --

46
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:48,574
almost right in the middle.

47
00:01:48,576 --> 00:01:51,143
I'm going to a joint that's
 got a funny, little story.

48
00:01:51,145 --> 00:01:53,312
So, it's a Cajun place
  for like 20, 25 years.

49
00:01:53,314 --> 00:01:55,380
Then all of a sudden,
  they decide to sell,

50
00:01:55,382 --> 00:01:57,449
and it's gonna become
  a Chinese restaurant,

51
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:59,618
except one of the neighbors
  that owns a bakery

52
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,919
doesn't want that to happen,

53
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:01,954
so she buys the joint

54
00:02:01,956 --> 00:02:03,789
and hires this crazy chef.

55
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:06,792
And what do they name the place?
 After the birthplace of Elvis.

56
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:09,194
It's a story you hear every day.
   This is Tupelo.

57
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:12,097
Catfish going down.

58
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:13,932
Don't tell anybody
  about this place

59
00:02:13,934 --> 00:02:15,968
because we want to keep it
   to ourselves.

60
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:19,338
You do not see a lot of Southern
 restaurants around here.

61
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:22,508
This is, like, a beacon of light
  in the darkness.

62
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:25,978
From owner Renee McLeod's
  light-bulb idea...

63
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,480
You say, "No, we're not
gonna let it become
a Chinese restaurant.

64
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:29,581
We're gonna build our own..."

65
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:32,151
New Orleans, Southern --
 Funky joint?

66
00:02:32,153 --> 00:02:33,318
Funky joint. Yes.

67
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,255
...that gets its groove
 from Chef Rembs Layman,

68
00:02:36,257 --> 00:02:37,523
a true character,

69
00:02:37,525 --> 00:02:40,192
that was raised on his mom's
 Crescent City cooking...

70
00:02:40,194 --> 00:02:41,460
Shrimp and grits.

71
00:02:41,462 --> 00:02:43,829
...but who brings his own kind
 of style to the party.

72
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:45,998
There's a "Z"
    in your head.
That's my flair.

73
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,299
Always been doing it?
  No.

74
00:02:47,301 --> 00:02:48,901
'Cause you were coming.
    Oh, I love that.

75
00:02:48,903 --> 00:02:50,135
I needed flair.

76
00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:52,971
Way to put something on
   extra, you know...hey.

77
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:55,140
But he's putting that flair
   into the gumbo,

78
00:02:55,142 --> 00:02:57,109
the beer-battered crepes...

79
00:02:57,111 --> 00:02:58,710
You can't miss that
    right there.

80
00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:01,413
...and his zigzag take on bacon

81
00:03:01,415 --> 00:03:04,683
that literally made me do
   a double take.

82
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,652
Confit,
pork belly corn dog.

83
00:03:06,654 --> 00:03:08,921
Confit,
   pork belly corn dog.

84
00:03:08,923 --> 00:03:11,156
Confit,
pork belly corn dog.

85
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:12,291
Yes.   Yes.

86
00:03:12,293 --> 00:03:14,092
Belly of the pig.

87
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:15,360
Belly of the pig.

88
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:19,431
Like a surgeon.

89
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:22,768
Put a nice, little rub
  on them.

90
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:26,104
Beauty.

91
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:30,242
Stick this into a tub.

92
00:03:30,244 --> 00:03:33,478
Stack them up. Wrap them up.
  Let it sit for 24 hours.

93
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,780
We'll take it out.

94
00:03:34,782 --> 00:03:36,782
We're gonna submerge it
  in duck fat, roast it off.

95
00:03:36,784 --> 00:03:38,317
2½ to 3 hours or until done.

96
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,284
Or until done.

97
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:41,053
Now we make the batter.

98
00:03:41,055 --> 00:03:42,921
All-purpose flour.

99
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:43,989
Cornmeal.

100
00:03:43,991 --> 00:03:46,091
Sugar. Salt.

101
00:03:46,093 --> 00:03:47,693
Baking powder.

102
00:03:47,695 --> 00:03:48,927
Baking soda.

103
00:03:48,929 --> 00:03:51,230
Wow.
    Lighten it up.

104
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:53,966
Paprika.

105
00:03:53,968 --> 00:03:56,034
Gave it a little Elvis there
  at the end, didn't you?

106
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:57,169
I did.

107
00:03:57,171 --> 00:03:59,304
Buttermilk.
      Very nice.

108
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:01,573
Whole milk. Huevos.

109
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,642
Finally, oil.

110
00:04:03,644 --> 00:04:05,611
Combined well.

111
00:04:05,613 --> 00:04:08,814
Then, of course, this has to sit
 for a little while.

112
00:04:08,816 --> 00:04:10,749
Dig it.
 Yeah, you will.

113
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,417
Look at that, man.

114
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:13,285
Yum.

115
00:04:13,287 --> 00:04:17,723
Slagious, gelatinous
     maximus.

116
00:04:21,262 --> 00:04:22,761
I'll grab the skewer.
   Now we do the skewer.

117
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:24,696
Yep.
    Make sure you get
    inside the meat.

118
00:04:24,698 --> 00:04:25,964
Correct.

119
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:26,531
Into the dredge.

120
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:28,267
tipig,
  Correct.

121
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:30,102
and now we're gonna go
    to the batter.

122
00:04:30,104 --> 00:04:31,136
We are.

123
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:32,571
There we go.

124
00:04:32,573 --> 00:04:36,108
We're just trying to, like,
build a barrier here,

125
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,643
so it doesn't go
right to the bottom.

126
00:04:37,645 --> 00:04:40,579
Anticipation's
    just killing me.

127
00:04:40,581 --> 00:04:42,147
It's a "hunka hunka
    burning love."

128
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:44,249
You guys do have
 a heart-paddle kit here, right?

129
00:04:44,251 --> 00:04:46,351
Yes, we do.
    You're all set.

130
00:04:46,353 --> 00:04:49,521
Some of them pickled
habeneros and onions.

131
00:04:49,523 --> 00:04:51,523
A jalapeño aioli?
 Yeah.

132
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:53,425
All right.
   Let's get after this.

133
00:04:55,029 --> 00:04:56,495
Smells like corn dog.

134
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:01,466
That's a perfect storm.

135
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:05,637
It just has that really rich,
   intense pork flavor.

136
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:10,642
Then you get the texture
 and the crunch of the batter.

137
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:14,780
Then everything is cut
    and put into order

138
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:17,949
by the pickled onions
    and the habeneros.

139
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,251
That's a must-try.

140
00:05:19,253 --> 00:05:21,353
Yeah.
   I saw that on the menu.

141
00:05:21,355 --> 00:05:23,288
I said,
    "I must try that."

142
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,724
Awesome. Seriously.

143
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:29,561
Corn dog.

144
00:05:29,563 --> 00:05:32,197
I love the dog. There's
 the richness of the pork,

145
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:34,266
but then there's
 this awesome crunchiness

146
00:05:34,268 --> 00:05:35,767
from the outside of the batter.

147
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:37,903
To die for.

148
00:05:37,905 --> 00:05:39,104
It's a funky joint.

149
00:05:39,106 --> 00:05:41,006
You cruise in and tell me
    that I would find

150
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:42,941
a dish like that,
   I'd say you're crazy.

151
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:45,110
And the fact of the matter is,
    I think you are.

152
00:05:45,112 --> 00:05:46,044
A little.

153
00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:47,412
Yeah.
   Takes one to know one.

154
00:05:47,414 --> 00:05:52,150
If you want to have your taste
 buds completely electrified,

155
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:53,685
this is the place to come.

156
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:54,953
Congratulations.
     Thank you.

157
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:56,521
Thanks for saving
 the neighborhood.

158
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:57,589
Thank you for coming.

159
00:06:00,294 --> 00:06:02,861
Now we're cruising
  across the country

160
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:05,831
to the West Coast for some
 real-deal fish-and-chips.

161
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:08,033
So, here we are. Hunter and I
 are cruising State Street,

162
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:09,134
Santa Barbara, California,

163
00:06:09,136 --> 00:06:10,802
and we're looking for
  the real deal --

164
00:06:10,804 --> 00:06:13,171
I'm talking the authentic --
 British fish-and-chips joint.

165
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:14,506
And I think this might be it.

166
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:15,607
Hunter, grab us a table.

167
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:17,209
Don't start without me,
     all right?

168
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:18,343
I'm on it.

169
00:06:18,345 --> 00:06:20,679
Because this is
  Mac's Fish & Chip Shop.

170
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:26,017
And fish, chips, and mushy peas
 in the window.

171
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:28,353
Finding a fish-and-chips place
  in Santa Barbara

172
00:06:28,355 --> 00:06:29,621
is like a dream come true.

173
00:06:29,623 --> 00:06:31,823
By far the most authentic
 I've ever had in the U.S.

174
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:33,358
Well, that makes total sense,

175
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,361
since owner
 Grant "Mac" Macnaughton...

176
00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:40,065
Fish is up.
  ...is a real-deal Brit
  from across the pond.

177
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:42,367
All right, Chef, so I hear
 you're the fish-and-chip guy.

178
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:45,003
It's true. It's true. We make
some good fish-and-chips here.

179
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:46,805
What do you like about
 fish-and-chips?

180
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:48,807
I'm all about the real deal.
    I like everything.

181
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:50,842
I like, you know,
 the crispiness, the saltiness.

182
00:06:50,844 --> 00:06:52,644
Good man. We got some killer
fish-and-chips for you.

183
00:06:52,646 --> 00:06:53,912
All right.
So, let's start off.

184
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:55,680
We're gonna throw some
all-purpose flour down.

185
00:06:55,682 --> 00:06:57,516
Paprika.
Some kosher salt here.

186
00:06:57,518 --> 00:06:58,817
We'll get this
all nice and mixed up.

187
00:06:58,819 --> 00:06:59,985
This is where
 the beer comes in.

188
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:03,355
You wouldn't believe
  parking the car --

189
00:07:03,357 --> 00:07:06,158
I'm trying to park the car.
  You take over my show.

190
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,361
This is "Diners, Drive-Ins
 and Dives" with Guy Fieri.

191
00:07:09,363 --> 00:07:10,862
Hunter!
  Chef, nice to meet you.

192
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:13,231
Nice to meet you.
  Is my kid behaving
 himself in your kitchen?

193
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:15,000
Very much so.
  Where are we at so far?

194
00:07:15,002 --> 00:07:17,068
Yes, so, we're making
some of our beer batter

195
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,537
that goes
 on our crispy fish.

196
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:19,938
So, now we're gonna throw
 some beer in.

197
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,706
We're looking for the fizzier
the beer, the better.

198
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,942
We're looking to get
this nice and sticky
to start off with.

199
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:26,111
So, now we've kind of got this
 kind of paste.

200
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:28,313
It's almost like bread dough.
 Some cold water.

201
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:29,881
So, this batter's
pretty much ready now.

202
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:32,417
Let's start
  rocking and rolling.

203
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:34,219
Next we're gonna make
 our dry dredge.

204
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:35,687
All right.
  Now, season flour.

205
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:37,088
Kosher salt in there
and a little pepper.

206
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:39,591
Ready to go.
 Now the star of the show?

207
00:07:39,593 --> 00:07:42,294
We use wild Alaskan cod.
 Super sustainable.

208
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:44,796
How many pieces
 do you get with an order?
One whole fillet.

209
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:47,132
So, we're looking at around
about an 8-ounce piece of fish.

210
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:48,934
We're gonna drop it
into the seasoned flour.

211
00:07:48,936 --> 00:07:50,502
Make sure it gets
 completely covered.

212
00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:51,803
Drop it into the batter.

213
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:53,672
Pop it in.
 Let it float away.

214
00:07:53,674 --> 00:07:55,874
How long does this take?
3 or 4 minutes.

215
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:57,476
These fish are pretty close
 to being ready.

216
00:07:57,478 --> 00:07:59,277
We definitely want to get
these chips dropped now.

217
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,479
So, you don't call
   them fries.

218
00:08:00,481 --> 00:08:01,780
We call them chips, yeah.

219
00:08:01,782 --> 00:08:03,315
They're
 a much thicker cut.

220
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:05,183
All righty.
So, these fries are ready now.

221
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:06,418
Oh, I'm calling
  them fries.

222
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,453
I didn't do anything.
You're Americanizing me.

223
00:08:08,455 --> 00:08:10,055
Go ahead and pull
  those fries out.

224
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:11,389
All right.
These chips are done.

225
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:13,291
Our fish are there resting,
ready for us, as well,

226
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:14,726
and let's get this plated up.
  Dig in.

227
00:08:16,263 --> 00:08:18,597
Fresh fish, hand battered,
 chips you make yourself.

228
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:20,065
Look how thin
   that batter is.

229
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:21,633
Yeah, I like that
    a lot better.

230
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:23,201
I went to London
  when I was a kid

231
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:25,103
when I was an exchange student
   in France.

232
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:26,872
Had some fish-and-chips.

233
00:08:26,874 --> 00:08:28,640
My friend,
  that's the real deal.
I appreciate that.

234
00:08:28,642 --> 00:08:29,674
Nice job.
 ank you, man.

235
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,443
What do you think?
    Awesome job.

236
00:08:31,445 --> 00:08:32,911
Fish, chips,
   and coleslaw.

237
00:08:32,913 --> 00:08:34,746
What is it about the
fish-and-chips here
that make them so good?

238
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:37,148
Oh, it's just that fresh
   sort of crispiness,

239
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,884
but you still get
  the lightness of the fish.

240
00:08:38,886 --> 00:08:40,285
Some things we're just good at.

241
00:08:40,287 --> 00:08:43,321
Classic food. The comfort food.
    And we do it well.

242
00:08:43,323 --> 00:08:44,489
In here,
  you do it authentic.

243
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:45,857
Uh-huh.
   Real deal.

244
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:48,560
Real deal.
    Accent and all.

245
00:08:48,562 --> 00:08:49,661
Indeed.

246
00:08:52,099 --> 00:08:54,065
Coming up...
 Cheese fritters.

247
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:56,902
...we're headed
 to Horn Lake, Mississippi...

248
00:08:56,904 --> 00:08:59,170
That is the most cheese I've
ever seen in a cheese fritter.

249
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:00,438
...for a barbecue shack...

250
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,741
I didn't really put
"cheese sprinkler" on my résumé,

251
00:09:02,743 --> 00:09:04,442
but now that
I'm thinking about it.

252
00:09:04,444 --> 00:09:07,312
...serving up the cheesy side
  of fried goodness.

253
00:09:07,314 --> 00:09:08,413
It's an advertisement
  for a gym.

254
00:09:15,122 --> 00:09:16,321
You know, at "Triple D,"

255
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:18,456
we have shot
 so many barbecue restaurants,

256
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,992
but I got to tell you,
 the ones I really, really dig

257
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:23,895
is where the owners compete
 in barbecue competitions.

258
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,697
These folks here'tt et c.

259
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:28,233
They be kicking butt and taking
 names at some of the biggest.

260
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:30,869
So, I'm about 15 miles
 outside of downtown Memphis,

261
00:09:30,871 --> 00:09:35,240
but I'm in Mississippi to
 check out Memphis Barbecue Co.

262
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:37,842
One of the few restaurants
   that I can say

263
00:09:37,844 --> 00:09:39,711
that you will get
 world-championship barbecue.

264
00:09:39,713 --> 00:09:41,646
Can I get some
   cheese fritters please?

265
00:09:41,648 --> 00:09:44,215
But for this deep-fried
   appetizer,

266
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:47,886
pit master Melissa Cookston's
  putting down the meat

267
00:09:47,888 --> 00:09:50,522
for 13½ pounds
  of creamy goodness.

268
00:09:50,524 --> 00:09:53,358
4½, 4, 3, and 2.
 Seriously?

269
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,094
It's about the cheese.
    I love cheese.

270
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:58,897
All right.
Give me the rundown.
      All right.

271
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:00,932
We're gonna start off
   with some sour cream,

272
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:04,169
minced garlic, green onions,
    garlic salt.

273
00:10:04,171 --> 00:10:05,537
Nice.
     Yes.

274
00:10:05,539 --> 00:10:07,672
Kosher salt,
    parsley flakes,

275
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:11,076
and a little bit of cayenne
    for a little kick,

276
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:13,945
and whole lot
    of beaten eggs.

277
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:15,447
Can I lick the bowl?

278
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:18,617
Add flour.
Is this all-purpose flour?

279
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:20,185
This is actually
    self-rising flour

280
00:10:20,187 --> 00:10:22,053
because we want to be able
  to get the cheese balls

281
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:23,388
to puff up a little bit.

282
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,323
I'm gonna need your help
    in a minute.
Oh, absolutely.

283
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:26,725
Yeah, my hands are
    gonna be nasty, so.

284
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:28,360
Get a foot in there,
or what do you want to do?

285
00:10:28,362 --> 00:10:30,528
Just start pouring
   some of the cheese in.

286
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:31,796
Mozzarella.

287
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,765
I didn't really put
"cheese sprinkler" on my résumé,

288
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:35,834
but now that
I'm thinking about it.

289
00:10:35,836 --> 00:10:38,036
Swiss.
  You're doing a great job.
 Awesome.

290
00:10:38,038 --> 00:10:39,537
Parmesan.

291
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:41,840
That is the most cheese I've
ever seen in a cheese fritter.

292
00:10:41,842 --> 00:10:43,608
Cheddar.

293
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,413
All right.

294
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:52,484
This is where you really
start to get your workout.
      Yes.

295
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:53,918
Makes for
    nice big muscles.

296
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,287
Ah, okay. So, we take them,
roll them into a ball.

297
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:58,790
What size ball are you
gonna make them into?

298
00:10:58,792 --> 00:11:00,925
Whoa.

299
00:11:00,927 --> 00:11:03,862
All right, so, we're just gonna
    put them in oil --

300
00:11:03,864 --> 00:11:05,363
350 degrees.
     In what?

301
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:08,033
Oil.
   No, you didn't say it
    that way before.

302
00:11:08,035 --> 00:11:10,669
I love it. That's one of
  my favorite Southern words.

303
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:11,803
"Oll."
  Oll.

304
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,440
How long is this gonna
     go down for?
 Two minutes.

305
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:17,308
Okay. Wow.

306
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,710
These are golden.

307
00:11:18,712 --> 00:11:22,547
This is the honey Dijon --
   a mixture of honey,

308
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:25,283
Dijon mustard,
    spicy mustard,

309
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:27,819
sugar, you know,
   ooey-gooey goodness.

310
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:30,522
And then, voilà.

311
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,260
Mmm. That's nuts.

312
00:11:35,262 --> 00:11:37,362
The cheese that I really
 like out of that,

313
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:39,064
right off the bat,
 is that Swiss.

314
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:40,131
It holds together.

315
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:42,734
Not overly salty.
Not overly one flavor.

316
00:11:42,736 --> 00:11:44,836
I do get that garlic.
I do get that Swiss.

317
00:11:44,838 --> 00:11:47,005
Nice little crunchy texture
 on the outside.

318
00:11:47,007 --> 00:11:50,408
This honey Dijon moat that's in
does perfect for it.

319
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:51,776
That's crazy.

320
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:53,645
It's got a little bite to it.

321
00:11:53,647 --> 00:11:57,248
It's almost like a hush puppy
 stuffed with cream cheese.

322
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:00,518
It's more than just
your average cheese stick.

323
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,953
Cheese fritters.

324
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:03,822
The finest barbecue
  in the Mid-South area.

325
00:12:03,824 --> 00:12:04,956
What else
    do you want?

326
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,225
I got a cop
 and a guy that's with a cop.

327
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:08,493
They don't mind.

328
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:12,263
Next up...
 Check it out.

329
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:14,399
...a tap room
 on Philly's South Side...

330
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:16,434
Peanut butter and jelly
 going to table 5.

331
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:19,404
...turning the kiddie plate
 into a sweet masterpiece.

332
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:23,441
It's normal to see things like
a fried peanut butter and jelly?

333
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:24,476
Normal for here.

334
00:12:24,478 --> 00:12:26,678
And in Hoboken, New Jersey...

335
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,012
My eyeballs
 are sweating a bit.

336
00:12:28,014 --> 00:12:31,516
...the Cuban joint
 taking their turn in the fryer.

337
00:12:31,518 --> 00:12:35,587
This is the first discovered
culinary cave of Flavortown.

338
00:12:40,994 --> 00:12:42,627
"Triple D"
  is here in South Philly

339
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:44,329
to go to this
  funky little tap room.

340
00:12:44,331 --> 00:12:46,331
You're just gonna --
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

341
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,099
I said
you could drive the car.

342
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:50,735
This isn't "Diners, Drive-Ins
and Dives Unwrapped."

343
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:52,704
I'm Guy Fieri.
This is Marc Summers.

344
00:12:52,706 --> 00:12:55,373
And we're here to check out
the South Philadelphia Tap Room.

345
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:56,574
Yeah, Man.
   Check it out.

346
00:13:01,248 --> 00:13:02,347
Unbelievable.

347
00:13:02,349 --> 00:13:03,848
Just knock their socks off.

348
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:05,817
Vegan hoagie going to 21.

349
00:13:05,819 --> 00:13:08,086
This bar
  <i> is</i> the neighborhood.

350
00:13:08,088 --> 00:13:10,522
We always knew that we were
  gonna put something here

351
00:13:10,524 --> 00:13:14,058
that probably didn't belong
   in this neighborhood.

352
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,227
But if you build it,
   they will come,

353
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:17,629
and they have.

354
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:19,063
This bar really had
    a vital role

355
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:20,598
in revitalizing
    this neighborhood.

356
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,067
And that gamble's
 been paying off big-time

357
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:26,137
for John Longacre since 2003.

358
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:27,505
This is, like,
   where it's at?
    It really is.

359
00:13:27,507 --> 00:13:29,307
I mean, this is
  as South Philly as it gets.

360
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:32,210
Those props
 go to Chef Scott Schroeder.

361
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:34,245
Scott is fearless
   in the kitchen.

362
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:36,548
It's a little challenging,

363
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,950
and it pushed the boundaries
  of your own taste buds.

364
00:13:38,952 --> 00:13:42,320
It's normal to see things like
a fried peanut butter and jelly?

365
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:43,221
Normal for here.

366
00:13:44,758 --> 00:13:47,258
You know Marc Summers.

367
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,426
I do.
   Extraordinaire.

368
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:49,894
Since "Double Dare."
 Oh, my.

369
00:13:49,896 --> 00:13:51,796
You know what?
 Marc lives here in Philly.

370
00:13:51,798 --> 00:13:53,832
I thought he would be
 the perfect guy to bring down

371
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:55,567
to South Philadelphia
  to try the Tap Room.

372
00:13:55,569 --> 00:13:57,035
So, Chef Scott,
 what are you gonna make us?

373
00:13:57,037 --> 00:13:58,736
My signature dish,

374
00:13:58,738 --> 00:14:00,538
a fried peanut butter
   and jelly sandwich.

375
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,106
So, we're gonna start
     with making

376
00:14:02,108 --> 00:14:03,208
the french-toast batter.

377
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:04,943
We have eggs,
   fresh-ground nutmeg,

378
00:14:04,945 --> 00:14:07,245
salt, black pepper.
    Really?

379
00:14:07,247 --> 00:14:09,113
Vanilla extract, cinnamon.

380
00:14:10,984 --> 00:14:12,483
Just whisk that in
    a little bit.

381
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:13,351
Some sugar.

382
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:14,853
Heavy cream.

383
00:14:17,157 --> 00:14:19,023
Some whole milk.

384
00:14:21,094 --> 00:14:22,393
Okay.

385
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:24,162
Peanut butter and jelly.
    White bread.

386
00:14:24,164 --> 00:14:25,563
This is from Baker Street,

387
00:14:25,565 --> 00:14:27,298
a local bakery
   out in Chestnut Hill.

388
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,299
Peanut butter...

389
00:14:28,301 --> 00:14:31,169
and then
   strawberry preserves.

390
00:14:31,171 --> 00:14:33,605
Okay.
   PB&J's made.
       Yeah.

391
00:14:33,607 --> 00:14:36,474
So, now we're gonna just dip it
 in the french toast batter.

392
00:14:37,344 --> 00:14:39,978
What is this concoction here
   of dust?

393
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:43,615
Ground Frosted Flakes,
just pulsed in a food processor.

394
00:14:43,617 --> 00:14:46,517
Yeah, just on both sides,
    nice and crusted

395
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:48,987
Oh, man.
  Right?

396
00:14:48,989 --> 00:14:50,655
How bad can that be?

397
00:14:50,657 --> 00:14:53,258
Well, you get this
 and you get a free Spanx shirt.

398
00:14:55,295 --> 00:14:57,862
Look at the<i> cup</i> of butter
  that he put in there.

399
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:01,432
And the trick is
  don't touch it at first.

400
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:03,735
The sugar
   in the Frosted Flakes

401
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:05,837
are gonna
    kind of caramelize.

402
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,872
So, how long on that side
 are you frying it?

403
00:15:07,874 --> 00:15:10,408
Two to three minutes.

404
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:14,612
Split it into fours.

405
00:15:16,816 --> 00:15:18,750
<i> Bon appétit.</i>

406
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:21,819
You go first.

407
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:23,321
Oh, my.

408
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:27,558
Mmm.

409
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,527
Wow. That's awesome.

410
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:31,596
It's light.
  It's not super heavy.

411
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:33,665
A really good jam,
 nice creamy peanut butter.

412
00:15:33,667 --> 00:15:34,966
Everybody loves a PB&J.

413
00:15:34,968 --> 00:15:36,968
Take something simple,
 push it up another level.

414
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:37,969
Outrageous.

415
00:15:37,971 --> 00:15:39,370
What do you think, huh?

416
00:15:39,372 --> 00:15:40,972
The corn-flake topping...

417
00:15:40,974 --> 00:15:42,840
...is the pièce de résistance.
    Frosted flakes --

418
00:15:42,842 --> 00:15:44,976
Corn flakes would
   almost make it healthy.

419
00:15:44,978 --> 00:15:47,011
Do we look like
 we're on some health tour?

420
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:48,046
Look at us.

421
00:15:48,048 --> 00:15:50,014
Come on!
 Let's go chug some doughnuts!

422
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:52,016
It's like being a kid again.

423
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:53,551
The twist on it
  is the Frosted Flakes.

424
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:56,321
It just adds, like,
 a texture and a crunch to it.

425
00:15:56,323 --> 00:15:58,589
Cassie, pick up --
   Table 20.

426
00:15:59,225 --> 00:16:01,993
Once people find out it's here,
 they just keep coming in.

427
00:16:01,995 --> 00:16:05,029
That just comes with being
  a great restaurant.

428
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:07,031
I think everybody
 who misses a night here

429
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:09,500
and goes some place else
 in Philadelphia is
 missing out on the best.

430
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:11,269
Well, listen, it's
a funky joint, nice people,

431
00:16:11,271 --> 00:16:13,404
and you've got a real boss thing
 there with Chef.

432
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:15,673
I mean,
he is a true talent.

433
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:16,975
This is a place
people got to check out.

434
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:18,743
Thank you.
Thanks for having me.
 Appreciate it.

435
00:16:21,715 --> 00:16:23,982
From South Philly to New Jersey,

436
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:27,218
where we're hitting
 the fryer again, Cuban style.

437
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,153
I'm here on Washington Street.

438
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:31,689
Now, this is like the main drag
 here in Hoboken, New Jersey,

439
00:16:31,691 --> 00:16:34,092
and I'm right across the
Hudson River from New York City.

440
00:16:34,094 --> 00:16:36,594
Now, this area is loaded
 with great ethnic restaurants.

441
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:38,863
But when I hear
that there's a Cuban restaurant,

442
00:16:38,865 --> 00:16:40,465
you know I got to check it out.

443
00:16:40,467 --> 00:16:41,699
This is La Isla.

444
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:44,936
One picadillo,
   one arroz con pollo,

445
00:16:44,938 --> 00:16:46,938
one camarones encendido.

446
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,474
Good Cuban food. Makes you
  put a smile on your face.

447
00:16:49,476 --> 00:16:52,276
World-class flavors
 and a down-home experience.

448
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:56,280
Just what chef Omar Giner
  dreamed of as a kid.

449
00:16:56,282 --> 00:16:58,116
He used to tell me all the time,
   "I'm gonna be a chef.

450
00:16:58,118 --> 00:16:59,384
I'm gonna have
    my own restaurant."

451
00:16:59,386 --> 00:17:00,385
Here it is.

452
00:17:00,387 --> 00:17:02,320
Sometimes dreams do come true,

453
00:17:02,322 --> 00:17:03,855
and in '96, Omar and his wife

454
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:06,424
bought this neighborhood joint
  with her family...

455
00:17:06,426 --> 00:17:12,630
When Omar took over,
 it was a whole new flavor.

456
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:14,565
Mom, grandma,
    mother-in-law.

457
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:15,600
Mother-in-law?

458
00:17:15,602 --> 00:17:16,934
Mother-in-law.
     Absolutely.

459
00:17:16,936 --> 00:17:19,437
They've even got a Cuban spin
  on meat and potatoes.

460
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,306
Papa rellena salsa ranchera.
     Pick up.

461
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:23,841
Okay, what are we making?

462
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:26,377
The ground filling that we make
   for La Papa rellena.

463
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,613
We freshly grind
    our beef in-house.

464
00:17:28,615 --> 00:17:29,947
Okay.

465
00:17:29,949 --> 00:17:33,117
Heat up our pan, and we're gonna
 add our olive oil in there.

466
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:35,686
Drop in our diced onions,
     garlic,

467
00:17:35,688 --> 00:17:38,222
our bay leaf in there,
     oregano.

468
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,091
This is cumin that we toast
   and we grind in-house.

469
00:17:40,093 --> 00:17:41,492
That's just
   my little twist on it.

470
00:17:41,494 --> 00:17:43,795
And then we also add a little
  smoked paprika, as well.

471
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:47,732
Add our ground beef.

472
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:49,000
Now we're gonna hit
    the tomato paste.

473
00:17:49,002 --> 00:17:51,102
Cook that out --
   give it a little color.

474
00:17:51,104 --> 00:17:53,204
We'll add a little salt,
 and we'll add some white wine.

475
00:17:53,206 --> 00:17:54,772
Give it
   a little liquid there.

476
00:17:57,143 --> 00:17:58,876
Now we're gonna assemble
    our papa rellena.

477
00:17:58,878 --> 00:18:00,478
We got the mashed potatoes.
    Mashed potatoes.

478
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,813
The picadillo
 that we cooled.

479
00:18:01,815 --> 00:18:03,681
So, what we're
    just gonna do is

480
00:18:03,683 --> 00:18:05,750
get ourselves a nice
  little ball here of potato.

481
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:08,753
so, if you're late for work,
you get stuck with this job.

482
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:09,954
That's it.

483
00:18:09,956 --> 00:18:11,756
Look at that thing.

484
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:13,591
We're gonna drop it
    in the egg wash.

485
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:14,892
I'm gonna use a spoon,

486
00:18:14,894 --> 00:18:17,462
so that way,
  I can keep off my hands.

487
00:18:17,464 --> 00:18:19,163
Next, they go
   into the fine panko.

488
00:18:19,165 --> 00:18:21,566
Back in again.
    Back in again.

489
00:18:21,568 --> 00:18:25,903
And then into
    the coarse panko.

490
00:18:25,905 --> 00:18:28,473
Okay.
 Now goes the fryer.

491
00:18:28,475 --> 00:18:30,174
For about four minutes?

492
00:18:30,176 --> 00:18:31,609
Four minutes
   till it's Golden Brown.

493
00:18:32,979 --> 00:18:35,279
Oh, boy.

494
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,315
Ranchera sauce.

495
00:18:37,317 --> 00:18:38,483
Ranchera sauce?

496
00:18:38,485 --> 00:18:40,118
Ranchera sauce.
Ranchera sauce.

497
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,420
So, look at that.

498
00:18:42,422 --> 00:18:47,258
This is the first discovered
culinary cave of Flavortown.

499
00:18:51,531 --> 00:18:53,865
Mmm. Oh.

500
00:18:53,867 --> 00:18:56,200
That sauce is ridiculous.

501
00:18:56,202 --> 00:18:57,435
Mmm!

502
00:18:57,437 --> 00:19:00,238
But I think that the combination
that you put together,

503
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,173
along with this meat
 and the potato

504
00:19:02,175 --> 00:19:04,375
and the little crunchy
crispiness on the outside

505
00:19:04,377 --> 00:19:06,210
from the panko --
that is killer, dude.

506
00:19:06,212 --> 00:19:08,913
Mmm.

507
00:19:08,915 --> 00:19:11,149
Chef, awesome job.

508
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:12,950
My eyeballs
 are sweating a bit.

509
00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:14,886
Papa's ready.

510
00:19:14,888 --> 00:19:16,521
What do you think
    makes it so good?

511
00:19:16,523 --> 00:19:17,388
It's authentic.

512
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:19,357
This is like Cuban plus.

513
00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:23,361
Chef, you're the bomb.

514
00:19:23,363 --> 00:19:24,929
Awesome. Awesome.
     Thanks, man.

515
00:19:27,901 --> 00:19:30,001
Coming up
 on "Deep Fried All-Stars"...

516
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:31,302
Jazz hands.
     Jazz hands.

517
00:19:31,304 --> 00:19:32,370
There you go.

518
00:19:32,372 --> 00:19:34,272
We're heading
 to Memphis, Tennessee...

519
00:19:34,274 --> 00:19:36,874
Mommy!
 That was hot.

520
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:39,310
...where they're spicing up
  a Southern staple.

521
00:19:39,312 --> 00:19:41,546
Can I get a little John Candy
 before we go?
      All right.

522
00:19:41,548 --> 00:19:43,781
Then in Narragansett,
   Rhode Island...

523
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:46,417
Clam cake please.
 ...a summertime clam shack...

524
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:48,186
Ladies and gentlemen at home,
I want to explain this to you --

525
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:49,520
this is a cement mixer.

526
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,389
...dunking the classic cakes.

527
00:19:51,391 --> 00:19:52,523
Ooh!
You cooked it in beef fat.

528
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:05,670
Oh, I dig coming down
   to Memphis.

529
00:20:08,074 --> 00:20:11,209
I mean, so much history and some
 great "Triple D" joints.

530
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:13,044
So, I'm in an area
  called South Main

531
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:14,245
right by Central Station

532
00:20:14,247 --> 00:20:16,414
to check out a little
  hole-in-the-wall joint

533
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:18,849
called Rizzo's Diner.

534
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:20,618
When you walk in
  off the streets,

535
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,353
you really don't know
   what to expect.

536
00:20:22,355 --> 00:20:23,955
Lobster Pronto Pup up.

537
00:20:23,957 --> 00:20:26,757
Michael is a well-known chef
 around this city.

538
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:29,260
We've been following him
    around Memphis

539
00:20:29,262 --> 00:20:31,295
from restaurant
    to restaurant.

540
00:20:31,297 --> 00:20:33,297
I stalked Michael Patrick,
     the chef.

541
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:35,132
He is our favorite.
 You mean Rizzo?

542
00:20:35,134 --> 00:20:37,268
A nickname
 that followed Michael Patrick

543
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:39,503
all the way
 from his hometown of Cleveland.

544
00:20:39,505 --> 00:20:40,972
It's nice
    to follow him here

545
00:20:40,974 --> 00:20:43,407
to where we can share
 in a little piece of his dream.

546
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:47,211
Which involved opening a joint
 with his name on it in 2011.

547
00:20:47,213 --> 00:20:48,512
Order up.

548
00:20:48,514 --> 00:20:50,081
We're a casual, upscale diner.

549
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,149
I take some traditional
   Southern food

550
00:20:52,151 --> 00:20:54,685
and kind of jazz it up
 with a chef's interpretation.

551
00:20:54,687 --> 00:20:56,887
Put them both up please.
  Like this.

552
00:20:56,889 --> 00:20:58,789
Jazz hands.
     Jazz hands.

553
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,625
There you go.
That's jazzing it up.

554
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:04,795
Got ice cream
   on the French toast.

555
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:06,397
Smoked Duck Tamale Pie.

556
00:21:06,399 --> 00:21:08,666
Lobster Pronto Pup.

557
00:21:08,668 --> 00:21:10,601
Sort of like healthy
 carnival food.

558
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:12,403
Lobster Pronto Pups?
   Lobster Pronto Pups.
     Yeah.

559
00:21:12,405 --> 00:21:14,238
I wanted to take
    the Pronto Pup

560
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,173
and jazz it up,
    as I said before.

561
00:21:16,175 --> 00:21:17,441
Jazz hands.

562
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:20,144
Wow, that's a full
floor show, isn't it?

563
00:21:20,146 --> 00:21:21,746
All right, we're gonna start
    with some flour.

564
00:21:21,748 --> 00:21:24,715
Sugar.
    We got dry mustard.

565
00:21:24,717 --> 00:21:27,551
Salt and pepper.
     Cornstarch.

566
00:21:27,553 --> 00:21:29,487
An egg.

567
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:30,554
Now we're gonna add
     our milk.

568
00:21:30,556 --> 00:21:31,722
And we have
   some lemon-lime soda.

569
00:21:31,724 --> 00:21:32,957
For the carbonation?
     Right.

570
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:34,225
So, we're here
    in the South.

571
00:21:34,227 --> 00:21:35,860
We want to sweeten it up
    a little bit.

572
00:21:35,862 --> 00:21:40,031
Scald this together.
 Nice and creamy.

573
00:21:40,033 --> 00:21:42,933
Our next step would be
   to do our lobster meat.

574
00:21:42,935 --> 00:21:45,202
Five of them.
Little slipper lobsters.

575
00:21:45,204 --> 00:21:48,539
There you go.
One, two, three, four, five.

576
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:49,807
Take this.
  Split it all the way down.

577
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:51,809
Remove the meat.

578
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:53,678
It curls up pretty good
    when it blanches.

579
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,246
You gonna blanch
 the meat first?

580
00:21:55,248 --> 00:21:56,814
It's gonna be
 a little parcooked.

581
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:59,150
Then we got
   our boiling water here.

582
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:00,318
A little lemon.

583
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,919
Salt and pepper, you want?
      Yes, sir.

584
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:05,589
We'll add the meat.
    Drop them in.

585
00:22:05,591 --> 00:22:07,191
This is just gonna go
 hot and fast.

586
00:22:07,193 --> 00:22:09,126
All it needs is
   about 2 to 3 minutes.

587
00:22:10,563 --> 00:22:12,663
All right, so, we're gonna
   remove the lobster.

588
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:14,231
Kind of like
 bobbing for apples.

589
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:15,666
And then ice bath?

590
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:17,435
Gonna rest them here just to
 absorb some of that moisture.

591
00:22:17,437 --> 00:22:18,936
Now we're gonna
    skewer this meat.

592
00:22:18,938 --> 00:22:20,371
Run it through here.

593
00:22:20,373 --> 00:22:22,106
Want to get to the middle of it
  to get it nice and tight.

594
00:22:22,108 --> 00:22:23,574
This isn't any joke here.
This is the real deal.

595
00:22:23,576 --> 00:22:24,975
I mean,
you're loading it up.

596
00:22:24,977 --> 00:22:27,645
So, now we're gonna batter
 the Lobster Pronto Pup to fry.

597
00:22:27,647 --> 00:22:29,347
Nice little coating.

598
00:22:29,349 --> 00:22:31,649
Oh-oh.
That's gonna be good.

599
00:22:31,651 --> 00:22:32,950
When they're floating,

600
00:22:32,952 --> 00:22:34,819
I'll give them another,
  you know, 30, 40 seconds.

601
00:22:34,821 --> 00:22:36,587
All you really have to
 wait for on this

602
00:22:36,589 --> 00:22:38,589
is for that batter to brown up
 on the outside

603
00:22:38,591 --> 00:22:41,125
because that slipper lobster
is cooked all the way through.

604
00:22:41,127 --> 00:22:42,526
Yes.
 How we looking?

605
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:43,761
We're looking there.

606
00:22:43,763 --> 00:22:46,831
A lobster corn dog.
    Only in Memphis.

607
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:48,833
Now we're gonna take
    a little arugula.

608
00:22:48,835 --> 00:22:50,534
A little olive oil.
    Salt and pepper.

609
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:53,170
Lay these on
    in a little cross.

610
00:22:53,172 --> 00:22:55,840
Then we're gonna drizzle
 a little Creole mustard aioli.

611
00:22:55,842 --> 00:22:58,309
Okay.
 Wow, that's hot.

612
00:23:01,247 --> 00:23:03,114
Mommy!
 That was hot.

613
00:23:06,352 --> 00:23:08,452
Wow.
The lobster's super tender.

614
00:23:08,454 --> 00:23:10,121
It's just delicate.
  Mmm.

615
00:23:10,123 --> 00:23:11,989
I mean, this isn't even
tempura-batter tender.

616
00:23:11,991 --> 00:23:13,357
This is even lighter
  than that.

617
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:15,159
And there's a little bit
 of sweetness to it,

618
00:23:15,161 --> 00:23:16,994
but then you balance it out
 with the acidity,

619
00:23:16,996 --> 00:23:18,429
you know,
of that Creole mustard.

620
00:23:18,431 --> 00:23:20,264
That is
Lobster Corn Dog 101.

621
00:23:20,266 --> 00:23:23,033
Nicely done.
   Thank you very much.

622
00:23:23,035 --> 00:23:25,770
It is like heaven on a stick.

623
00:23:25,772 --> 00:23:27,505
You didn't know
 his name was Rizzo?

624
00:23:27,507 --> 00:23:29,273
No, I always called him
    Michael Patrick.

625
00:23:29,275 --> 00:23:30,274
Michael Patrick?

626
00:23:30,276 --> 00:23:31,275
Yes, sir.

627
00:23:31,277 --> 00:23:32,476
Dude, I loved you
 in Riverdance.

628
00:23:32,478 --> 00:23:33,477
You were the bomb.

629
00:23:42,889 --> 00:23:44,955
Now we're gonna boogie up
 to the Rhode Island shore

630
00:23:44,957 --> 00:23:46,390
for a little more sizzle.

631
00:23:46,392 --> 00:23:48,159
I've been coming to Rhode Island

632
00:23:48,161 --> 00:23:50,895
for like the last 20 years
  to visit the in-laws.

633
00:23:50,897 --> 00:23:53,464
And my father-in-law Bob --
 greatest guy in the world --

634
00:23:53,466 --> 00:23:54,765
would always make sure

635
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:56,934
that I got to try some of
 the "regional specialties."

636
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:59,737
Oh, he introduced me
 to coffee milk and hot grinders

637
00:23:59,739 --> 00:24:02,473
and hot wieners and Johnnycakes,
  and then he says,

638
00:24:02,475 --> 00:24:05,342
"Guid, you got to try this one.
  This is a clam cake."

639
00:24:05,344 --> 00:24:06,777
I said, "Clam in a cake?"

640
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:09,180
So I'm here in Narragansett
  right by Point Judith

641
00:24:09,182 --> 00:24:11,882
to check out a joint
 that is rocking the clam cakes.

642
00:24:11,884 --> 00:24:14,084
This is Aunt Carrie's.

643
00:24:14,086 --> 00:24:17,054
Clam and lobster.
 Everybody knows about it,
  and they do come back.

644
00:24:17,056 --> 00:24:19,190
A lot of times
  it's year after year.

645
00:24:19,192 --> 00:24:21,392
Since the '20s,
  when Carrie Cooper

646
00:24:21,394 --> 00:24:24,195
and her husband Ulysses
 opened this summer-only joint.

647
00:24:24,197 --> 00:24:25,763
Hey, girls.
     Hi, El.

648
00:24:25,765 --> 00:24:27,531
The family tradition
   continues today

649
00:24:27,533 --> 00:24:30,367
led by third generation owner
   Elsie Foy.

650
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:32,903
This place has got
  to be bananas busy.

651
00:24:32,905 --> 00:24:34,605
Once Fourth of July
 rolls around,

652
00:24:34,607 --> 00:24:36,240
it's kind of busy
 every night, yeah.

653
00:24:36,242 --> 00:24:37,808
Thanks to
  the star attraction...

654
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:38,876
Clam cake, please.

655
00:24:38,878 --> 00:24:40,744
...a deep-fried
  Rhode Island legend

656
00:24:40,746 --> 00:24:43,914
that's been around
  for over 90 years.

657
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:46,217
So we're gonna make the flour
 for the clam cakes.
       Yes.

658
00:24:46,219 --> 00:24:47,818
This is what
 we're mixing it in?
       We are.

659
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,087
Ladies and gentlemen at home,
I want to explain this to you.

660
00:24:50,089 --> 00:24:51,822
This is
 a cement mixer.
   Never used for cement.

661
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:52,823
No, I understand that.

662
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:54,558
All right,
so all-purpose flour.

663
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,461
And you want this
 in the mixer?
     Yes, please.

664
00:24:57,463 --> 00:25:01,065
Baking powder.
And this is gonna sit here
 and just mix up.

665
00:25:01,067 --> 00:25:02,867
And a little bit
 of salt, too?
    Little bit of salt.

666
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:07,071
What an awesome sound.

667
00:25:07,073 --> 00:25:09,840
Mix this,
 dump it in the tub.

668
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:12,910
I'm gonna be pushing this,
  aren't I?
       Yes.

669
00:25:12,912 --> 00:25:15,246
Now it's clam cake time?
     Yeah.

670
00:25:15,248 --> 00:25:16,914
We're gonna add
     some eggs.
 Okay.

671
00:25:16,916 --> 00:25:18,082
Clams.
So this is real deal.

672
00:25:18,084 --> 00:25:19,383
This is not
some frozen product.

673
00:25:19,385 --> 00:25:20,451
All of 'em?
     All of them.

674
00:25:20,453 --> 00:25:21,919
Bucket o' clam.

675
00:25:21,921 --> 00:25:23,420
We do add
   a little bit of water

676
00:25:23,422 --> 00:25:25,589
because we also
    want them fluffy.
Okeydokey.

677
00:25:25,591 --> 00:25:27,391
And our special
    clam cake flour.

678
00:25:27,393 --> 00:25:29,527
I might have
    to have you -- yes.

679
00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:32,129
Hold on to it, Gilligan. We've
got rough seas in a minute.

680
00:25:32,131 --> 00:25:33,931
Look at that.
    Perfect batter.

681
00:25:33,933 --> 00:25:35,766
The fryer's at what temp?
     375.

682
00:25:35,768 --> 00:25:38,068
Like that?
     Absolutely.

683
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,336
No.

684
00:25:39,338 --> 00:25:42,239
Oh, that's why you rock this.

685
00:25:42,241 --> 00:25:44,241
We ready to go?
     We are ready.

686
00:25:44,243 --> 00:25:46,310
So you're just
  going in.
    Very, very careful.

687
00:25:49,081 --> 00:25:50,648
It takes
    about five minutes.

688
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:52,449
We want to make sure
    they're done.

689
00:25:52,451 --> 00:25:54,285
Okay. Comes out clean.
    Like a cake.

690
00:25:54,287 --> 00:25:57,354
You're good to go.
 And what do people
eat a clam cake with?

691
00:25:57,356 --> 00:25:59,924
Usually with "chow-dah."
With chow-dah.

692
00:25:59,926 --> 00:26:03,928
You're ready to rock.
   We are. Simple, simple
    South county food.

693
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:07,331
Oh!
You cooked it in beef fat.

694
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:10,100
It's rich. It's light.
A lot of clam flavor.

695
00:26:10,102 --> 00:26:12,770
Mmm. This is exceptional.

696
00:26:12,772 --> 00:26:14,505
Our base chowder --

697
00:26:14,507 --> 00:26:16,974
Now you have to dip
  your clam cakes in that.

698
00:26:16,976 --> 00:26:18,275
Okay. Mm-hmm.

699
00:26:18,277 --> 00:26:20,711
It's simply done --
  Mmm --

700
00:26:20,713 --> 00:26:23,113
and done to perfection.
  I love it.
      Thank you.

701
00:26:23,115 --> 00:26:25,683
Combo with clear chowder.

702
00:26:25,685 --> 00:26:27,985
You pull apart the clam cake,
  dip it in the chowder,

703
00:26:27,987 --> 00:26:30,854
and you get to taste lots
 of clams and a ton of flavor.

704
00:26:30,856 --> 00:26:32,056
It's delicious.

705
00:26:32,058 --> 00:26:34,024
Carrie's is like an icon
  to Narragansett,

706
00:26:34,026 --> 00:26:35,726
and it's just fun to see
 that the place hasn't changed.

707
00:26:35,728 --> 00:26:37,995
You get a chance to come here
 a couple times in the summer.

708
00:26:37,997 --> 00:26:39,964
This is an indulgence.
 You're down by the water.

709
00:26:39,966 --> 00:26:41,865
If you're gonna have a clam
 cake, cook 'em with lard.

710
00:26:41,867 --> 00:26:43,934
Tell my secret.
Oh, I am down with it.

711
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:45,970
I am so excited.
You're gonna love it.

712
00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:50,641
Coming up...
  Let's get
 into the sandwich.

713
00:26:50,643 --> 00:26:52,576
...we're headed
  to San Francisco...

714
00:26:52,578 --> 00:26:53,944
Fried-chicken sandwich.
     Order up.

715
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:55,446
...where a hot-dog shop...

716
00:26:55,448 --> 00:26:57,648
That's like a Pink Floyd
 concert, Man.

717
00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:01,085
...is knocking fried chicken
  out of the ballpark.

718
00:27:01,087 --> 00:27:03,354
It should say
"Show Chicken."

719
00:27:03,356 --> 00:27:04,722
And in Chatham, New Jersey...

720
00:27:04,724 --> 00:27:06,523
We're gonna go
   on the crispy chicken

721
00:27:06,525 --> 00:27:07,691
and the penne vodka now.

722
00:27:07,693 --> 00:27:08,926
Whatever you want, Honey.

723
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,127
The Italian joint...

724
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:11,328
Hello.

725
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:13,530
...where an old buddy...
      Easy. Easy.

726
00:27:13,532 --> 00:27:14,665
...and his better half...

727
00:27:14,667 --> 00:27:16,300
That right there,
    rocks the house.

728
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:19,336
...are frying up
  pure Italian comfort.

729
00:27:19,338 --> 00:27:21,205
If you've never had an arancini
  ball, you must try it.

730
00:27:28,881 --> 00:27:31,782
So, I'm here in the Tenderloin
 district of San Francisco,

731
00:27:31,784 --> 00:27:34,084
right on the corner
 of Market and Golden Gate,

732
00:27:34,086 --> 00:27:37,054
to check out a hot-dog joint --
 Not just any hot-dog joint.

733
00:27:37,056 --> 00:27:38,188
I mean,
  this is San Francisco.

734
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:39,723
They love food in this town.

735
00:27:39,725 --> 00:27:41,925
This place, they're
 scratch-making the mustard,

736
00:27:41,927 --> 00:27:43,460
the ketchup,
  and the gourmet dogs.

737
00:27:43,462 --> 00:27:44,895
This is Show Dogs.

738
00:27:47,366 --> 00:27:48,799
Wild-boar sausage.

739
00:27:48,801 --> 00:27:51,201
This is definitely
 not your average hot dog.

740
00:27:51,203 --> 00:27:53,671
Every dish has
 a different twist to it.

741
00:27:53,673 --> 00:27:56,440
'Cause owner John Clark
 isn't just a businessman.

742
00:27:56,442 --> 00:27:59,576
He's a flat-out food dude.

743
00:27:59,578 --> 00:28:03,080
My background as a chef is
to make everything in-house.

744
00:28:03,082 --> 00:28:04,114
It's the opposite
    of fast food.

745
00:28:04,116 --> 00:28:06,316
So, he brought in
  Chef Seth Carter...

746
00:28:06,318 --> 00:28:07,584
Polish dog. Order up.

747
00:28:07,586 --> 00:28:10,387
...and together,
  they've created a menu

748
00:28:10,389 --> 00:28:13,490
full of scratch-made sodas,
  sauces, and sides

749
00:28:13,492 --> 00:28:16,026
to pair with their
 gourmet dogs and sandwiches,

750
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:17,861
like this high-end clucker.

751
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:19,196
Fried-chicken sandwich.
     Order up.

752
00:28:20,566 --> 00:28:22,433
We are making
    the spice mixture

753
00:28:22,435 --> 00:28:23,867
that we use to marinate
     the chicken

754
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:25,202
for the fried-chicken
     sandwich.

755
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:27,671
So, we have kosher salt.
    Vinegar powder.

756
00:28:27,673 --> 00:28:29,807
Vinegar powder?

757
00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:30,874
Vinegar powder.

758
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:32,743
Onion powder.

759
00:28:32,745 --> 00:28:34,511
Madras curry powder.

760
00:28:34,513 --> 00:28:36,380
Turmeric.

761
00:28:36,382 --> 00:28:37,981
Garlic powder.

762
00:28:37,983 --> 00:28:40,150
Black pepper.

763
00:28:40,152 --> 00:28:42,986
Toasted ground cumin.

764
00:28:42,988 --> 00:28:44,121
Bring it together?
    Bring it together.

765
00:28:46,492 --> 00:28:48,058
We have grape-seed oil.

766
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,493
We're gonna put some of that
   over the chicken...

767
00:28:49,495 --> 00:28:51,028
Look at that beautiful color
on that grape-seed oil.

768
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:53,797
...and spoon some
  of the marinade over it.

769
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:55,132
And then we're gonna
     mix it up.

770
00:28:57,536 --> 00:28:59,503
How long are we gonna
 let this marinate?

771
00:28:59,505 --> 00:29:00,504
A couple hours.

772
00:29:04,043 --> 00:29:05,542
We got
   our marinated chicken.

773
00:29:05,544 --> 00:29:07,377
We're gonna add the salt
    to the flour.

774
00:29:07,379 --> 00:29:09,213
A.P. flour?
     A.P. flour.

775
00:29:09,215 --> 00:29:10,347
Okay.
     All right.

776
00:29:10,349 --> 00:29:13,550
Chicken --
   We put it in the flour.

777
00:29:13,552 --> 00:29:14,685
Get it in the buttermilk.

778
00:29:14,687 --> 00:29:16,353
Flour sticks
 to the chicken.

779
00:29:16,355 --> 00:29:18,188
Buttermilk sticks
 to the flour.

780
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:20,724
And back into the flour.

781
00:29:20,726 --> 00:29:22,626
And that's all she wrote?
   That's all she wrote.

782
00:29:22,628 --> 00:29:25,796
We're gonna fry this
   for about two minutes,

783
00:29:25,798 --> 00:29:27,898
and then we'll be
    ready to go.

784
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,032
We take the bottom bun,

785
00:29:29,034 --> 00:29:31,068
slather it with our
    lemon-cayenne aioli

786
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,302
that we make
    here in-house.
 Slather?

787
00:29:32,304 --> 00:29:33,437
Slather.
  It's a very specific word.

788
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:35,873
Our house-made coleslaw.

789
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:38,442
Our pickled ginger
  that we also make in-house.

790
00:29:42,882 --> 00:29:45,149
There's
    our fried chicken.

791
00:29:45,151 --> 00:29:47,618
And slather this bun

792
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,586
with our lemon-cayenne aioli
     again.

793
00:29:49,588 --> 00:29:50,954
And there we go.

794
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:52,689
Let's get
 into this sandwich.

795
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:59,096
Whoo!
Shut the front door!

796
00:30:01,567 --> 00:30:03,767
That fried chicken is
 out-of-bounds.
      Yeah.

797
00:30:03,769 --> 00:30:06,370
This is -- Whoa.

798
00:30:06,372 --> 00:30:08,539
There's flavor
all over the board on this one.

799
00:30:10,709 --> 00:30:12,910
That's like
a Pink Floyd concert, man.

800
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:15,245
Classic.

801
00:30:15,247 --> 00:30:18,048
It is a classic,
  but wow.
      Yes.

802
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:23,220
The crunch from the chicken
and the saltiness to it

803
00:30:23,222 --> 00:30:24,788
is just perfectly
  in balance.

804
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:27,257
That is an awesome
fried-chicken sandwich.

805
00:30:27,259 --> 00:30:28,358
Mmm!
     Thank you.

806
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,760
It should say
 "Show Chicken."

807
00:30:31,964 --> 00:30:33,397
Out of the chicken sandwiches
   I've had,

808
00:30:33,399 --> 00:30:35,299
this is, by far,
   my favorite.

809
00:30:35,301 --> 00:30:38,302
and the window show is
    unbelievable.

810
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:42,573
Come with a sense of humor
 and an open mind,

811
00:30:42,575 --> 00:30:43,740
and it's great.

812
00:30:46,612 --> 00:30:48,779
Speaking of a sense of humor,

813
00:30:48,781 --> 00:30:51,715
you got to meet my friends
 doing a fried dish right.

814
00:30:51,717 --> 00:30:53,517
So, I'm here
  in Chatham, New Jersey,

815
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:56,286
about 35 miles west
  of New York City.

816
00:30:56,288 --> 00:30:58,322
Now, I've been cooking
 with Carl Ruiz for years --

817
00:30:58,324 --> 00:30:59,423
awesome chef.

818
00:30:59,425 --> 00:31:00,624
And I've been telling him,

819
00:31:00,626 --> 00:31:02,326
"You got to open
  your own joint."

820
00:31:02,328 --> 00:31:04,261
Finally, he and his wife
   took my advice

821
00:31:04,263 --> 00:31:05,796
and opened their own place.

822
00:31:05,798 --> 00:31:08,465
And they were smart --
 they named it after her.

823
00:31:08,467 --> 00:31:10,667
This is Marie's
  Italian Specialties.

824
00:31:11,604 --> 00:31:13,837
This is like sitting
  in my mother's kitchen.

825
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:15,939
On a scale of 1 to 10,
 I would give this place a 15.

826
00:31:15,941 --> 00:31:17,140
Makes sense.

827
00:31:17,142 --> 00:31:19,543
Carl's one of the craziest
   chefs I know.

828
00:31:19,545 --> 00:31:20,577
Easy, easy!

829
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:22,179
What makes your
Italian food different?

830
00:31:22,181 --> 00:31:23,914
It's just
  simple Italian food,

831
00:31:23,916 --> 00:31:26,049
but we do it
 with the best ingredients.

832
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:28,652
And a little sideshow.

833
00:31:28,654 --> 00:31:29,753
Today we're gonna --

834
00:31:29,755 --> 00:31:30,921
Aah!

835
00:31:30,923 --> 00:31:34,758
Don't make me nuts.
 I have a family.

836
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:38,695
This is like culinary
 Disneyland, and this is Goofy.

837
00:31:38,697 --> 00:31:40,163
Hello!

838
00:31:40,165 --> 00:31:42,966
Now I get to work with the real
 brains of this operation...

839
00:31:42,968 --> 00:31:45,636
We're gonna go on the crispy
chicken and the penne vodka now.

840
00:31:45,638 --> 00:31:46,870
Whatever you want, honey.

841
00:31:46,872 --> 00:31:48,138
...his wife, Marie.

842
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:50,407
Marie is the biggest
  hidden secret you ever met.

843
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:53,110
Okay, what are you
    gonna make me?

844
00:31:53,112 --> 00:31:55,312
Okay, we're gonna make
the risotto for the arancini.

845
00:31:55,314 --> 00:31:56,680
Okay, the arancini.
 Arancini.

846
00:31:56,682 --> 00:31:57,781
They're rice balls, okay?

847
00:31:57,783 --> 00:31:59,249
Different styles
    of making them.

848
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:00,617
This is
   gonna be interesting.

849
00:32:00,619 --> 00:32:04,254
That's hot, so we're just
gonna take arborio rice.

850
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:06,890
And we're gonna
 toast it first.

851
00:32:06,892 --> 00:32:09,860
Okay, so now it's toasted
  up to the color we want.

852
00:32:09,862 --> 00:32:13,463
So, we add one quart
 of salted water.

853
00:32:13,465 --> 00:32:14,865
We don't want it
to get really mushy.

854
00:32:14,867 --> 00:32:17,267
Normally, with risotto,
it's very, very creamy.

855
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:19,436
We want it to almost have
the same texture as rice.

856
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:22,773
Now we're gonna make
    the tomato sauce.

857
00:32:22,775 --> 00:32:26,543
Extra virgin olive oil,
 pureed garlic.

858
00:32:26,545 --> 00:32:28,679
And then we're gonna add
 tomato sauce.

859
00:32:28,681 --> 00:32:31,949
Dry basil,
 granulated garlic.

860
00:32:31,951 --> 00:32:34,785
Copious amount. Wow!

861
00:32:34,787 --> 00:32:37,054
And just
a little bit of salt.

862
00:32:37,056 --> 00:32:39,089
We get it going
 for about an hour,

863
00:32:39,091 --> 00:32:40,724
and then we put
our raw meatballs in.

864
00:32:40,726 --> 00:32:43,126
This has got the --

865
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:44,628
Ground beef,
granulated garlic and basil,

866
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:47,331
parmesan cheese,
 bread crumbs, salt.

867
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:49,399
So, they'll cook
    inside the sauce?

868
00:32:49,401 --> 00:32:50,734
They cook in the sauce.

869
00:32:50,736 --> 00:32:52,536
Okay, we're gonna make
  rice balls.

870
00:32:52,538 --> 00:32:53,904
Give me a rundown.

871
00:32:53,906 --> 00:32:55,906
So, we're gonna start
with our homemade meatballs.

872
00:32:55,908 --> 00:32:57,841
The meatballs that we cooked
    in the sauce.

873
00:32:57,843 --> 00:33:00,210
The parmesan cheese,
 dried parsley,

874
00:33:00,212 --> 00:33:03,780
granulated garlic,
 six large eggs,

875
00:33:03,782 --> 00:33:06,950
shredded mozzarella,
and seasoned bread crumbs.

876
00:33:10,022 --> 00:33:12,155
Now we're gonna add
  the rice.

877
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:13,256
We're gonna fluff it up
 a little bit.

878
00:33:13,258 --> 00:33:15,759
Then we're gonna add
  our salt,

879
00:33:15,761 --> 00:33:19,796
some of the tomato sauce,
give it a final mix.

880
00:33:19,798 --> 00:33:21,765
And now you start to form
    the arancini.

881
00:33:21,767 --> 00:33:23,567
Exactly.

882
00:33:25,204 --> 00:33:27,337
Just a little coating
   of some bread crumbs.

883
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:29,673
350.
 350.

884
00:33:29,675 --> 00:33:30,707
3½ minutes.

885
00:33:30,709 --> 00:33:32,509
That's it?
 That's it.

886
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:34,244
Some of
  the homemade tomato sauce.

887
00:33:36,915 --> 00:33:38,715
Dig in.

888
00:33:38,717 --> 00:33:40,884
Look at that --
    nice and tender,

889
00:33:40,886 --> 00:33:42,319
cheese coming through.

890
00:33:42,321 --> 00:33:45,822
And I can already hear
 the crunch just from the fork.

891
00:33:47,693 --> 00:33:49,393
The texture's outrageous.

892
00:33:49,395 --> 00:33:51,628
I like the little bit
  of the meatball in there.

893
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:53,096
Tomato sauce
    is outstanding.

894
00:33:53,098 --> 00:33:55,732
But the crunch on the outside --
  crunchy and then creamy.

895
00:33:55,734 --> 00:33:57,567
It's killer.

896
00:33:57,569 --> 00:33:59,236
That right there
    rocks the house.

897
00:33:59,238 --> 00:34:01,204
Thank you.
    You're the bomb.

898
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:02,839
All right,
here's the rice balls.

899
00:34:02,841 --> 00:34:04,174
They're out of this world --

900
00:34:04,176 --> 00:34:06,043
all kinds of goodies
   on the inside.

901
00:34:06,045 --> 00:34:08,678
If you've never had an arancini
  ball, you must try it.

902
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:11,948
You got to come check
this joint out -- real deal.

903
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:13,483
And this guy...

904
00:34:16,989 --> 00:34:18,088
Up next...

905
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:19,322
Wow.
    That is funky.

906
00:34:19,324 --> 00:34:22,859
...the final stop on our
 deep-fried all-star tour.

907
00:34:22,861 --> 00:34:24,094
Whoa!

908
00:34:24,096 --> 00:34:25,429
A Denver, Colorado, dive bar...

909
00:34:25,431 --> 00:34:27,531
One of the best things
  I've seen on "Triple D."

910
00:34:27,533 --> 00:34:30,133
...taking a tot...
 This is the moment.

911
00:34:30,135 --> 00:34:31,968
...and a convenience-store
   classic.

912
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:32,736
Pork rinds in the window.

913
00:34:32,738 --> 00:34:34,838
, out of bounds.
 ...and a convenience-store
   classic.

914
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,106
That might be
   in the Top 10 coolest.

915
00:34:46,118 --> 00:34:48,718
I'm here in
 the Highlands neighborhood,

916
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,221
about a mile from downtown
  Denver, Colorado,

917
00:34:51,223 --> 00:34:53,056
and about a mile away
  from Citizen Pictures,

918
00:34:53,058 --> 00:34:55,625
the folks that happen to produce
"Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives,"

919
00:34:55,627 --> 00:34:57,327
but don't let those details
   confuse you.

920
00:34:57,329 --> 00:34:59,896
I'm here to check out
  a joint that I hear

921
00:34:59,898 --> 00:35:01,665
has the most real-deal,
   off-the-hook,

922
00:35:01,667 --> 00:35:03,567
outrageous bar food
   you can find.

923
00:35:03,569 --> 00:35:05,502
This is Highland Tavern.

924
00:35:09,575 --> 00:35:11,708
Stupid Burger
 in the window.

925
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:14,511
Much more upscale than what
 you would consider a local bar.

926
00:35:14,513 --> 00:35:17,714
Just when owners
 Brian Sommatino and Andy Stutz

927
00:35:17,716 --> 00:35:20,117
had in mind
when they bought this old joint.

928
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:22,986
The building we're in is
 an old Coors Brewing building?

929
00:35:22,988 --> 00:35:24,888
Yeah, built in 1901
  by Coors.

930
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:28,425
It's been a bar pretty much
 from 1901 till now,

931
00:35:28,427 --> 00:35:29,960
minus prohibition.

932
00:35:32,498 --> 00:35:33,997
So, they kept the suds flowing

933
00:35:33,999 --> 00:35:36,867
and hired fine-dining chef
   Jeremy McMinn

934
00:35:36,869 --> 00:35:38,568
to build up the menu.

935
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:41,471
Every dish has a little
something added to it

936
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:43,039
that just makes you
 remember it.

937
00:35:43,041 --> 00:35:44,374
And they hit the jackpot

938
00:35:44,376 --> 00:35:46,776
when Jeremy
  showed he could tackle

939
00:35:46,778 --> 00:35:48,512
the Everest of bar food...

940
00:35:48,514 --> 00:35:49,746
Tavern Tots.

941
00:35:49,748 --> 00:35:51,781
...the homemade tater tot.

942
00:35:51,783 --> 00:35:53,250
Do I need
    to freeze-dry them?

943
00:35:53,252 --> 00:35:54,584
Do I need
    to dehydrate them?

944
00:35:54,586 --> 00:35:55,886
What exactly --

945
00:35:55,888 --> 00:35:58,188
Eventually I just gave up
and we made up our own thing.

946
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:59,923
All right.
 Well, let's see how you do it.

947
00:35:59,925 --> 00:36:02,792
We're gonna cook
 the potatoes.

948
00:36:02,794 --> 00:36:04,828
Cold water.

949
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:08,532
We're gonna bring these up
to just barely a simmer.

950
00:36:08,534 --> 00:36:09,499
Okay.

951
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:11,168
And then even
 the heat out on it,

952
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:12,469
and just let them sit.

953
00:36:12,471 --> 00:36:14,838
It usually takes about 40
minutes until they're al dente.

954
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,972
Al dente -- No, okay.

955
00:36:15,974 --> 00:36:18,141
Yeah, that's probably
a pretty good description.

956
00:36:18,143 --> 00:36:19,910
So, do you have a timer
     on this?
 No.

957
00:36:19,912 --> 00:36:21,011
Awesome.
   No.

958
00:36:21,013 --> 00:36:23,380
So, there's a variable
     here.
  Yeah.

959
00:36:24,917 --> 00:36:25,949
All right.

960
00:36:25,951 --> 00:36:28,351
So, we got our parsley,
    cooked potato

961
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:31,855
that's just cooked enough
 that it'll still make shreds.

962
00:36:31,857 --> 00:36:33,490
Yeah.
    So, hash brown-ish.

963
00:36:33,492 --> 00:36:34,891
Hash brown-ish, yeah.

964
00:36:34,893 --> 00:36:35,859
There you go.

965
00:36:37,996 --> 00:36:41,298
Ooh!
  It's like a snow blower.

966
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:43,033
So, if you're
    a breakfast house,

967
00:36:43,035 --> 00:36:47,070
you would die to have
  hash coming out like that.

968
00:36:47,072 --> 00:36:48,471
A little bit of grit
     to it,

969
00:36:48,473 --> 00:36:50,941
so it's not completely finished,
 and this is the foundation.

970
00:36:50,943 --> 00:36:52,042
That's it.
     I love it.

971
00:36:52,044 --> 00:36:53,843
Now what's the process?

972
00:36:53,845 --> 00:36:55,912
Then we got to mix in
our dry ingredients.

973
00:36:55,914 --> 00:36:57,447
Salt?
  Salt.

974
00:36:57,449 --> 00:36:58,949
Granulated garlic.

975
00:36:58,951 --> 00:37:00,317
Granulated onion.

976
00:37:00,319 --> 00:37:02,552
Cayenne pepper.
      Nice.

977
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:04,588
The key is there's a lot
   of nooks and crannies

978
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:05,655
to all that --

979
00:37:05,657 --> 00:37:08,858
All those different pieces
     of potato,

980
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:12,095
so the more evenly
  you can distribute this...

981
00:37:12,097 --> 00:37:13,997
Okay.

982
00:37:13,999 --> 00:37:16,066
We're gonna add tamari
 to our eggs.

983
00:37:16,068 --> 00:37:17,634
Really?
   Yeah.

984
00:37:17,636 --> 00:37:20,070
So, that little bit of egg's
   gonna help bind it.

985
00:37:20,072 --> 00:37:21,238
Yeah.
     I'm excited.

986
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,273
Are you guys excited
     at home?

987
00:37:24,243 --> 00:37:26,042
Now, we got to form these,
    freeze them,

988
00:37:26,044 --> 00:37:27,110
form them, set them up.

989
00:37:27,112 --> 00:37:28,345
Form them
 and drop them.

990
00:37:28,347 --> 00:37:29,179
Like it's hot?

991
00:37:30,882 --> 00:37:33,883
They will be hot
once we've dropped them.

992
00:37:33,885 --> 00:37:35,151
Okay. What size tot
    do you make?

993
00:37:35,153 --> 00:37:37,520
It's about an ounce
 and a quarter.
       Okay.

994
00:37:39,057 --> 00:37:40,657
Cook them on 350?
  375.

995
00:37:40,659 --> 00:37:42,259
375.
 Till they're GBD.

996
00:37:42,261 --> 00:37:44,394
That's golden brown
 and delicious.
     I pick it up.

997
00:37:45,464 --> 00:37:47,330
A little salt on these.

998
00:37:47,332 --> 00:37:49,299
There it is.
Small order of tots.

999
00:37:49,301 --> 00:37:51,234
This is the moment.

1000
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:57,974
Good separation.
   Looking good so far.

1001
00:37:57,976 --> 00:37:59,609
That's what you're looking for
  in a tot.

1002
00:38:03,682 --> 00:38:07,984
Out of all the house-made tots
     I've had...

1003
00:38:07,986 --> 00:38:09,352
mine included...

1004
00:38:09,354 --> 00:38:11,588
that's the most
    tot-alistic.

1005
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:14,457
This is ridiculous.
   Way to hammer that out.

1006
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:15,392
Thanks.

1007
00:38:15,394 --> 00:38:16,960
In the world
    of "Triple D,"

1008
00:38:16,962 --> 00:38:20,397
that's probably one of the best,
  if not<i> the</i> best rendition

1009
00:38:20,399 --> 00:38:22,065
of a homemade tot.

1010
00:38:22,067 --> 00:38:22,899
Thanks.

1011
00:38:22,901 --> 00:38:24,234
Nice job.
  Thanks.

1012
00:38:24,236 --> 00:38:25,502
And great seasoning.

1013
00:38:27,673 --> 00:38:28,672
Watch out
    for this guy.

1014
00:38:29,708 --> 00:38:33,043
This will ruin tots
  for everywhere else

1015
00:38:33,045 --> 00:38:35,111
because they are really
   just the best.

1016
00:38:35,113 --> 00:38:36,479
We have declassified
     the tots,

1017
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:37,914
and now we are
    going to make...

1018
00:38:37,916 --> 00:38:39,783
Pork rinds
 in the window.

1019
00:38:39,785 --> 00:38:40,984
We're gonna make
 our pork rinds.

1020
00:38:40,986 --> 00:38:42,319
Crazy.
   Yeah.

1021
00:38:42,321 --> 00:38:43,453
Okay.
   Give me the rundown.

1022
00:38:43,455 --> 00:38:44,754
Got some raw pigskins.

1023
00:38:44,756 --> 00:38:46,623
Now, these are pigskins
     from the --

1024
00:38:46,625 --> 00:38:47,924
Belly skin.

1025
00:38:47,926 --> 00:38:50,160
Belly skin, primarily,
is what you want to use in this?

1026
00:38:50,162 --> 00:38:51,528
This is where the bacon
   has been taken out,

1027
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:52,629
just to give you
    some reference,

1028
00:38:52,631 --> 00:38:54,197
and you are now
     going to...

1029
00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:56,766
We're gonna drop this
in some boiling water.

1030
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:58,768
Drop it.
  Drop it
 like it's skin.

1031
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:00,203
Drop it
    like it's skin.

1032
00:39:00,205 --> 00:39:02,072
Great. That's a little
 "Silence of the Lamb"-y for me.

1033
00:39:02,074 --> 00:39:03,807
So, you got to cook this
     through.

1034
00:39:03,809 --> 00:39:05,342
Got four hours
 at a full-on boil.

1035
00:39:05,344 --> 00:39:06,676
Salted?
  No salt.

1036
00:39:09,748 --> 00:39:10,580
All right.

1037
00:39:12,184 --> 00:39:13,750
Wow.
    That is funky, man.

1038
00:39:13,752 --> 00:39:16,553
Now you'll cut them into chunks,
    pieces, strips?

1039
00:39:16,555 --> 00:39:17,787
Little strips.

1040
00:39:17,789 --> 00:39:18,655
Okay.

1041
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:24,394
So, this little
    munchkin dehydrator

1042
00:39:24,396 --> 00:39:25,862
is gonna do
    all the work.

1043
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:27,030
It's gonna do
 all the work.

1044
00:39:27,032 --> 00:39:28,231
How long
    are these gonna go?

1045
00:39:28,233 --> 00:39:31,835
Set it and forget it
for about 26½ hours.

1046
00:39:31,837 --> 00:39:32,902
Not 27?

1047
00:39:32,904 --> 00:39:34,003
Not 27.

1048
00:39:34,005 --> 00:39:35,171
Not 25.

1049
00:39:35,173 --> 00:39:36,072
26.
     26.

1050
00:39:36,074 --> 00:39:37,974
26 and a...
      Half.

1051
00:39:37,976 --> 00:39:39,876
When you dehydrate it
 and take all that moisture out,

1052
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:41,778
that's what gives them
 the chance to really puff up?

1053
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:42,645
Yeah.
     All right.

1054
00:39:43,281 --> 00:39:44,647
Load 'em up,
    shut 'em down.

1055
00:39:44,649 --> 00:39:46,383
26½ hours,
    and here we go.

1056
00:39:46,385 --> 00:39:47,250
That's it.

1057
00:39:47,252 --> 00:39:48,918
Genius.

1058
00:39:50,288 --> 00:39:51,287
Okay.

1059
00:39:51,289 --> 00:39:53,056
They're ready
 to come out.

1060
00:39:53,058 --> 00:39:56,126
Dehydrated pig skin.

1061
00:39:56,128 --> 00:39:57,026
Really?

1062
00:39:57,028 --> 00:39:59,529
Yeah.
 Like, hard plastic.

1063
00:39:59,531 --> 00:40:01,264
So, now we're gonna go
    to the fryer.

1064
00:40:01,266 --> 00:40:03,066
Let's go.

1065
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:08,738
Whoa!

1066
00:40:09,541 --> 00:40:12,142
It's amazing every single time
 you do it, too --

1067
00:40:12,144 --> 00:40:13,176
doesn't get old.

1068
00:40:13,178 --> 00:40:14,878
That is --
    I'm telling you,

1069
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,313
I have seen some cool things
    on "Triple D."

1070
00:40:17,315 --> 00:40:19,649
That might be
   in the top 10 coolest.

1071
00:40:19,651 --> 00:40:21,751
Bring over
   those mouth killers.

1072
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:22,952
Wow.

1073
00:40:22,954 --> 00:40:23,787
Hot!

1074
00:40:25,257 --> 00:40:26,322
Okay. Next.

1075
00:40:26,324 --> 00:40:27,657
We're gonna make
the chili lime-salt mix.

1076
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:29,259
We got our lime salt.

1077
00:40:29,261 --> 00:40:30,360
Korean chili flake.

1078
00:40:30,362 --> 00:40:32,529
Chili powder.
 A little mix.

1079
00:40:32,531 --> 00:40:34,531
Season 'em.

1080
00:40:34,533 --> 00:40:36,599
That's ridiculous.

1081
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:37,634
There you go.

1082
00:40:37,636 --> 00:40:38,668
Look at that.

1083
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:40,804
That's a lot of work,
     buddy.

1084
00:40:47,746 --> 00:40:49,145
Dude, you kill this.
  Thanks.

1085
00:40:50,348 --> 00:40:52,415
This is how they were
    to be appreciated.

1086
00:40:52,417 --> 00:40:56,319
Fresh, crispy, light,
     not dense.

1087
00:40:56,321 --> 00:40:57,887
The flavor jets
    just turned on.

1088
00:40:57,889 --> 00:40:59,322
They're trying
    to shut down

1089
00:40:59,324 --> 00:41:01,224
that flavor fire
    I got in my mouth.

1090
00:41:01,226 --> 00:41:02,425
You want another one?

1091
00:41:02,427 --> 00:41:04,627
Maybe a little Tebow.
   Hang on a second.

1092
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:06,029
That is ridiculous.

1093
00:41:06,031 --> 00:41:07,397
I don't say this often,

1094
00:41:07,399 --> 00:41:10,066
but that's the best chicharrone
    I've ever had.

1095
00:41:10,068 --> 00:41:11,501
Thanks.
 I appreciate it.

1096
00:41:11,503 --> 00:41:13,036
I'm really taken back,
     man.

1097
00:41:13,038 --> 00:41:15,138
I love the pork rinds.

1098
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:17,974
I think they should be
 prescribed to me by my doctor.

1099
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:20,009
One of the best "Triple D"
   experiences I've had.

1100
00:41:20,011 --> 00:41:22,045
That's saying a lot.

1101
00:41:22,047 --> 00:41:23,780
Okay?
     There we go.
  Thanks, man.

1102
00:41:28,153 --> 00:41:30,119
So, that's it
 for this Flavortown road trip,

1103
00:41:30,121 --> 00:41:31,387
but don't you worry.

1104
00:41:31,389 --> 00:41:33,857
There's plenty more joints
  all over this country.

1105
00:41:33,859 --> 00:41:35,358
I'll be looking for you
   next time

1106
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:38,661
on "Diners, Drive-ins
   and Dives."

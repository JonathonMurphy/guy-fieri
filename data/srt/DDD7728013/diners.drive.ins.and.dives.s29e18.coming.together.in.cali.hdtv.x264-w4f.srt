1
00:00:01,635 --> 00:00:03,168
         I'm Guy Fieri,
      and we're rolling out

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:06,605
 looking for America's greatest
  diners, drive-ins, and dives.

3
00:00:06,607 --> 00:00:09,008
           This trip,
  we're making a special visit

4
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:10,709
     to Chico, California...

5
00:00:10,711 --> 00:00:13,479
  I don't think many people know
             how great Chico is.

6
00:00:13,481 --> 00:00:16,281
  ...which lies in the vicinity
        of the deadliest

7
00:00:16,283 --> 00:00:20,019
  and most destructive wildfire
  in California state history.

8
00:00:20,021 --> 00:00:22,454
        Our community and county
        got hit hard right away.

9
00:00:22,456 --> 00:00:23,789
               I mean, we got
             8,000 firefighters

10
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:25,591
                at one point
                on the lines.

11
00:00:25,593 --> 00:00:31,397
        2018's Camp Fire
   scorched over 153,000 acres

12
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:34,400
        and wiped out the
  neighboring town of Paradise.

13
00:00:34,402 --> 00:00:37,202
We came up here during the fires
          to help cook,

14
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:38,771
and we met so many great people.

15
00:00:38,773 --> 00:00:40,272
           That's why we brought
              "Triple D" here.

16
00:00:40,274 --> 00:00:43,242
   To see how this incredible
   community is rising back up

17
00:00:43,244 --> 00:00:46,845
     strong and to celebrate
  its righteous restaurants...

18
00:00:46,847 --> 00:00:48,480
      Way more
than I was expecting.

19
00:00:48,482 --> 00:00:51,083
   ...like a place that rocks
       sweet and savory...

20
00:00:51,085 --> 00:00:52,351
               Well done, man.

21
00:00:52,353 --> 00:00:54,853
     ...a joint going fresh,
        hot, and local...

22
00:00:54,855 --> 00:00:56,321
             Dreamy.

23
00:00:56,323 --> 00:00:59,224
 ...and an Irish pub that thinks
      it's an Asian bistro.

24
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:00,459
 You're taking folks
   international,

25
00:01:00,461 --> 00:01:02,027
 and they don't need
     a passport.

26
00:01:02,029 --> 00:01:03,929
     That's all right here,
           right now,

27
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:06,665
on "Diners, Drive-ins, & Dives."

28
00:01:17,812 --> 00:01:19,445
 All right, Hunter, you hungry?
           -Oh, yeah.

29
00:01:19,447 --> 00:01:22,281
How many places we going to --
   one, two, five?

30
00:01:22,283 --> 00:01:24,083
  Three?
     Slow it down, slow it down.

31
00:01:24,085 --> 00:01:25,751
           The first place we're
      checking out on this Chico

32
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:28,487
     "Triple D" visit is a joint
          where the chef is from

33
00:01:28,489 --> 00:01:29,988
         Boston, but the menu --

34
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:33,292
     well, it's pretty worldwide
     with a big Asian influence.

35
00:01:33,294 --> 00:01:34,560
              You're gonna love
                 this place.

36
00:01:34,562 --> 00:01:36,128
            This is The Banshee.

37
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:39,131
             Put this on first.

38
00:01:39,133 --> 00:01:40,332
               Got some wings.

39
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:42,634
         Banshee is like
    Chico's best-kept secret.

40
00:01:42,636 --> 00:01:44,369
            Is it a bar or is it
                a restaurant?

41
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:46,438
       Mostly, it's a bar
     with really good food.

42
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,574
   Mac and cheese
     for bar 12.

43
00:01:48,576 --> 00:01:50,509
Will's amazing in the kitchen.

44
00:01:50,511 --> 00:01:53,145
     He comes up with things
    you never would think of.

45
00:01:53,147 --> 00:01:55,080
Which are nothing like
   what Will Brady

46
00:01:55,082 --> 00:01:57,716
  was serving at his old joint
       on the East Coast.

47
00:01:57,718 --> 00:01:59,251
    Part of my flaw in Boston

48
00:01:59,253 --> 00:02:02,521
          was having the typical
          lousy, frozen burgers.

49
00:02:02,523 --> 00:02:03,822
 Yeah, it's not just
  a frozen burger,

50
00:02:03,824 --> 00:02:05,424
    it's a lousy,
   frozen burger.

51
00:02:05,426 --> 00:02:07,826
       It doesn't take that much
       to acquire fresh produce,

52
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:09,862
    fresh meats, and give people
             something in Chico

53
00:02:09,864 --> 00:02:11,630
              that they haven't
                 maybe had.

54
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:13,799
     Headline --
"Banshee, Home of the..."

55
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:16,869
          "...Not-Lousy Burger."

56
00:02:16,871 --> 00:02:18,470
     Table 4, Pho-rench Dip.

57
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,038
 The Pho-rench Dip is excellent.

58
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,907
 You get the pho as your au jus

59
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:23,742
      like you would get in
 an actual French dip sandwich.

60
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:25,878
    Two of my favorite dishes
        all in one dish,

61
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,212
     and it blows your mind.

62
00:02:27,214 --> 00:02:29,214
 What are we starting off with?
              The Pho-rench Dip.

63
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:30,482
     "Pho" like
   Vietnamese pho?

64
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:31,950
                      Yes.
      P-h-o.

65
00:02:31,952 --> 00:02:34,119
And then we're gonna make
a meat dip sandwich out of it?

66
00:02:34,121 --> 00:02:35,387
                    Yes.

67
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:36,555
          We're just gonna start
            by making the broth.

68
00:02:36,557 --> 00:02:39,158
      Water, we add a Vietnamese
               soup-base mix,

69
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,425
             our sachet goes in.

70
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:41,593
        What's the sachet
          filled with?

71
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:44,196
        Cinnamon, cardamom pods,
          coriander, star anise.

72
00:02:44,198 --> 00:02:46,165
 Next?
             Jalapeños, onions.

73
00:02:46,167 --> 00:02:47,366
       This would be the braise.

74
00:02:47,368 --> 00:02:49,201
How did we just get to braise
  all of a sudden?

75
00:02:49,203 --> 00:02:50,936
                Well, we have
             like a circular...

76
00:02:50,938 --> 00:02:52,738
 So this is the last
  brisket's broth?

77
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,939
                    Yes.

78
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:55,107
      So you're just continually
              using this broth

79
00:02:55,109 --> 00:02:56,542
 and building flavor
      as we go.
                        Yes.

80
00:02:56,544 --> 00:02:58,477
           What I saw in Vietnam
          was people were famous

81
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:00,846
              for having broths
        that were 100 years old.

82
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:03,282
            Oh, wow.
Getting all fancy
at The Banshee.

83
00:03:03,284 --> 00:03:05,350
                     Fish sauce.
And how long will that simmer?

84
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:06,752
             Just about an hour.

85
00:03:06,754 --> 00:03:08,787
So, now what we have to do
is go make the next brisket...

86
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:10,022
                           Yes.
...to pour the broth.

87
00:03:10,024 --> 00:03:12,324
                        Yes.
       Got it.
We're gonna make a rub.

88
00:03:12,326 --> 00:03:14,826
               Salt, pepper --
         fresh-ground, always --

89
00:03:14,828 --> 00:03:16,428
             Chinese-five spice.
  Whoa!

90
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,896
                  Mix that up.
            Brisket.

91
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:19,131
            Oh, yeah.
          Look at that.

92
00:03:19,133 --> 00:03:20,465
  Trim a little bit
     of the fat.

93
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:22,734
  We dry rub and then we sear it
             in the fry-a-lator.

94
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:24,403
   That's a fryer.
When you're getting fancy

95
00:03:24,405 --> 00:03:25,671
   at The Banshee,
you call it a fry-a-lator.

96
00:03:25,673 --> 00:03:26,905
                   Exactly.
           I like it.

97
00:03:26,907 --> 00:03:28,106
   It's gonna put
a fantastic crust on this.

98
00:03:28,108 --> 00:03:29,208
                    Yes.

99
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:32,110
So, the fried-off brisket
     now gets...

100
00:03:32,112 --> 00:03:33,712
                ...Vegetables
              underneath it --

101
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:35,647
                  cilantro,
             onions underneath,

102
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:38,550
     Thai chilies, some bruised,
              whole lemongrass.

103
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:40,485
       Do you bruise them
          yourself, or?

104
00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:41,587
                  There you go.
      Ow.

105
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:42,921
        That's excessive.
                    That's it.

106
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:44,656
            Brown sugar goes in,
                 jalapeños.

107
00:03:44,658 --> 00:03:45,857
That many jalapeños?
                           Yeah.

108
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:48,894
      Jalapeños tend to mild out
             after a long cook.

109
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:50,662
You got to mild out now.

110
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:53,966
         Ha!
     "Mild out!"

111
00:03:53,968 --> 00:03:57,502
             And we'll finish it
        with our rotating broth.

112
00:03:57,504 --> 00:03:59,338
  Oh, I like this,
it's got good beginnings.

113
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,173
How long's that gonna go?
                      Overnight.

114
00:04:01,175 --> 00:04:02,608
            Now we're gonna make
             pickled cucumbers.

115
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:06,211
   Okay.
            Salt, garlic, sugar,
                 fish sauce.

116
00:04:06,213 --> 00:04:07,946
 I'd have never been
into a bar like this

117
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:09,248
that's running
any fish sauce.
           No. Never.

118
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,183
                 It's maybe
            the best ingredient.

119
00:04:11,185 --> 00:04:12,551
                Chili paste.

120
00:04:12,553 --> 00:04:14,753
  It will sit for about an hour,
         it will be ready to go.

121
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:16,255
  All right, Chef.
    Let's see it.

122
00:04:16,257 --> 00:04:18,890
             First, we toast off
               a French roll.
 Okay.

123
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:20,025
           We got our spicy mayo
    and then we add the brisket.

124
00:04:20,027 --> 00:04:21,393
Nice, big portion.
          Look at that.

125
00:04:21,395 --> 00:04:23,395
                         Onions.
You build a sandwich, holmes.

126
00:04:23,397 --> 00:04:27,699
     Carrots, pickled cucumbers,
some Thai basil, mint, cilantro,

127
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:30,535
  and we're gonna get the broth,
             some green onions,

128
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:31,837
             and some cilantro.

129
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:33,538
Last but not least...
          ...a little chili oil.

130
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,307
      Way more
than I was expecting.

131
00:04:35,309 --> 00:04:38,610
Let me get into this.

132
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,112
           Fantastic.

133
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:41,947
  When you dip it in the broth,
          that's nice.

134
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:44,483
 It's the right bun,
it's the right cut of the meat,

135
00:04:44,485 --> 00:04:46,985
getting that true big,
deep beef flavor in there.

136
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:49,688
The fortified mayo with
a little bit extra of the spice.

137
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,990
When you bring in Thai basil
    and the mint,

138
00:04:51,992 --> 00:04:53,492
     that really
  hammers it home.

139
00:04:53,494 --> 00:04:54,726
  Boom, boom, boom,
     boom, boom!

140
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:56,461
     Delicious.

141
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,263
 I would eat that for breakfast,
       lunch, and dinner.

142
00:04:58,265 --> 00:05:00,465
 "Pho-get" about it.

143
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,034
I got a Pho-rench Dip for you.

144
00:05:02,036 --> 00:05:03,368
      The meat is amazing.

145
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:04,803
      The broth is amazing.

146
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:07,472
   Pickled veggies that meets
   all the right flavor notes.

147
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,007
         Two fish tacos.

148
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:11,109
     Favorite place to come.
           Out of all the joints
                  in Chico?

149
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:12,477
           I mean, there's a lot
      of great restaurants here.

150
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,645
    They have the best food.

151
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,947
And they have a good selection
      of beer.

152
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:17,749
         I've known Ed and Cindy
            since I think I was,

153
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:18,950
           what, 7, 8 years old?

154
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:21,420
  About 7.
     And I'm so sorry, you know,

155
00:05:21,422 --> 00:05:23,488
            with you guys losing
         your house in Paradise,

156
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,158
            but it's interesting
               to see how much

157
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,160
               this community
           supports one another.

158
00:05:28,162 --> 00:05:30,629
     Will really brings that
     community into Banshee.

159
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:33,298
We're hanging out at
The "Fanshee" Banshee in Chico.

160
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,534
When we come back, got anything
else up your sleeve?

161
00:05:35,536 --> 00:05:37,769
             Yeah, we got a --
    I'm worried,
 don't tell me yet.

162
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:39,905
But here's a hint --
  it starts with Asian

163
00:05:39,907 --> 00:05:41,306
     and ends with Mexican.

164
00:05:41,308 --> 00:05:43,141
Two banh mi tacos for you.

165
00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:45,010
     It satisfies every part
        of your palette.

166
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:46,678
I'll see you in a minute.

167
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:52,584
          Welcome back.
 We're at The "Fanshee" Banshee.

168
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:54,519
That's the only way
I'll ever remember it.

169
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:57,022
 The Asian influence
 is out of control.

170
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:59,658
   I spend a good amount of time
     in Southeast Asia and Japan

171
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,126
              and tried to take
          something out of that.

172
00:06:01,128 --> 00:06:03,261
     I love it.
             Banh mi tacos, two.

173
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:05,063
         You have to get
       the banh mi tacos.

174
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:07,966
   It's a Vietnamese sandwich
      basically in a taco.

175
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:10,602
         The Adobo pork,
  it just melts in your mouth.

176
00:06:10,604 --> 00:06:12,604
I see a bunch of chilies,
you taking us to Mexico?

177
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:14,539
              This will be for
             the banh mi tacos.

178
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,508
      We make our own Adobo here
           to rub our pork with.

179
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,609
        Okay.
    Let's see it.

180
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:19,144
              Guajillo chilies.
That have been toasted.

181
00:06:19,146 --> 00:06:21,446
              Pasilla chilies,
               árbol chilies.

182
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:23,315
         This will be pretty hot
      if we put in all of these.

183
00:06:23,317 --> 00:06:24,449
     I love hot.

184
00:06:24,451 --> 00:06:25,717
                 All right,
       then we're gonna be good.

185
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,753
              Charred garlic --
  kind of a Japanese approach --

186
00:06:27,755 --> 00:06:31,356
   charred onions, some red-wine
    vinegar, chipotles in Adobo,

187
00:06:31,358 --> 00:06:33,492
             good bunch of salt,
                black pepper.

188
00:06:33,494 --> 00:06:35,527
    And giving it
 a little hot water.

189
00:06:37,765 --> 00:06:39,097
     Delicious.
      And next?

190
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:41,600
Yep. We're gonna make the braise
             for the pulled pork

191
00:06:41,602 --> 00:06:42,734
            that we're gonna use
             to make our tacos.

192
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,169
Where do the elves sleep?

193
00:06:44,171 --> 00:06:45,270
     That's what I'm saying.

194
00:06:45,272 --> 00:06:46,705
                 This is it.

195
00:06:46,707 --> 00:06:50,475
 Jalapeños, white onions, grate,
       pork shoulder comes over.

196
00:06:50,477 --> 00:06:52,043
How do you want the salt?
                       All over.

197
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:53,412
     And a little pepper inside,
               and we're good.

198
00:06:53,414 --> 00:06:54,446
Shoop, shoop-a-loop.

199
00:06:54,448 --> 00:06:55,914
       This is the sugar plus...

200
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,315
...Seasoned salt?
                      Yes.

201
00:06:57,317 --> 00:06:59,885
Crazy.
            A couple bay leaves,
   Adobo that we just worked on.

202
00:06:59,887 --> 00:07:01,019
            Oh, yeah.

203
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:02,854
                         Water.
   There you go --

204
00:07:02,856 --> 00:07:07,392
   then we'll put it in the oven
for 6 to 7 hours at 325 degrees.

205
00:07:07,394 --> 00:07:09,294
    Bring it out,
let it cool a little bit.

206
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:10,562
            Oh, yeah.
              And then we got...

207
00:07:10,564 --> 00:07:12,898
 Look at that, huh?

208
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,466
  That's delicious.
        Mmm!

209
00:07:14,468 --> 00:07:16,701
 We're just gonna pull these out
               one at a time.

210
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:17,936
               Thank you, sir.

211
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:19,938
We shred this.
     And then we're ready to go.

212
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,707
 So, we have a couple tortillas,
         some nice, crispy pork.

213
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:24,543
 Nice crust on that.

214
00:07:24,545 --> 00:07:25,811
       Is that
  a normal portion?

215
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:27,245
                     It is.
           Spicy mayo.

216
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:29,815
 Spicy mayo that we had earlier,
      some onions, some carrots.

217
00:07:29,817 --> 00:07:31,049
       What do you pickle
       those carrots with?

218
00:07:31,051 --> 00:07:33,285
           Vinegar, sugar, salt,
                 fish sauce.

219
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:35,053
    Pickled cucumbers, cilantro.

220
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:36,188
      That's a heavy dose.

221
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:38,323
          Fresno chilies on top.
Coming in hot.

222
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:40,759
      I would recommend throwing
      a little lime on this one.

223
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:44,329
            That has
      some serious flavor.

224
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:45,697
     Nice little kick, too,
       with those peppers.

225
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:46,698
              Whoo!

226
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,633
When I saw very similar
    ingredients,

227
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:50,469
    well, between
  the banh mi taco

228
00:07:50,471 --> 00:07:54,372
and the Pho-rench Dip, I'm like,
"Mm, lot of similarities,"

229
00:07:54,374 --> 00:07:57,042
but because the baseline
of the Adobo and the pork

230
00:07:57,044 --> 00:07:59,811
    is so forward
in its spiciness and flavors

231
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:02,080
of the dried chilies,
right there you separate.

232
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:04,850
And that's the beauty of a chef
   cross-utilizing

233
00:08:04,852 --> 00:08:08,053
his ingredients -- two dishes,
two totally different results.

234
00:08:08,055 --> 00:08:10,856
            Oh, yeah.
  Fantastic.

235
00:08:10,858 --> 00:08:12,491
     Got your banh mi tacos.

236
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:14,826
      It's one of the most
   tender tacos I've ever had.

237
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,661
You have the richness
   of the pork

238
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,797
     and then the freshness
        of the vegetable.

239
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:20,432
     It's always great food.

240
00:08:20,434 --> 00:08:21,967
             Chorizo quesadilla.

241
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:24,503
  You become an addict, and you
   come back again and again.

242
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:26,605
I think you're taking your chef
 energy and attitude

243
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:29,641
 and just masking it
behind this cool hangout bar.

244
00:08:29,643 --> 00:08:30,909
 You're taking folks
   international,

245
00:08:30,911 --> 00:08:32,410
 and they don't need
     a passport.

246
00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:33,712
       Here in
 Chico, California,

247
00:08:33,714 --> 00:08:35,514
   come on down to
The "Fanshee" Banshee.

248
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:36,581
       And it's not lousy.

249
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:37,916
               And the burgers
               aren't frozen.

250
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:44,723
Up next, an off-the-hook
   bakery café...

251
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:46,191
       Someone knows Flavortown.

252
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:48,059
...cooking up local favorites...

253
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:49,261
              Man, that's just
              hands down good.

254
00:08:49,263 --> 00:08:51,763
        ...including one
     I just couldn't refuse.

255
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:54,299
       She told me that is
      the "Mmm Pork Salad"

256
00:08:54,301 --> 00:08:55,800
         so that's what
       I want to try next.

257
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:01,806
Right now "Triple D"
  is headquartered

258
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:03,441
      in Chico, California,

259
00:09:03,443 --> 00:09:06,211
  which recently became refuge
     to thousands of people

260
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:08,413
      from the nearby town
      of Paradise after it

261
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:11,016
           was ravaged
     by a devastating fire.

262
00:09:11,018 --> 00:09:13,184
         12,500 homes were lost.

263
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:15,320
 It would have been
so much more devastation

264
00:09:15,322 --> 00:09:18,089
   had it not been
for the Cal Fire team.

265
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:19,824
 This is a community
 that's rebuilding.

266
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:21,126
                There's a lot
               of good energy,

267
00:09:21,128 --> 00:09:22,527
             and there's things
              that coming back

268
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:24,129
              to the community
               that were lost.

269
00:09:24,131 --> 00:09:25,897
          But one thing
      that's remained here

270
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:29,167
    is the awesome food scene
  that we've been digging into.

271
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:31,469
 Dad, this umbrella
   is ridiculous.

272
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:35,006
   Listen, it's not the umbrella
  that makes us look ridiculous.

273
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:37,275
         Anyhow, this next place
            I'm taking you to --

274
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:38,944
                this is like
              the Chico staple.

275
00:09:38,946 --> 00:09:40,612
          I mean, it's been here
                for 30 years.

276
00:09:40,614 --> 00:09:41,880
           This husband-and-wife
                    team,

277
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:43,548
              they worked here
              for like 7 years

278
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,950
            and then they bought
                 the joint.

279
00:09:44,952 --> 00:09:46,384
       You ask anybody in Chico,

280
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:49,955
     they'll tell you you got to
      check out the Upper Crust.

281
00:09:49,957 --> 00:09:51,890
I have a California
   chicken ready.

282
00:09:51,892 --> 00:09:54,159
    Upper Crust is definitely
          a Chico icon.

283
00:09:54,161 --> 00:09:55,527
       Pastry platters up.

284
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:58,296
         It's a bakery and café,
      restaurant, almost a deli.

285
00:09:58,298 --> 00:10:00,265
        Like a community
        gathering place.

286
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:02,400
And it's the community
 that lured owners Shelby

287
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:04,235
        and Jeff Plummer
          back to town.

288
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:05,370
        I loved growing up here.

289
00:10:05,372 --> 00:10:07,606
              All of my family
         kind of came back here.

290
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:10,642
     And locally grown chef,
     Ryan Derra, never left.

291
00:10:10,644 --> 00:10:11,910
Bake all your breads,
 all your pastries.

292
00:10:11,912 --> 00:10:14,446
      -Everything scratch.
              -Yes.

293
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:15,747
I'm a cake decorator.

294
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:17,515
   I do all the savory dishes.

295
00:10:17,517 --> 00:10:20,085
I can't imagine people
 who are better at creating

296
00:10:20,087 --> 00:10:22,754
       that local feeling
      with incredible food.

297
00:10:22,756 --> 00:10:25,657
Black bean chili with
a jalapeño cornbread muffin.

298
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:27,525
           I'd die for
      the black bean chili.

299
00:10:27,527 --> 00:10:30,128
     Spicy with this, like,
      sort of pesto on top.

300
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:33,031
      And that muffin makes
    everything come together.

301
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:34,399
The black bean chili's
    a big thing here.

302
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:36,701
If we don't have this,
people legitimately get mad.

303
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:37,602
                 What are we
             starting off with?

304
00:10:37,604 --> 00:10:38,903
 Our cilantro pesto.

305
00:10:38,905 --> 00:10:40,305
        All right, let's see it.
   Cilantro.

306
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:41,673
               Stems and all.
Garlic.

307
00:10:41,675 --> 00:10:43,141
                    Salt.
               Hot sauce, huh?

308
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:47,445
Lime juice and then slowly
add the whole oil to emulsify.

309
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:49,648
   Add our Romano,
   a couple pulse.

310
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,049
      That's it
  right there, sir.

311
00:10:51,051 --> 00:10:52,917
All right, so, now we're
gonna make our jala-muffins.

312
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:53,852
              "Holla"-muffins.

313
00:10:53,854 --> 00:10:55,320
Holla!
                There you go.

314
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:57,222
First, we start with our eggs,
     buttermilk.

315
00:10:57,224 --> 00:10:59,691
       Just a little bit.
    Cilantro, pickled jalapeños.

316
00:10:59,693 --> 00:11:00,759
    Green onions,
some cheddar cheese.

317
00:11:00,761 --> 00:11:01,960
           Thank you.
                  There you go.

318
00:11:01,962 --> 00:11:03,928
      Cheddar.
  Makes it better.
                     I'm jiving.

319
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:06,197
Jack cheese, melted butter --
  set that aside --

320
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:07,932
flour, cornmeal, sugar.

321
00:11:07,934 --> 00:11:09,100
     Baking soda, baking powder.

322
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:10,869
        Salt,
scrape that on in there.

323
00:11:10,871 --> 00:11:12,404
You don't want the gluten
to build up too much,

324
00:11:12,406 --> 00:11:13,505
we want these to where
 you can open them,

325
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:15,040
and the cheesy goodness

326
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:17,275
is the only thing
holding it together, you know?
         How does it go?

327
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:18,677
         Bend the knees
         when you do it.

328
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:20,512
        Just a quick or a heavy?

329
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:21,780
   I'm not trying
 to fry the muffins,

330
00:11:21,782 --> 00:11:24,616
     I'm trying
to bake the muffins.

331
00:11:24,618 --> 00:11:26,351
             You work with him,
                   Hunter.

332
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:27,452
                   Oh, so,
             you're skipping it

333
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:28,853
             because it's gonna
               go muffin top.

334
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:31,856
These are gonna go in at 350
for about 20 minutes.

335
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:33,291
 Now we're gonna do
our black bean chili

336
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:34,526
starting from the dry bean

337
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:36,127
which I've handpicked
 through and rinsed.

338
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:37,395
      You're a very good person.
There you go.

339
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:39,898
    So, the beans come to a boil
        and get nice and tender.

340
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,733
We're gonna do our vegetable
mixture which consists

341
00:11:41,735 --> 00:11:45,770
of onions, bell peppers,
chipotle-garlic mixture, salt.

342
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:48,073
I'm gonna go ahead and toast
 these cumin seeds.

343
00:11:48,075 --> 00:11:50,542
Paprika, basil, oregano.

344
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:51,843
                That's mixed
               into the onion.

345
00:11:51,845 --> 00:11:54,012
We add our vegetable mixtures
    to the beans,

346
00:11:54,014 --> 00:11:55,246
then we add our tomatoes.

347
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:57,148
I'm gonna let it sit
for about 20 minutes.

348
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:01,352
     Open oven.
           That's what you yell?

349
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:03,755
     Every time.
Hunter gets to pick the muffin.

350
00:12:03,757 --> 00:12:05,290
         I want that one
          right there.

351
00:12:05,292 --> 00:12:06,491
                   And what I --
         No, no, no, no.

352
00:12:06,493 --> 00:12:09,160
        The chef was at -- what?
              Dad!

353
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:10,295
             That was delicious.
                    Mmm.

354
00:12:10,297 --> 00:12:11,663
      Nice, little jalapeño bite
                  in that.

355
00:12:11,665 --> 00:12:13,031
            Oh, yeah.
           Little bit of cheese.

356
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:14,499
               Good job, chef.

357
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:16,835
            I'd like to have one
  that's just all crust, though.

358
00:12:16,837 --> 00:12:18,636
           Oh, my God,
      that is so messed up.

359
00:12:18,638 --> 00:12:20,638
             I want
       a different one now

360
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:24,909
The black bean chili here,
cilantro pesto, sour cream.

361
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:27,579
Evidentially, he's dipping
   into your food.

362
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:28,913
           I'm taking
       this away from you.

363
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:31,983
               Be right back.
              Hang on a second.

364
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:35,453
      Here's what I did about it
  is it's good, old-school chili

365
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,388
              with great flavor
           and not overly spicy.

366
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,857
     And that pesto on it...
              That's the kicker.

367
00:12:38,859 --> 00:12:40,458
     ...is what it makes it,
          right there.

368
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,926
 Little sharpness of that garlic
             with the saltiness

369
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:44,262
               of the Romano,
everybody will enjoy this chili.

370
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:46,564
 Now the only thing I want to do
               is take a nap.

371
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:49,901
     Chili is just spot-on.
   Good flavor with the pesto.

372
00:12:49,903 --> 00:12:51,970
        This gentleman over here
       is a good friend of mine,

373
00:12:51,972 --> 00:12:54,806
      the great Dion, the master
           of all black beanery.

374
00:12:54,808 --> 00:12:56,574
Flavor after flavor,
     it's money.

375
00:12:56,576 --> 00:12:58,409
      And with
the swirly-dirly crema.

376
00:12:58,411 --> 00:12:59,544
             "The swirly-dirly."

377
00:12:59,546 --> 00:13:01,479
     You got to
 come down for this.

378
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:03,982
    Chico is a sweet, little
  community with great history,

379
00:13:03,984 --> 00:13:05,750
           and as soon
      as the fire happened,

380
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:08,286
  it just seemed like everybody
  was on-board to do something.

381
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:10,789
Chico basically opened
 up as an evacuation center

382
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:14,392
   for close to 30,000 people
          within hours.

383
00:13:14,394 --> 00:13:17,328
We came up here during
   the fires to help cook,

384
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,963
                 and we met
           so many great people.

385
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:20,498
           That's why we brought
              "Triple D" here.

386
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,635
And one of Chico's greats
  just gave me a hot tip.

387
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:26,538
       I was told by the owners'
            daughter, Charlotte,

388
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,039
                I got to try
         that Korean pork salad.

389
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,974
          -Yeah. Yeah.
         -She brought me
        this nice letter,

390
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:32,443
         and she told me that is
            the "Mmm Pork Salad"

391
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:34,846
               so that's what
             I want to try next.

392
00:13:34,848 --> 00:13:37,348
         It's definitely
      a crave-worthy dish.

393
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:41,452
     We're gonna change the name
to "Charlotte's Mmm Pork Salad."

394
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:43,555
        How's it starting, chef?
With our braising liquid --

395
00:13:43,557 --> 00:13:46,424
throw my garlic in here,
a lot ginger, jalapeños,

396
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:49,394
red chili paste, brown sugar,
     lime juice,

397
00:13:49,396 --> 00:13:51,196
 rice-wine vinegar,
       tamari.

398
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:52,697
                Then you got
            a bone-in pork butt.

399
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:54,265
     Throw it in
 our braising liquid

400
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:56,901
and bake it at 350 degrees
   for two hours.

401
00:13:56,903 --> 00:13:59,337
Once it comes out, we're gonna
hit it with our shredder

402
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:00,572
   and then we got
to make the dressing.

403
00:14:00,574 --> 00:14:01,573
                   Got it.

404
00:14:01,575 --> 00:14:03,708
Lime juice, green onion,
     fish sauce.

405
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,076
                 We're really
             getting after this.
            Oh, yeah.

406
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:07,812
Rice-wine vin, sambal,
 whole lot of sugar.

407
00:14:07,814 --> 00:14:09,747
        And that's the dressing.
We got shredded cabbage.

408
00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:12,283
                   Got it.
Cilantro, basil, mint.

409
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:14,519
             I like those moves.
The dressing that we made.

410
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:15,954
                    Okay.
         Oh, yeah, look at that.

411
00:14:15,956 --> 00:14:19,757
A nice helping of pork on top,
bell peppers, peanuts, cilantro.

412
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:20,959
         And last but not least.

413
00:14:20,961 --> 00:14:22,060
  Crispy shallots.

414
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:24,195
     And here's
our Korean pork salad.

415
00:14:26,099 --> 00:14:27,398
                    Mmm.

416
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,499
           That's just
        hands down good.

417
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:30,001
                 That's like
              lights-out good.

418
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:32,303
        The dressing is rockin',
      a little kiss of the mint,

419
00:14:32,305 --> 00:14:33,938
                nice crunch,
              the pork is hot.

420
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:36,875
          Yeah, it is.
         I mean, it's spice-hot.

421
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:38,343
                Mmm-mmm-mmm!

422
00:14:38,345 --> 00:14:40,178
      I did a little food dance,
                 there, huh?

423
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,312
           You really nailed it,
                    man.

424
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:43,014
                Come on down
       to the Upper Crust Bakery

425
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:46,651
      and ask for the "Charlotte
         Mmm Korean Pork Salad."

426
00:14:46,653 --> 00:14:48,219
      It's crunchy, spicy.

427
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:50,388
This was definitely delivered
on the Flavortown bus.

428
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,657
                  Exactly.
  See, someone knows Flavortown.

429
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:54,259
I'm Not A Reuben ready to go.

430
00:14:54,261 --> 00:14:55,860
     Upper Crust is amazing.

431
00:14:55,862 --> 00:14:57,795
    Truly a Chico experience.

432
00:14:57,797 --> 00:15:00,965
  I don't think many people know
             how great Chico is.

433
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:02,200
We're all connected.

434
00:15:02,202 --> 00:15:03,167
       You should boast about it
             as much as you can.

435
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:04,402
                    We --
        Look, we're on the team.

436
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,337
              We got it going.
               Well done, man.

437
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:08,907
         Thank you, man.
         That's awesome.
 Thank you.

438
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:10,742
Coming up,
  we're headed to a spot

439
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:12,944
      built around a legit
         Italian oven...

440
00:15:12,946 --> 00:15:15,013
        You done eating?
No, I'm not done eating.

441
00:15:15,015 --> 00:15:16,881
...cooking up
 everything from pasta...

442
00:15:16,883 --> 00:15:18,149
             Look at
      those little beauts.

443
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:19,684
    ...to comfort done right.

444
00:15:19,686 --> 00:15:21,085
             This is
      as good as it comes.

445
00:15:25,659 --> 00:15:28,192
Today, "Triple D"
 has been parked in Chico,

446
00:15:28,194 --> 00:15:29,627
   a Northern California city

447
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:31,462
     that sat right outside
          the perimeter

448
00:15:31,464 --> 00:15:34,499
  of the most damaging wildfire
        in state history.

449
00:15:34,501 --> 00:15:36,668
 And as the area builds back up,

450
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:39,137
  we've come here to celebrate
      this strong community

451
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:41,139
       through their local
        restaurant scene.

452
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:43,775
     To round things out, let me
      tell you about this place.

453
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:45,076
       The dude is from Chicago,

454
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:47,378
              moves his family
             out here to Chico,

455
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:51,349
and he's all about farm-to-table
           and wood-fired ovens.

456
00:15:51,351 --> 00:15:53,451
               This is Grana.

457
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,954
           All right.

458
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:58,323
       Grana is definitely
        a star in Chico.

459
00:15:58,325 --> 00:16:00,725
  I think what makes it unique
         is creativity,

460
00:16:00,727 --> 00:16:02,193
    the locally sourced food.

461
00:16:02,195 --> 00:16:04,262
'Cause local is key
  to chef and owner,

462
00:16:04,264 --> 00:16:06,497
          Jeff King's,
       culinary attitude.

463
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:07,498
         I had always threatened

464
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,933
        if I opened a restaurant
                 in Chico...

465
00:16:08,935 --> 00:16:11,135
      "Always threatened."
              ...I'm gonna do it
                 right across

466
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:12,670
                 the street
       from the farmers' market.

467
00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:14,973
           And inside,
   the centerpiece is an oven

468
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:17,809
         he had imported
     all the way from Italy.

469
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:19,744
I'm constantly
 surprised at how they can cook

470
00:16:19,746 --> 00:16:22,413
  such a wide variety of dishes
      in a wood-fired oven.

471
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:24,015
               Two pork ragus
                in the oven.

472
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:26,417
           Today I had
     the braised-pork ragu.

473
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:30,521
    They made this pasta from
 scratch, absolutely fantastic.

474
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:32,423
       What are we making?
              We make our pasta.

475
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:34,859
        Step in, Hunter,
   and show him how it's done.

476
00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:36,227
                     All right.
I'll help out a little bit.

477
00:16:36,229 --> 00:16:37,862
          Caputo flour.
           A little bit of salt.

478
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:40,298
            You know how to make
              the well, right?

479
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,699
             Oh, not like that.

480
00:16:43,737 --> 00:16:47,105
         So, our eggs, mix this,
   make this come together here.

481
00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:48,473
         All right, so,
      we'll let this rest.

482
00:16:48,475 --> 00:16:50,441
   What are we cutting it as?
                    Tagliatelle.

483
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:52,243
   This is the machine that...
That's awesome.

484
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:53,244
     ...cuts them right off.

485
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:54,712
  I love it.
         Bam, bam, bam.

486
00:16:54,714 --> 00:16:56,047
          Look at those
         little beauts.

487
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:57,215
         All right, so,
   let's talk about it, Chef.

488
00:16:57,217 --> 00:16:58,750
       What are we making?
          Braised pork shoulder.

489
00:16:58,752 --> 00:16:59,851
              Okay.

490
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:01,753
             Little bit of salt,
             pepper, olive oil.

491
00:17:01,755 --> 00:17:02,987
   How long are we gonna sear
          this off for?

492
00:17:02,989 --> 00:17:04,555
            5, maybe 10 minutes.
Okay.

493
00:17:04,557 --> 00:17:06,491
            We're gonna use this
            same sheet pan here,

494
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:08,826
              take the mirepoix
   and put it back on this tray,

495
00:17:08,828 --> 00:17:10,094
        sweat this a little bit.

496
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:11,329
      Hot pan.

497
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:13,431
  Porcinis that have been soaked
               and rehydrated.

498
00:17:13,433 --> 00:17:14,599
              Take a little bit
                of red wine.

499
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:16,467
       Oh, I was gonna see
     if he was gonna do it.

500
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:17,668
          Nicely done.

501
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,737
        House-made chicken stock
                and tomatoes.

502
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:20,838
            Gorgeous.

503
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,140
          This is actually gonna
               rest overnight,

504
00:17:22,142 --> 00:17:23,708
         and then in the morning
      when there's no live fire,

505
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,843
   we just use the residual heat
 of the oven to finish the pork.

506
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:27,311
     I love it.

507
00:17:27,313 --> 00:17:29,013
      The last thing we got
        to make is the...
                 ...Salsa verde.

508
00:17:29,015 --> 00:17:30,415
          Salsa verde.
                     Spinach.

509
00:17:30,417 --> 00:17:32,183
        Parsley. Capers.
          Little S & P.

510
00:17:32,185 --> 00:17:33,985
          Lemon juice, olive oil

511
00:17:33,987 --> 00:17:35,920
          from a local olive oil
              producer up here.

512
00:17:35,922 --> 00:17:37,789
              And that's that.

513
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,323
      Okay.
           Delicious.

514
00:17:39,325 --> 00:17:42,560
     After we reheated the pork,
  we'll add the pasta and reheat

515
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,362
              for about another
          three to five minutes.

516
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:48,866
     And that fresh salsa verde,
           Pecorino di Sardegna.

517
00:17:50,837 --> 00:17:54,072
        Mmm!
That was a donkey kick.

518
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:55,973
        Wow.
This is quite the dish.

519
00:17:55,975 --> 00:17:58,176
  For a ragu, it's super light.
And you know what the key is?

520
00:17:58,178 --> 00:18:00,945
That salsa verde, it's
highlighting the ingredients.

521
00:18:00,947 --> 00:18:02,880
I'm getting the wine,
I'm getting a little porcini.

522
00:18:02,882 --> 00:18:04,749
    Outstanding.

523
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:05,917
       You're done eating?

524
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,386
    -No, I'm not done eating.
           -Pork ragu.

525
00:18:08,388 --> 00:18:10,488
   The pork is just excellent.

526
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,356
The salsa verde
  on top adds this nice,

527
00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:15,393
        refreshing sense
    to the really rich ragu.

528
00:18:15,395 --> 00:18:17,128
              Squash agrodolce.

529
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:19,897
  Our buddy, Dino,
is from the famous Granzella's,

530
00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:21,999
a place that I've been going to
 since I was a kid.

531
00:18:22,001 --> 00:18:23,501
What makes this place
     so special?

532
00:18:23,503 --> 00:18:25,503
                 Fresh food,
               stand out, man.

533
00:18:25,505 --> 00:18:27,405
Ladies, how is the pizza?

534
00:18:27,407 --> 00:18:28,940
      There's nothing wrong
            about it.

535
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:31,509
     I like how much detail
        they put into it.

536
00:18:31,511 --> 00:18:34,445
All right, buddy, local farmer,
what do you think of this place?

537
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:35,713
             It's off-the-hook.
   It's my line.

538
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:38,049
              That's your line?
My line.

539
00:18:38,051 --> 00:18:40,251
     Whatever season it is,
there's always something special

540
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:43,421
  on the menu, and the staples
  here are executed flawlessly.

541
00:18:43,423 --> 00:18:45,089
          Chicken leg, table 10.

542
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:47,191
          A chicken leg
     is something different.

543
00:18:47,193 --> 00:18:48,926
        It's better than
        a chicken breast.

544
00:18:48,928 --> 00:18:51,028
           Almost like
      a Thanksgiving meal.

545
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,163
   What's gonna be
     the finale?

546
00:18:52,165 --> 00:18:54,465
           Wine-braised chicken,
             super simple dish.

547
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:57,235
  Chicken right on top of sliced
          onion and lemon, salt.

548
00:18:57,237 --> 00:18:59,203
A little salt and pepper,
   oregano.

549
00:18:59,205 --> 00:19:00,938
                 Olive oil,
    give it a little bit of rub.

550
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,940
       The wood-fired oven
 is running about 650 right now

551
00:19:02,942 --> 00:19:04,375
      so you're gonna go in
       and sear this off.

552
00:19:04,377 --> 00:19:07,945
    Add the white wine, homemade
chicken stock, wrap it up tight.

553
00:19:07,947 --> 00:19:09,647
                 We'll wait
         till the fire dies down

554
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:10,882
             just a little more

555
00:19:10,884 --> 00:19:12,583
          and then we'll give it
            a nice, slow braise.

556
00:19:12,585 --> 00:19:14,552
                  Next up,
             some local polenta.

557
00:19:14,554 --> 00:19:16,020
           Whole milk.
                 And some water.

558
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:18,923
   Once that comes up to a boil,
         add the polenta slowly.

559
00:19:18,925 --> 00:19:20,358
I don't think I've ever used
polenta that fine, though.

560
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,626
    I've not either, Hunter.

561
00:19:21,628 --> 00:19:23,628
    My polenta's always been
      a little more coarse.

562
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,496
              Mmm!
    White cheddar, delicious.

563
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:27,365
 It's great.
          It's grated.

564
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:28,633
     Ba-dum-bum.

565
00:19:28,635 --> 00:19:29,901
     I'll be here all week.

566
00:19:29,903 --> 00:19:31,602
              Salt and pepper,
              red-wine vinegar.

567
00:19:31,604 --> 00:19:34,438
  I've cooked a lot of polenta,
 I've never hit it with an acid.

568
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,707
       I do like the move.

569
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:38,843
    How's that?
             Dreamy.

570
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:40,945
               We'll come back
        with this chicken, nice,

571
00:19:40,947 --> 00:19:42,547
       little roast in the oven.

572
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:43,548
           And it's in the bowl.

573
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:44,749
 Oh, yeah.
        It's in the bowl.

574
00:19:44,751 --> 00:19:46,951
             It's --
        Cinderella story.

575
00:19:46,953 --> 00:19:50,421
     Some of our braised greens,
      chicken, and this our jus.

576
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:51,989
      Oh, just pour it all
        on there please.

577
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:54,292
   I know, please.
    There you go.

578
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:58,162
              Mmm.

579
00:19:58,164 --> 00:20:00,064
     If you can make simple
  chicken taste that dynamite,

580
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:02,266
        that's why Grana
     has such great success.

581
00:20:02,268 --> 00:20:04,302
So little seasoning,
 yet so much flavor.

582
00:20:04,304 --> 00:20:06,037
      That skin crisped up
          really nice.

583
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:07,438
      Oh, yeah.

584
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,040
 Even when you hit with the jus,
     it still stayed crispy.

585
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:10,508
        Great ingredients
           done right.

586
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:11,609
         That should be
          the tagline.

587
00:20:11,611 --> 00:20:13,411
             This is
      as good as it comes.

588
00:20:13,413 --> 00:20:15,346
 We have the chicken
    with polenta.

589
00:20:15,348 --> 00:20:18,416
       Chicken was moist,
      crisp on the outside.

590
00:20:18,418 --> 00:20:20,318
   The polenta is very creamy.

591
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,720
   And then the braised greens
  just bring the dish together.

592
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:25,623
   I would come out of my way
      for Grana every time.

593
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:26,891
     Watch out for this guy.

594
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:28,259
   Unreal.
          Outstanding.

595
00:20:28,261 --> 00:20:30,528
            Nice job.
                      Thank you.

596
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:32,530
    That wraps it up for this
         special edition

597
00:20:32,532 --> 00:20:33,864
 of "Diners, Drive-ins, & Dives"

598
00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:35,666
here in the great town of Chico,

599
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:37,735
       a great community,
         awesome people,

600
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:40,638
 the incredible first responders
   at Cal Fire and Chico Fire.

601
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,673
      And I tell you what,
      the restaurant scene

602
00:20:42,675 --> 00:20:44,375
        is off-the-hook.

603
00:20:44,377 --> 00:20:45,776
   You got to check out Chico.

604
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:47,445
     We'll see you next week
         on "Triple D."

605
00:20:50,216 --> 00:20:53,384
 The way this whole Butte County
        rallied together.

606
00:20:53,386 --> 00:20:55,886
 This was just our way of giving
   you support and telling you

607
00:20:55,888 --> 00:20:57,955
     how much we appreciate
  and how you helped everybody.

608
00:20:57,957 --> 00:20:59,490
So this is our thank you to you.

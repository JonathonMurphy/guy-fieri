1
00:00:01,135 --> 00:00:02,201
           Hey, there.

2
00:00:02,203 --> 00:00:03,669
         I'm guy fieri,
     and we're rolling out,

3
00:00:03,671 --> 00:00:06,705
 Looking for america's greatest
  diners, drive-ins, and dives.

4
00:00:06,707 --> 00:00:07,806
          This trip...

5
00:00:07,808 --> 00:00:08,974
                  Come on.

6
00:00:08,976 --> 00:00:10,676
         ...We're going
   from the bomb breakfast...

7
00:00:10,678 --> 00:00:12,044
    There you go!

8
00:00:12,046 --> 00:00:13,479
   ...To outrageous burgers...

9
00:00:13,481 --> 00:00:15,114
       Crazy!

10
00:00:15,116 --> 00:00:16,815
   ...And dynamite desserts...

11
00:00:16,817 --> 00:00:19,385
               You got an issue.
And that issue's delicious.

12
00:00:19,387 --> 00:00:21,387
     ...Like sugar and spice
           in chico...

13
00:00:21,389 --> 00:00:23,355
      How would
  you attack this?

14
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:25,524
      ...A plethora of pie
          in vancouver.

15
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:28,327
         That really embarrasses
               a lot of pies.

16
00:00:28,329 --> 00:00:29,928
  Plus, in washington state...

17
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:31,397
Rye-t on!

18
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:35,034
   ...Baking plus beef equals
     a crushing combination.

19
00:00:35,036 --> 00:00:37,302
You're putting monster-truck
 tires on a bentley.

20
00:00:37,304 --> 00:00:38,604
        Wow!

21
00:00:38,606 --> 00:00:40,339
     That's all right here,
           right now,

22
00:00:40,341 --> 00:00:42,775
 On "diners, drive-ins & dives."

23
00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:57,122
    So, I'm here in wonderful
       chico, california,

24
00:00:57,124 --> 00:00:59,458
         About two hours
      north of sacramento.

25
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,460
 Now, you know what we don't see
      a lot on "triple d"?

26
00:01:01,462 --> 00:01:02,528
        Breakfast joints.

27
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:03,729
       Oh, we've got them,

28
00:01:03,731 --> 00:01:05,831
        But people really
   get passionate about them.

29
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:08,033
  We had a lot of folks tell us
        about this place.

30
00:01:08,035 --> 00:01:10,035
     You see, this server's
        going to college,

31
00:01:10,037 --> 00:01:11,603
     And she's working here
          at this joint

32
00:01:11,605 --> 00:01:13,806
       And eventually buys
      the whole thing out.

33
00:01:13,808 --> 00:01:15,007
       You got to love it.

34
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:17,242
        All-american town
   with an all-american story

35
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:18,410
     And some rocking food.

36
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:20,012
   This is the sin of cortez.

37
00:01:22,216 --> 00:01:23,549
      Double happiness, up!

38
00:01:23,551 --> 00:01:26,318
  You always know it's gonna be
     fresh, hot, delicious.

39
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,486
        Paleo breakfast.

40
00:01:27,488 --> 00:01:29,354
This is like coming
  to your best friend's

41
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:30,656
     That knows how to cook.

42
00:01:30,658 --> 00:01:32,724
And that good buddy
  is danielle ius,

43
00:01:32,726 --> 00:01:34,026
 Who has been feeding folks here

44
00:01:34,028 --> 00:01:36,929
        At her restaurant
        365 days a year.

45
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:39,865
        Why is everybody in such
   a frenzy about sin of cortez?

46
00:01:39,867 --> 00:01:41,066
 People are used to
  the greasy spoon,

47
00:01:41,068 --> 00:01:42,768
  And we came here,
we made everything fresh.

48
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:43,936
        How did you get involved
                  in this?

49
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:45,270
  I was a waitress.

50
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:46,538
                And you have
               worked your way

51
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,540
             Through this place
        to where you now own it?
Yes.

52
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:50,209
                  Come on!

53
00:01:50,211 --> 00:01:51,677
  Blueberry cornmeal pancakes.

54
00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:53,745
     Danielle's really taken
 breakfast to a whole new level.

55
00:01:53,747 --> 00:01:54,913
- French toast.
- Thank you.

56
00:01:54,915 --> 00:01:56,748
     Cortez french toast is
      one of my favorites.

57
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,650
It's not your usual texas toast.

58
00:01:58,652 --> 00:02:00,352
        It's got cinnamon
       running through it.

59
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:01,487
         It's delicious.

60
00:02:01,489 --> 00:02:03,722
    We're making
our cortez french toast

61
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:04,990
 With our house-made
   cinnamon bread.

62
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:06,792
Everything in this building,
      we bake.

63
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:08,427
   So, here we've
got our yeast rising.

64
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:09,695
   That looks like when somebody
             doesn't know how to

65
00:02:09,697 --> 00:02:11,330
               Do the laundry
  and they put in too much soap.

66
00:02:11,332 --> 00:02:13,765
We'll start with oil.
         Well, that party ended.

67
00:02:13,767 --> 00:02:16,969
                And now the egg?
We're gonna take our flour,
put it in our mixer.

68
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:20,305
I mean, I'm no baker,
but the 2 cups on the floor

69
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:22,074
Probably should stay
    in the bowl.

70
00:02:22,076 --> 00:02:23,709
            Well, that's the sin
                 of cortez.

71
00:02:23,711 --> 00:02:25,611
        Salt, sugar, shortening.

72
00:02:25,613 --> 00:02:26,879
    Is this gonna
   make it all in?

73
00:02:26,881 --> 00:02:28,347
              We're gonna stir
          little bits at a time.

74
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:30,415
So, we let this mix,
    let it proof.
                            Yep.

75
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:32,451
           Now we're gonna make
           the cinnamon mixture.
Okay.

76
00:02:32,453 --> 00:02:34,253
           So, we're gonna start
           with softened butter,

77
00:02:34,255 --> 00:02:35,721
          Brown sugar, cinnamon.

78
00:02:35,723 --> 00:02:37,089
Cinna-minna-minna-minna-mon?

79
00:02:37,091 --> 00:02:39,057
     And then we're gonna slowly
        add the bread crumbs in.

80
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:40,225
     All right,
  how many ounces?

81
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:42,027
                   2 pounds.
87,000 ounces.

82
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:43,128
    I rounded up.

83
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,030
             Fill a whole bunch
        of the cinnamon mixture.

84
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:46,798
        Whoa!
     More sugar?

85
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,133
It's a cinnamon roll?

86
00:02:48,135 --> 00:02:49,535
                   Voilà.
Nicely done.

87
00:02:49,537 --> 00:02:52,938
   Were gonna put it in the oven
          at 350 for 40 minutes.

88
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,306
 That's a big loaf.

89
00:02:54,308 --> 00:02:56,708
       Our batter's a little bit
    more milk heavy than others.

90
00:02:56,710 --> 00:03:00,312
          I'm going to use eggs,
   chocolate, brown sugar, milk.

91
00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:01,680
       You are
  very milk heavy.

92
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:03,882
   Let me see this
cinnamon-roll monster.

93
00:03:03,884 --> 00:03:05,751
I just eat it like it is,
      I mean...

94
00:03:05,753 --> 00:03:08,053
     And this is
a number-one seller?
            One of the top ones.

95
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:10,122
               We make our own
         fresh puree with fruit,

96
00:03:10,124 --> 00:03:11,623
          And then you sugar it.

97
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:15,827
  So, I'm not a big
  breakfast person,

98
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:17,329
      Nor am I
a big sweets person.

99
00:03:17,331 --> 00:03:20,499
When I heard that you were doing
this cinnamon french toast,

100
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:23,035
I thought, "it's gonna be
  too much for me."

101
00:03:23,037 --> 00:03:24,069
    You dumped in
   all the sugar,

102
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:25,704
 And then you dumped
   in more sugar,

103
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:28,040
  But what it's not
    is too much.

104
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:29,441
   It's delicious.

105
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:31,610
There's a lot of things that
shouldn't be working

106
00:03:31,612 --> 00:03:34,947
That really do, like the extra
milk inside of the batter.

107
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:36,548
The density of the bread

108
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,784
Is such that it really
 does need the milk,

109
00:03:38,786 --> 00:03:40,152
  And then it cooks
  on the flat top,

110
00:03:40,154 --> 00:03:42,688
It kind of steams it
so it becomes nice and light.

111
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:43,989
If you like french toast,

112
00:03:43,991 --> 00:03:46,024
 It doesn't get much
more creative than that.

113
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:50,128
My youngest son loves cinnamon
rolls, loves french toast.

114
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,630
    Package deal
  right here, man.

115
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:52,931
   French toast being plated.

116
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:55,033
    It's thick. It's fluffy.

117
00:03:55,035 --> 00:03:56,902
         The adage goes
    "just like my mom made."

118
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:59,338
 Well, no. This is a lot better
        than my mom made.

119
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,439
          Rancho verde.

120
00:04:00,441 --> 00:04:01,673
We love coming here.

121
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:03,742
       It's a really nice
      family establishment.

122
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:06,011
And it became a key
 community gathering place

123
00:04:06,013 --> 00:04:09,581
       When ravaging fires
       hit nearby in 2018.

124
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,083
 One of the reasons
   that we're here

125
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:13,852
Is it was highly recommended
 by the rock family.

126
00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:15,554
I know that you folks lost
     your house,

127
00:04:15,556 --> 00:04:16,955
  And in the middle
   of all of that,

128
00:04:16,957 --> 00:04:18,190
You were taking care
   of other people

129
00:04:18,192 --> 00:04:20,392
 And helping my team
when we came in to town

130
00:04:20,394 --> 00:04:23,328
To support the first responders
  and the evacuees.

131
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:26,431
So, why did you recommend
that I come to this location?

132
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:27,966
           The people are great.

133
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:29,268
            The food is amazing.

134
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,669
           It's very consistent.

135
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:31,670
  It's really good.

136
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:32,738
What's next on the menu?

137
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,373
              Dragon potatoes.

138
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:35,974
       The dragon potatoes
        are my favorite.

139
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:37,342
         It's beautiful.

140
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:40,279
Like a garden on top of the most
    savory potatoes and pork.

141
00:04:40,281 --> 00:04:42,781
          There's some jalapeños
     in there, hence the dragon.

142
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:43,815
        Khh!
                        Yes.

143
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:44,983
   How do you make
    your dragon?

144
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:47,252
                   Wahhhh!
There you go.

145
00:04:47,254 --> 00:04:49,288
That's quite a scary,
little dragon now, isn't it?

146
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:51,923
           Scary, little dragon,
               yes, that's me.

147
00:04:51,925 --> 00:04:54,493
            I'm going to butcher
          our boneless pork butt

148
00:04:54,495 --> 00:04:56,328
              To make carnitas
        for our dragon potatoes.

149
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,596
     We'll do some bay leaves...

150
00:04:57,598 --> 00:04:58,930
               Pepper, salt...

151
00:04:58,932 --> 00:05:00,599
              Cumin, garlic...

152
00:05:00,601 --> 00:05:03,935
                Yellow onion,
              guajillo chilies.

153
00:05:03,937 --> 00:05:07,072
          Cook it for four hours
               at 350 degrees.

154
00:05:07,074 --> 00:05:08,740
     Next step.
                    Black beans.

155
00:05:08,742 --> 00:05:10,542
All right.
                   As soon
           as it begins to boil,

156
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:11,843
               We add the rest
           of the ingredients --

157
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:15,013
         Salsa we make in-house,
      cilantro, a ton of garlic,

158
00:05:15,015 --> 00:05:18,550
    Yellow onions, chili powder,
 cumin, oregano, chili flakes...

159
00:05:18,552 --> 00:05:19,751
    Kitchen sink.

160
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:21,887
     ...Bay leaves, basil, salt.

161
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:23,355
 And how long's this
   gonna cook now?

162
00:05:23,357 --> 00:05:25,624
                 45 minutes,
            till they're tender.

163
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:27,893
Okay, next step.
       Crispy rosemary potatoes.

164
00:05:27,895 --> 00:05:29,227
             We soft boil these.

165
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:31,029
start with putting margarine
    on the grill

166
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:32,297
       And start squishing them.

167
00:05:32,299 --> 00:05:34,232
The old crumble smash.

168
00:05:34,234 --> 00:05:35,734
New culinary technique

169
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:37,069
 We haven't seen on
 "triple d" before.

170
00:05:37,071 --> 00:05:39,137
               Fresh rosemary,
           coarse ground pepper.

171
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:40,205
                The trick is
            with these potatoes,

172
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:42,107
          You do not touch them.
You do not.

173
00:05:42,109 --> 00:05:44,609
      Once they're golden brown,
      you flip them. That is it.

174
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:47,179
          Carnitas, crisp it up.
  And the jalapeños
      on there?

175
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:49,581
Steam those just a bit.
  ah-how!

176
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:53,919
       Rosemary potatoes, beans,
 carnitas and jalapeños, cheese,

177
00:05:53,921 --> 00:05:56,788
  Tomatoes, scallions, cilantro,

178
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:59,157
      Avocado sauce, sour cream.

179
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:02,094
                We gonna take
                our tortilla.
A hurricane went
through here.

180
00:06:02,096 --> 00:06:04,096
                Dragon potatoes.
How would you attack this?

181
00:06:04,098 --> 00:06:05,430
      You smush it all together.

182
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:11,603
I don't know that I've found
many places in the travels

183
00:06:11,605 --> 00:06:14,106
    Of "triple d"
  quite like this.

184
00:06:14,108 --> 00:06:18,110
This is a gigantic deconstructed
  carnitas burrito,

185
00:06:18,112 --> 00:06:20,045
  But you take time
to touch everything,

186
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:21,546
Make sure it's done right.

187
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:24,516
This, for a guy that
doesn't like breakfast,

188
00:06:24,518 --> 00:06:27,552
Is exactly the kind of breakfast
  I'd like to eat.

189
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:28,954
      Dragon potatoes, up.

190
00:06:28,956 --> 00:06:31,123
   Dragon potatoes have a nice
   kick, just enough jalapeño.

191
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:33,425
    There's slow roasted pork
     just the way I like it.

192
00:06:33,427 --> 00:06:36,194
    When you mix that all up
  in the spice, it's fantastic.

193
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:37,362
        Come and get it.

194
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:38,497
I've been coming here
   for 15 years.

195
00:06:38,499 --> 00:06:40,198
     It's just about as good
           as it gets.

196
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,600
 It just makes you feel at home.

197
00:06:41,602 --> 00:06:42,701
 I'm very inspired.

198
00:06:42,703 --> 00:06:44,669
Came here as a waitress,
been running the show.

199
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:47,339
You have a<i> huge</i> following
of people that love you.

200
00:06:47,341 --> 00:06:51,042
The food is unique, spicy,
  crazy, delicious.

201
00:06:51,044 --> 00:06:52,210
I'm pretty impressed.

202
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:53,745
     Well done.

203
00:06:55,616 --> 00:06:58,784
Up next, a scratch spot
 in richland, washington...

204
00:06:58,786 --> 00:06:59,985
     Here we go.

205
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:02,020
       ...Getting gorgeous
      with their salmon...

206
00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:03,955
It tastes even better
   than it looks.

207
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:06,858
      ...And crazy creative
    with a familiar favorite.

208
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,561
That right there is really one
of the most remarkable burgers

209
00:07:09,563 --> 00:07:11,062
I've had in "triple d."

210
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:26,011
  So, I'm here in the southeast
    part of washington state,

211
00:07:26,013 --> 00:07:27,579
 In an area known as tri-cities.

212
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:28,580
     Let's see, it's pasco.

213
00:07:28,582 --> 00:07:30,081
  It's richland and kennewick.

214
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,984
    Now, this area right here
   is a mecca for agriculture,

215
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:35,287
  And I hear about this bakery
   where they're really using

216
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:36,788
    The bounty of the county,

217
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,024
   Scratch-making their goods,
   and they're doing it, like,

218
00:07:39,026 --> 00:07:40,525
       Right in the middle
       of the dining room.

219
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:42,561
  This is ethos bakery & café.

220
00:07:44,198 --> 00:07:45,964
       Stuffed mushrooms,
         chorizo burger!

221
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:49,301
 Ethos has elevated the quality
     of restaurant offerings

222
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:50,469
     Here in the tri-cities.

223
00:07:50,471 --> 00:07:51,470
Shrimp and grits.

224
00:07:51,472 --> 00:07:52,838
          Amazing food.

225
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,373
  Some of the best baked goods
   you can get in the region.

226
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:56,374
             Got a parm chicken.

227
00:07:56,376 --> 00:07:58,343
  Angela is full of surprises.

228
00:07:58,345 --> 00:08:01,947
Like what angela kora was before
 becoming a restaurant owner.

229
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:03,148
            Mechanical engineer.

230
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,483
      You were
a mechanical engineer?
                           Yeah.

231
00:08:04,485 --> 00:08:05,817
      Decided to become a baker,
                  you know,

232
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,486
          'cause people do that.
It's the same thing.

233
00:08:07,488 --> 00:08:08,653
                  Exactly.

234
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,822
    And she's engineered her
        scratch-made menu

235
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,557
  Around fresh and local fare.

236
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:15,727
 This area has such
  strong resources,

237
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:18,230
And to get to showcase
  them is amazing.

238
00:08:18,232 --> 00:08:20,165
    I have a salmon gravlax.

239
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:22,334
    In the pacific northwest,
     salmon is very popular.

240
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:24,836
     And the salmon gravlax
       on the homemade rye

241
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,671
      Is a beautiful dish.

242
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:30,375
   Really fresh, high quality.
          It is unique.

243
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:32,777
All right, so, what
are we making first?
           We're gonna start out
             with our rye bread.

244
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:34,846
        We mill our whole grains
                here on site.

245
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,681
Of course we do.
                   This is
             a turkey red wheat.

246
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,016
         It's an heirloom grain.
Okay.

247
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:39,451
           Switch on this little
                 knob here.

248
00:08:39,453 --> 00:08:41,720
wow!

249
00:08:41,722 --> 00:08:43,121
 Look at that, huh?

250
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:45,924
       This is another rye berry
that's grown just down the road.

251
00:08:47,561 --> 00:08:51,530
So, this is the turkey red wheat
        and then the rye, water.

252
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:52,564
  And the starter?
                            Yep.

253
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:54,332
So, this is natural yeast?
                           Yeah.

254
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:57,903
 You do this about 8 to 12 hours
before you mix your final dough.

255
00:08:57,905 --> 00:08:59,638
     Then mix it
 with more flour...
                         Salt...

256
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,139
...A little more yeast.
                       ...Water,

257
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:04,109
     About an hour bulk ferment,
    and then they're gonna rest,

258
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:05,644
         And then we're gonna do
          a final shape on them.

259
00:09:05,646 --> 00:09:06,645
      Rye not?

260
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:07,979
Proof, into the oven.

261
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:09,514
   It goes for about 30 minutes.

262
00:09:09,516 --> 00:09:12,684
     We start it at 500 and then
 drop it to about 475 to finish.

263
00:09:12,686 --> 00:09:14,419
You know what I have
 to say about that?

264
00:09:14,421 --> 00:09:15,720
Rye-t on.

265
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:17,055
    Rye-t on! Ha!

266
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,290
            This is our gravlax.

267
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:19,891
             We've got this nice
            sockeye salmon here.

268
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,660
            We're just gonna put
             a little oil down.

269
00:09:21,662 --> 00:09:23,862
              Hit it with some
                 lemon zest.
Zest is the best.

270
00:09:23,864 --> 00:09:26,064
             Oh, yeah, totally.
   And then we've got some dill.

271
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,232
             Beets go down next.

272
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:29,200
           We got our dry rub --
        so, this is brown sugar,

273
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:31,736
             White sugar, salt,
           powdered horseradish.

274
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:33,738
I like it.
       Hit it with your dry rub.

275
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,307
    And how long
is this gravlax gonna take?

276
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:37,142
      About 36 to 48 hours.

277
00:09:37,144 --> 00:09:38,710
    Rinse it off?
                       Smoke it.

278
00:09:38,712 --> 00:09:39,844
      Hickory?
                            Yep.

279
00:09:39,846 --> 00:09:41,279
Stove top, not necessarily
   a lot of heat.

280
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:43,815
It'll stay primarily as a raw,
 cold-smoked salmon.
                        Exactly.

281
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:45,317
Let's get it together.
                    Let's do it.

282
00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:47,218
Rye bread.

283
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,020
       So, we're gonna get these
                toasting off.

284
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:50,522
         Just a little balsamic.

285
00:09:50,524 --> 00:09:51,623
          This is a pesto aioli.

286
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,158
Got it.
         We got our salmon here.

287
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,460
    You can see that beet really
          just infused in there.

288
00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:57,929
     Thinly sliced beet, radish,
               pickled onions,

289
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,798
       A little crème fraîche...
Beautiful.

290
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,167
...Fried capers because you need
       a little crispy on there,

291
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:03,535
                  And dill.

292
00:10:03,537 --> 00:10:06,237
Hi, welcome to norway.
      I'm sven.

293
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:09,941
 This is delicious.

294
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:12,310
You want to slow down
   when you eat it

295
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:16,381
To really appreciate the depth
of what went on here

296
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:18,216
 'cause it's exactly
  my mom's set up.

297
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:21,453
It has a really nice,
refined scandinavian feel to it.

298
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:23,188
It tastes even better
   than it looks,

299
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,689
  And that's quite
a picture right there.

300
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:28,159
        Mmm.
     Love this.

301
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:29,427
    Nicely done.

302
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:31,229
     Got two salmon gravlax
           going out!

303
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:32,931
   The rye bread is delicious,

304
00:10:32,933 --> 00:10:36,167
      And the salmon pairs
well with the other ingredients.

305
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:37,602
       You still got that
    veg tartine working, too?

306
00:10:37,604 --> 00:10:38,937
Going down right now.

307
00:10:38,939 --> 00:10:41,106
        Love coming here,
 supporting the local community.

308
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:43,675
   It's so cozy and homelike.

309
00:10:43,677 --> 00:10:45,644
      I like that they put
     the glass windows here.

310
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:47,345
              Do you come here
           for the stadium show?

311
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:49,781
   It's wonderful --
     the smell.
                          Crazy.

312
00:10:49,783 --> 00:10:50,949
  And on top of the whole thing,
               it's all fresh.

313
00:10:50,951 --> 00:10:53,752
You can get fresh bread
from a drive-through.

314
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:56,354
 They've got all of your dining
needs covered for the whole day.

315
00:10:56,356 --> 00:10:58,423
 So, now we're gonna
change gears, though...
                            Yep.

316
00:10:58,425 --> 00:11:00,325
...From the artisan style
  to the indulgent.

317
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:02,594
         An ethos burger
    with sweet potato chips.

318
00:11:02,596 --> 00:11:04,129
You've got to see this!

319
00:11:04,131 --> 00:11:05,730
   This burger is incredible.

320
00:11:05,732 --> 00:11:06,931
        Coming up next...

321
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:09,834
That is one of the most
outside-of-the-box burgers

322
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,169
    I've ever had
   on "triple d."

323
00:11:18,745 --> 00:11:20,311
    Gingerbread?
                Yep, you got it.

324
00:11:20,313 --> 00:11:22,347
     Gingerbread
  or a ninja star?

325
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:23,448
  You be the judge.

326
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:26,484
"triple d" is scratch-baking...

327
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:28,019
             Can I get some buns
        from the bakery, please?

328
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:29,220
      ...And homemaking...

329
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:31,156
          Two stuffed mushrooms,
             two gravlax salmon.

330
00:11:31,158 --> 00:11:34,793
    ...At ethos bakery & café
    in richland, washington.

331
00:11:34,795 --> 00:11:36,961
      Ethos does elevated,
          amazing food.

332
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:39,297
     Perfect for breakfast,
         lunch, dinner.

333
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:40,732
 Got an ethos burger going out.

334
00:11:40,734 --> 00:11:43,468
I have trouble ordering anything
   else but the ethos burger.

335
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:47,639
   It has this super buttery,
      flaky croissant bun.

336
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:49,941
The bacon topping
  with the braised leeks

337
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:52,343
          Just takes it
       to the next level.

338
00:11:52,345 --> 00:11:53,912
What's the game plan?
          This is our croissant.

339
00:11:53,914 --> 00:11:56,815
         So, get your milk going
         and the yeast in there,

340
00:11:56,817 --> 00:11:59,951
    Sugar and salt, and then
 we'll pour that into the bowl.

341
00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:01,186
            Put your flour in...

342
00:12:01,188 --> 00:12:02,387
       Got it.
                      ...Butter.

343
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:03,788
And then the starter?
                   That's right.

344
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,156
So, this gets mixed up
    for how long?

345
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:06,624
            Probably 10 minutes.

346
00:12:06,626 --> 00:12:09,160
     Let it rest, and then we're
    gonna get ready to laminate.

347
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:10,729
     Here we go.

348
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:12,964
         Butter is just gonna go
  right in the middle like that.

349
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:14,933
Sheet it out.

350
00:12:14,935 --> 00:12:17,869
I'd sit here and play
 with this all day.
       And then we do tri-folds.

351
00:12:17,871 --> 00:12:20,238
        So this is one, so we're
     gonna do it two more times.

352
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,740
                 And then --

353
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:23,508
Into the fridge, rest.
                            Yes.

354
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,076
              I'm gonna roll it
                  out here.

355
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,779
It is just layers of magic.

356
00:12:27,781 --> 00:12:30,215
                Our buns are
2 inches by 12 inches rolled up.

357
00:12:30,217 --> 00:12:31,983
 You let that proof,
    bake it off.

358
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:34,385
        Then they're ready to go
                for service.
You are busy people.

359
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:36,421
All right, next step --
the bacon vinaigrette...
                            Yes.

360
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:38,289
 ...That's going on
 top of the burger.
                        Correct.

361
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,558
      We've just got some oil in
  there, and you got your bacon,

362
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,160
       And that's just gonna get
               rendered down.

363
00:12:42,162 --> 00:12:44,229
        So, then we're gonna get
 the base going on the dressing.

364
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:46,464
       Some brown sugar in here,
                maple syrup,

365
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:48,333
            Apple cider vinegar,
              salt and pepper,

366
00:12:48,335 --> 00:12:49,634
              And then you got
               your bacon fat.

367
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:51,169
  Now, that's what
 I'm talking about.

368
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:55,140
Oh, yeah.
              And then you got
             rosemary in there,

369
00:12:55,142 --> 00:12:57,342
       And then the crispy bacon
      right in there at the end.

370
00:12:57,344 --> 00:12:58,777
       Uh-huh!
      Bring it.

371
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:00,478
                 We got our
            nice 8-ounce burger.

372
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,380
     Good amount
 of salt and pepper.

373
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:03,815
You're gonna mark it
    on the grill

374
00:13:03,817 --> 00:13:05,583
 And then finish it
    in the oven?
         Throw some aromatics --

375
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:07,452
              Rosemary, thyme,
             and then butter --

376
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:08,720
             And then it goes on
                in the oven.

377
00:13:08,722 --> 00:13:10,421
      Sit there
  and baste in it.
                   That's right.

378
00:13:10,423 --> 00:13:11,656
                 It gets hit
             with white cheddar.

379
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:13,024
 It's gonna kill me.
   You know that.

380
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:15,493
And this is
our monster --
                  croissant bun.

381
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:16,761
            See that nice layers
                right there.

382
00:13:16,763 --> 00:13:17,762
        Wow!

383
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:19,597
       Crazy.

384
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:20,899
     Mark them off a little bit,

385
00:13:20,901 --> 00:13:22,967
        And then you want to get
           your bacon vin going.

386
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:24,936
        Get some leeks in there,
                  as well.

387
00:13:24,938 --> 00:13:27,806
 We sauté these with white wine,
              salt and pepper.

388
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:29,674
 We got our croissant bun that's
    been all toasted off, right?

389
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:31,976
 Sweet potato chips.
                    Burger down.

390
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:34,245
        Some ooey-gooey goodness
                right on top.

391
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:36,981
               There you go --
                ethos burger.

392
00:13:43,023 --> 00:13:44,022
That's a real croissant.

393
00:13:44,024 --> 00:13:45,757
I mean, that's, like,
      textbook.

394
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:50,195
You are taking this delicious,
   angelic pastry

395
00:13:50,197 --> 00:13:52,897
   And hitting it
   with a burger.

396
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:55,900
You're putting monster-truck
 tires on a bentley.

397
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,737
And I would take that
to the county fairgrounds

398
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:01,806
   For race night
any day of the week.

399
00:14:01,808 --> 00:14:04,075
wow!

400
00:14:04,077 --> 00:14:07,946
That is one of the most
outside-of-the-box burgers

401
00:14:07,948 --> 00:14:09,380
    I've ever had
   on "triple d."

402
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:10,949
I've had hundreds.

403
00:14:10,951 --> 00:14:12,483
    The croissant
   holds together.

404
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:14,285
   It soaks it up.

405
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:15,920
    The burger's
  cooked perfectly.

406
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:17,722
  The white cheddar
was the perfect kiss.

407
00:14:17,724 --> 00:14:22,026
But it's this leek- and
bacon-vinaigrette jam fest

408
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:23,461
That you put on there.

409
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:25,964
     Oh, my god!
      Amazing.

410
00:14:25,966 --> 00:14:26,931
                  Awesome.
Wow.

411
00:14:26,933 --> 00:14:28,366
   We got three ethos burgers
            all day.

412
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:30,668
  It's a wonderful combination
           of flavors.

413
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,470
It's literally a bite of heaven.

414
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:33,671
   Got that shrimp and grits.

415
00:14:33,673 --> 00:14:35,073
     I don't know of a place
           like this.

416
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:36,975
      You get to have food
      from your community.

417
00:14:36,977 --> 00:14:38,142
       We really enjoy it.

418
00:14:38,144 --> 00:14:41,212
   It's delicious.
Your enthusiasm is contagious.

419
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:43,548
Your attention to detail coming
from your engineer background,

420
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,716
I now understand it.

421
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:46,551
And that right there
      is really

422
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:48,086
   One of the most
 remarkable burgers

423
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:50,088
I've had in "triple d."

424
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,089
      Good job.
                      Thank you.

425
00:14:51,091 --> 00:14:53,625
"engineer," yeah, right.

426
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:57,128
Coming up...

427
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,897
 A place in vancouver, canada...

428
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:01,432
    I thought that was the crown
            of the pie princess.

429
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:02,533
      ...Going from meat...

430
00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:03,768
   All cheeseburger, all day.

431
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,069
          ...To sweet.

432
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:06,804
             That's like calling
  the space shuttle an airplane.

433
00:15:17,684 --> 00:15:19,183
          So, I'm here
      in vancouver, canada.

434
00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:21,219
       Now, on "triple d,"
        we have fulfilled

435
00:15:21,221 --> 00:15:23,121
            The menu
    of all of your favorites.

436
00:15:23,123 --> 00:15:24,622
   Oh, we've given you pizza,

437
00:15:24,624 --> 00:15:25,757
    We've given you burgers,

438
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:27,358
       Given you hot dogs,
       given you burritos.

439
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,994
  We've given you chinese food,
   mexican food, italian food.

440
00:15:29,996 --> 00:15:31,930
Oh, we've given you comfort food
        and ethnic food.

441
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:33,831
             I mean,
  we have really done our job,

442
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:36,000
 But then you write in, and you
    say, "you know what, guy?

443
00:15:36,002 --> 00:15:37,602
  You know what we want? Pies."

444
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:39,404
  That's a pie-in-the-sky idea.

445
00:15:39,406 --> 00:15:41,105
      This is the pie hole.

446
00:15:43,743 --> 00:15:45,243
            I've got
    your chunky-monkey slice.

447
00:15:45,245 --> 00:15:46,911
     The food is delicious.

448
00:15:46,913 --> 00:15:49,781
          What do you recommend?
    Oh, my gosh.
What's my mood today?

449
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:51,716
 I just want one of everything.

450
00:15:51,718 --> 00:15:54,385
And thanks to owner
 jenell parsons' creative mind,

451
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:57,155
   There's more than 100 pies
         to choose from.

452
00:15:57,157 --> 00:15:59,123
   I've got a 3-d
computer animation degree.

453
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:02,160
   I'm an artist,
so for me, pie is art.

454
00:16:02,162 --> 00:16:05,229
      And her master works
   are both sweet and savory.

455
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:07,165
     Two bacon-cheeseburger
           hand pies.

456
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:11,536
 She put everything great about
a bacon cheeseburger into a pie.

457
00:16:11,538 --> 00:16:13,805
   I'd honestly prefer it over
      a bacon cheeseburger.

458
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:14,872
           It's great.

459
00:16:14,874 --> 00:16:16,674
        The basis of a great pie
                 is the...?

460
00:16:16,676 --> 00:16:17,976
Crust.
                 All right,
                let's see it.

461
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:20,478
So, what we start with
is all-purpose flour, sugar,

462
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,081
Salt, unsalted cold butter,
  and that's, like,

463
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:26,150
  The tip to making
the flaky, buttery layers.

464
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:29,554
      Never in my life seen that
     much butter-to-flour ratio.

465
00:16:29,556 --> 00:16:31,689
            You've got an issue.
And that ish delicious.

466
00:16:31,691 --> 00:16:33,825
I bet it is.

467
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:35,893
  Water. Keep that
as ice-cold as possible.

468
00:16:35,895 --> 00:16:37,362
      Vinegar.
                   Why the acid?

469
00:16:37,364 --> 00:16:38,930
The acid's gonna help
break down the gluten,

470
00:16:38,932 --> 00:16:40,765
And that's gonna help
give you the flaky layers.

471
00:16:40,767 --> 00:16:41,799
Now we're gonna make
     the filling

472
00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:42,867
For the bacon cheeseburger.
                         Got it.

473
00:16:42,869 --> 00:16:44,602
    Ground beef.
 Brown the meat up.

474
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:46,471
  Add in the flour,
     then milk.

475
00:16:46,473 --> 00:16:47,772
        We're gonna build a roux
               out of the fat?

476
00:16:47,774 --> 00:16:49,040
Kind of gonna build a roux
   out of the fat

477
00:16:49,042 --> 00:16:50,274
Right into the pot here.

478
00:16:50,276 --> 00:16:51,342
  A little mustard.

479
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:52,643
                 Got to have
            the american cheese.

480
00:16:52,645 --> 00:16:54,212
And then the pickles
give you a little bit of bite.

481
00:16:54,214 --> 00:16:55,847
           So, you're gonna have
         the reminiscent flavors

482
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:57,281
         That everybody expects.
You bet.

483
00:16:57,283 --> 00:16:58,783
                  And then
           last but not least --

484
00:16:58,785 --> 00:17:00,418
          A little salt, pepper,
                   and...?

485
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,486
    A little bit
  of white pepper.

486
00:17:01,488 --> 00:17:02,620
             Living on the edge.
Yep.

487
00:17:02,622 --> 00:17:04,655
We're gonna roll this now
  that it's rested.

488
00:17:04,657 --> 00:17:05,923
  We have a trusty
    little ring.

489
00:17:05,925 --> 00:17:08,292
    I thought that was the crown
            of the pie princess.

490
00:17:08,294 --> 00:17:10,061
 Well, it could be.

491
00:17:10,063 --> 00:17:11,396
We're gonna put a little bit
  of our egg wash.

492
00:17:11,398 --> 00:17:12,830
  This is gonna act
   like the glue,

493
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:14,766
And we've got our filling
that's now been cooled.

494
00:17:14,768 --> 00:17:16,434
        Two scoops, so it's like
               a double patty.

495
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:18,803
Then we're gonna add
 some cheese, bacon,

496
00:17:18,805 --> 00:17:20,338
  Onions, mustard,

497
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,440
   And then we got
 to close these up.
            Good luck with that.

498
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:24,509
                 So, that's
         the super crimper 9000?

499
00:17:24,511 --> 00:17:27,678
The egg wash is what gives
you that gorgeous color.
                      The sheen.

500
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:31,416
Steam has to escape.
           A little sesame seed.
              Oh, I like this.

501
00:17:31,418 --> 00:17:32,450
What temp?
  How long?

502
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:35,219
350,
   about 35, 40 minutes.

503
00:17:37,924 --> 00:17:38,990
               It's delicious.

504
00:17:38,992 --> 00:17:40,458
             It tastes just like
               a cheeseburger.

505
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,428
              The pie crust --
     flaky is an understatement.

506
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,830
               Do not eat this
                  in black.

507
00:17:45,832 --> 00:17:47,265
              All cheeseburger,
                  all day.

508
00:17:47,267 --> 00:17:49,834
     I mean, there's no question
          why that's such a hit.

509
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:52,870
             Good portions, nice
 presentation, and very mindful.

510
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:54,272
     Thank you.

511
00:17:54,274 --> 00:17:56,107
So, as soon as you bite in,
  you get the meaty taste

512
00:17:56,109 --> 00:17:58,409
    But then also the pickles
        and the mustard.

513
00:17:58,411 --> 00:17:59,444
           Perfection.

514
00:17:59,446 --> 00:18:00,778
           I can make pie crust,

515
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,214
              But I can't make
            pie crust like this.
Not this good.

516
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:05,783
 I mean, this is --
there's something going on here.
              There's something.

517
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:08,886
The place is just so fun
  and just makes you feel

518
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:10,955
   Really comfortable as soon
    as you walk in the door.

519
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:14,559
      You have a neon that says,
          "stuff your pie hole."
yes.

520
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:16,794
       Probably the coolest sign
      I've ever seen in my life.

521
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:18,129
            I'm not kidding you.

522
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:20,565
Out of the 1,100-plus "triple d"
         joints we've ever done,

523
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:23,267
               "the pie hole,"
               best name ever.

524
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,369
And one of jenell's best
   pies is the one

525
00:18:25,371 --> 00:18:28,072
       She says customers
       are obsessed with.

526
00:18:28,074 --> 00:18:29,974
Got a raspberry cream
 crumble sliced up.

527
00:18:29,976 --> 00:18:31,542
           It's sweet.
           It's tart.

528
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:33,010
          It's perfect.

529
00:18:33,012 --> 00:18:35,313
We're gonna make the custard
for the raspberry cream pie.

530
00:18:35,315 --> 00:18:36,781
Start with some eggs.

531
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:38,716
      I mean, I don't like eggs,
   but if they look like that --

532
00:18:38,718 --> 00:18:40,718
They're organic. They're local.
  They're free-run.

533
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,420
They're the happiest
chickens you can find.

534
00:18:42,422 --> 00:18:45,089
We're gonna add some
 sour cream, sugar,

535
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:48,259
     Some flour,
vanilla, and some salt.
                         Got it.

536
00:18:48,261 --> 00:18:49,327
        Okay.
                           Next.

537
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:50,962
  We're gonna make
  the crumble next.

538
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:54,232
We've got butter,
flour, and sugar.
                Break it down
              into the gravel.

539
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:55,566
                 Same crust.

540
00:18:55,568 --> 00:18:58,136
And I just use the pie plate
   as my template.

541
00:18:58,138 --> 00:18:59,937
               Look how thick
               that crust is.

542
00:18:59,939 --> 00:19:02,006
  And now is doing
 the beautiful edge.

543
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:03,407
Do you want to do it?
                   Oh, yeah, no.

544
00:19:04,711 --> 00:19:06,144
               It's gorgeous,
                 by the way.

545
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:07,645
  My term for this
     is forking.

546
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,347
          Okay, but you dock it.
But you dock it.

547
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:10,548
                Good berries.

548
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:12,683
   Nice, eh?
     Mmm.
                 Don't you know.

549
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:14,886
            That's how many goes
                  in this?
Yeah.

550
00:19:14,888 --> 00:19:17,588
We've got our custard.
                      Holy moly.

551
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,056
    I thought there was gonna be
              some raspberries.

552
00:19:19,058 --> 00:19:20,958
 I didn't think there were gonna
           be 8,000 raspberries.

553
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,493
  You can't call it
a raspberry cream pie

554
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,761
If you don't fill it
  right up, right?

555
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:24,962
           Yeah, don't you know?

556
00:19:24,964 --> 00:19:27,765
And then this beautiful
  buttery crumble.

557
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:29,033
                 All right.
We bake them on a tray

558
00:19:29,035 --> 00:19:30,635
Because the raspberries
  are gonna burst.

559
00:19:30,637 --> 00:19:33,104
If a pie is not oozing
over the edge, it's not a pie.

560
00:19:33,106 --> 00:19:34,906
Because this one is so big,

561
00:19:34,908 --> 00:19:36,007
We're gonna be putting this
     in the oven

562
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:37,441
For almost two hours.

563
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:38,943
                Really? 350?

564
00:19:38,945 --> 00:19:40,611
                 We're out.
                We're cooled.

565
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:42,113
Get our big old knife.

566
00:19:42,115 --> 00:19:44,315
             What's that method
                right there?
This method?

567
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:46,217
It's the stabby method.
               Eeh, eeh, eeh!

568
00:19:48,221 --> 00:19:49,687
    There you go.

569
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:55,693
             That is so far past
                what I think

570
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:58,696
             The average person
         would call a berry pie.

571
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:01,232
             That's like calling
  the space shuttle an airplane.

572
00:20:01,234 --> 00:20:03,501
        That's a whole different
                level of pie.

573
00:20:03,503 --> 00:20:06,704
          The crust is as tender
               and as crunchy

574
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:08,739
                And as moist
             as a butter cookie.

575
00:20:08,741 --> 00:20:12,009
     But the cream with the eggs
     and the sugar and the flour

576
00:20:12,011 --> 00:20:13,978
             And the sour cream
 with that little bit of tang...

577
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,413
        Yeah.

578
00:20:15,415 --> 00:20:18,049
     ...And then all those fresh
berries that have cooked down --

579
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:21,619
        I mean, you made the jam
   right inside of the pie. Wow.

580
00:20:21,621 --> 00:20:25,756
         Not only does it change
   my expectation of berry pies,

581
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:27,592
       It changed my expectation
            for pies in general.

582
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:29,860
         That really embarrasses
               a lot of pies.

583
00:20:29,862 --> 00:20:31,796
Raspberry cream crumble.

584
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:33,130
          It's creamy.

585
00:20:33,132 --> 00:20:35,166
      It's got the tartness
         of raspberries.

586
00:20:35,168 --> 00:20:37,101
     The crumble on the top
      is my favorite part.

587
00:20:37,103 --> 00:20:38,302
         It'll ruin you forever.

588
00:20:38,304 --> 00:20:40,104
It will ruin you forever.

589
00:20:40,106 --> 00:20:41,539
   You going sweet
     or savory?

590
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:44,442
 Every time I step in, it's just
    like walking into heaven.

591
00:20:44,444 --> 00:20:46,477
                 From having
              100-plus recipes

592
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:48,446
             And what people get
             in the experience,

593
00:20:48,448 --> 00:20:49,947
                I don't know
          where your ceiling is.

594
00:20:49,949 --> 00:20:51,148
  Oh, goose bumps.

595
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:53,017
                 Well done.
Thank you.

596
00:20:54,654 --> 00:20:57,455
      So, was that another
  righteous road trip or what?

597
00:20:57,457 --> 00:20:58,856
      But don't you worry.

598
00:20:58,858 --> 00:21:01,525
    We got plenty more joints
 to find all over this country.

599
00:21:01,527 --> 00:21:03,127
     I'll be looking for you
            next week

600
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:05,563
 On "diners, drive-ins & dives."

601
00:21:05,565 --> 00:21:07,498
When a job makes you cry,
    you walk out

602
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,334
Because life is too short
to be miserable, and --

603
00:21:10,336 --> 00:21:12,069
I got to go!
  Don't.
No, come back.

604
00:21:12,071 --> 00:21:13,871
Come back. Come back.
          I can't do it anymore.

605
00:21:13,873 --> 00:21:16,073
Just kidding.

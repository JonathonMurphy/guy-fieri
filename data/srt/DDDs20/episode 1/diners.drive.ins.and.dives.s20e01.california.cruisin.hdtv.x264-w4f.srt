              Make sure it all

               it's a Kahlua.

203
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,692
      It's two days to marinate.

204

You added liquid smoke

238
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:37,155
 because typically,
this is cooked in a pit,

239
00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:39,124
so you're getting a little bit
of that smoke imparted into it.

  about how good everything is.

274
00:09:07,114 --> 00:09:09,314
      Chamorro ready to go.

275
00:09:09,316 --> 00:09:11,550
  Every bite is a magical bite.

276
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:12,951
          It's perfect.

277
00:09:12,953 --> 00:09:15,053
Really has the sazón of
the family, and you really --

278
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:16,521
                 The sazón.
  Sazón.

279
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:18,390
The flavor of the family.

280
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:21,192
             FIERI:
 That would be the Muñoz family,

281
00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:23,929
   with veteran chef papa Tito
       leading the charge.

282
00:09:23,931 --> 00:09:25,463
           Have you always been
         this close of a family?

283
00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:26,965
                All the time.

284
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:29,100
                We always did
       a lot of things together.

285
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:32,871
     Like taking the plunge
 and opening this joint in 2012

286
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:35,473
           with a menu
     based on Mom's recipes.

287
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:38,410
 WOMAN: This food is delicious,
   it's fresh, it's flavorful.

288
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:40,245
     You just can't go wrong
         with anything.

289
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:42,080
      What's your favorite thing
                 on the menu?
           The tamale.

290
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:45,116
       Pork tamale ready.

291
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:47,052
         It's the best.

292
00:09:47,054 --> 00:09:48,053
       We're gonna make tamales.

293
00:09:48,055 --> 00:09:49,087
      Tamales.

294
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:51,089
          I'm gonna do the pork.
   Pork tamale.

295
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:53,058
     So, we're gonna put in a --

296
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,293
      Pork butt
that's been just cut up.

297
00:09:55,295 --> 00:09:58,096
            Cook it in the water
               with some salt,

298
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:01,066
                some onions,
              Mexican oregano.

299
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:03,034
                   garlic,
               and bay leaves.

300
00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:04,502
And we're just gonna
    cook it down?

301
00:10:04,504 --> 00:10:05,670
                Cook it down.

302
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:07,539
  The rest of this
   goes in there?
                           Yes.

303
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:09,240
                Mexican oregano.
  Okay.

304
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:11,276
                   Black pepper.
 Black peppercorns.
       Got it.

305
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:13,478
  The onion.
                 Onions. Garlic.

306
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,013
                          Cumin.
Cumin seeds. Got it.

307
00:10:15,015 --> 00:10:17,415
                  Allspice.
Then we're gonna put some water.

308
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:18,650
                Where's my --

309
00:10:18,652 --> 00:10:19,884
Well, why don't we put the water
  from the peppers?

310
00:10:22,723 --> 00:10:23,955
What does "Sabroso" mean?

311
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:25,190
                 Delicious.

312
00:10:25,192 --> 00:10:26,825
      Sabroso.

313
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:31,730
               We're gonna add
                the peppers.

314
00:10:31,732 --> 00:10:34,199
             That's the guajillo
               and California.

315
00:10:34,201 --> 00:10:35,934
   Chile de arbol.

316
00:10:37,537 --> 00:10:39,004
        Okay.

317
00:10:39,006 --> 00:10:40,905
      Now we go
   to the hot oil?
                          Yes.

318
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:43,842
Got to strain it a little bit
'cause there's some solid.

319
00:10:43,844 --> 00:10:45,710
   Oh, that sauce.

320
00:10:45,712 --> 00:10:48,647
 My mouth is just --
the flavor jets are turning on.

321
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:49,981
How long is that gonna cook,
        chef?

322
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,349
                 20 minutes.

323
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:52,450
And then we'll be ready to take
and add it to the pork.

324
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:54,119
                There you go.

325
00:11:00,027 --> 00:11:01,059
So, now we have the masa.

326
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:02,127
                    Yes.

327
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:03,728
             Gonna put the salt.

328
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,130
 Little baking soda.
                          Yes.

329
00:11:05,132 --> 00:11:06,531
To puff it a little bit.

330
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:09,134
       Add some more shortening.

331
00:11:09,136 --> 00:11:12,604
 Now we're gonna put
the pork stock into the masa.

332
00:11:12,606 --> 00:11:15,273
         Then we're gonna start
      mixing it up all together.

333
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:17,676
 So, I got the pork.

334
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:18,677
        Mmm!

335
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:20,445
      Oh, yeah.

336
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,713
      Sabroso.

337
00:11:22,883 --> 00:11:24,582
       Skins.
                  The masa.

338
00:11:24,584 --> 00:11:25,784
        Okay.

339
00:11:25,786 --> 00:11:27,652
You soften them in the water
 so they're pliable.

340
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:28,753
                There you go.

341
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:31,523
        Okay.

342
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:32,724
        Over?
                   Just roll it.

343
00:11:32,726 --> 00:11:33,892
                There you go.

344
00:11:33,894 --> 00:11:36,194
                  You know
            how to make tamales.

345
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:37,896
I've made a few tamales
     in my day.

346
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:40,498
This is a tamale pot.

347
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,867
See how that sits above
the water as they cook?

348
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,139
  All right, chef.
      We ready?

349
00:11:49,843 --> 00:11:51,376
        Whoa!

350
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:54,279
                Look at that.

351
00:11:58,285 --> 00:12:00,919
 They're delicious.
The masa has great texture.

352
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:02,187
The pork is delicious.

353
00:12:02,189 --> 00:12:03,588
   Not too spicy.

354
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,123
And you got a good ratio.

355
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,726
It's not a bunch of masa
and a little bit of pork inside.

356
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:09,794
 This is like a nice
       50/50.

357
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:12,597
 Just the right amount of sauce.

358
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:13,698
             WOMAN:
      Hot but not too hot.

359
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,433
 It leaves a nice little bite
        in your mouth.

360
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:16,735
   WOMAN: Everything you order
        is gonna be good,

361
00:12:16,737 --> 00:12:19,170
       so it's really fun
    to try different things.

362
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:20,672
         Chamorro plate.
            It's hot.

363
00:12:20,674 --> 00:12:23,241
This is the Chamorro plate.
  It's super yummy.

364
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,043
     It has meat
 with the red sauce.

365
00:12:25,045 --> 00:12:27,278
          It's magical.

366
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,713
                  Chamorro.
       Yeah.

367
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:30,515
              What does it mean
                 in English?
 The shank.

368
00:12:30,517 --> 00:12:31,816
              That's the shank?
   Uh-huh.

369
00:12:31,818 --> 00:12:34,119
                 Big shank.
       Go ahead. Get me started.

370
00:12:34,121 --> 00:12:36,154
                    Okay.
      We're gonna salt it first.

371
00:12:36,156 --> 00:12:37,355
                     So,
            I have to sear them.

372
00:12:37,357 --> 00:12:39,691
FIERI: Oh, we're gonna
sear them off on the flattop.

373
00:12:39,693 --> 00:12:41,092
                    Yeah.

374
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,293
While those are searing?

375
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:44,095
      We're gonna make the salsa
              for the Chamorro.

376
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,864
     We have all the ingredients
                 over here.

377
00:12:45,866 --> 00:12:48,066
               We have cloves,
                 bay leaves.

378
00:12:48,068 --> 00:12:49,667
   Some coriander.

379
00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:52,270
  Mexican oregano.
             Mexican oregano.

380
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:53,872
                         Cumin.
Cumin seeds. Got it.

381
00:12:53,874 --> 00:12:55,473
                  Allspice.

382
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:57,142
                 Peppercorn.
  Garlic.

383
00:12:57,144 --> 00:12:58,176
                   Onions.
    Onions.

384
00:12:58,178 --> 00:12:59,677
              And then ginger.

385
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:02,447
  Ginger? Come on.
     In Mexico?

386
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:03,748
              That one is mine.
[ Laughs ]

387
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:04,883
     I have to find something --

388
00:13:04,885 --> 00:13:06,417
I'm gonna tell your mom.

389
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:08,086
He changed the recipe.
                [ Chuckles ]

390
00:13:08,088 --> 00:13:10,088
         So then we're gonna put
               some of the --

391
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:12,123
     Super spicy
with the chili de arbol.

392
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:15,093
We got kind of spicy and smokey
 with the guajillo,

393
00:13:15,095 --> 00:13:16,861
   and pretty mild
with the California.

394
00:13:16,863 --> 00:13:18,363
                 Some water.

395
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:19,497
        Okay.

396
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:20,799
                Put the lid.

397
00:13:25,872 --> 00:13:27,505
Gonna drop them in the pot
with a little bit of water,

398
00:13:27,507 --> 00:13:30,341
and this is when we're
gonna cook them low and slow.

399
00:13:30,343 --> 00:13:31,743
  Hang on a second.
I want to taste that.

400
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,613
    Oh, it's good
 except the ginger.

401
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:38,516
    I'm kidding.
     [ Laughs ]

402
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:40,552
Now we're gonna cook all
the mixture off a little bit.

403
00:13:40,554 --> 00:13:41,619
                   Right.

404
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:44,622
   Once it's done,
we put the sauce on there,

405
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:45,924
and then this all goes
for an hour and a half.

406
00:13:45,926 --> 00:13:47,592
             All together. Yeah.

407
00:13:47,594 --> 00:13:48,827
               We're gonna put
                some peppers.

408
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:49,994
Which peppers are these?

409
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,797
         California and guajillo
               and the arbol.

410
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:54,833
          So now we're gonna put
                  the salt.

411
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:56,167
We're gonna cover it?

412
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:58,403
                    Yeah,
          we're gonna cover now.

413
00:13:58,405 --> 00:13:59,938
      This is the peruano beans.

414
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,739
       Herano?
                    Peruano.

415
00:14:03,143 --> 00:14:06,077
            We have the Chamorro
                 ready here.

416
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:16,521
  We just put some pico de gallo
               in the middle.

417
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:18,389
                Queso fresco.

418
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:24,662
It's delicious, Chef.

419
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:26,898
It's got great texture,
   not too spicy.

420
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,968
This has a lot of depth.

421
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:31,269
 Not over seasoned.

422
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:32,670
The meat's super tender.

423
00:14:32,672 --> 00:14:33,972
Today is my lucky day.

424
00:14:33,974 --> 00:14:36,708
I followed the rainbow.
You're my pot of gold.

425
00:14:38,845 --> 00:14:40,712
           Chamorro ready to go.

426
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:42,447
    It is absolutely amazing.

427
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:45,483
              MAN:
       It's really tay.t  errin.

428
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:47,218
 It's just good food, honestly.

429
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:51,022
    Everybody comes in happy,
 leaves stuffed and more happy.

430
00:14:51,024 --> 00:14:54,626
   The food and the service and
the family energy is outrageous.

431
00:14:54,628 --> 00:14:56,861
It's been an awesome experience.
             Very proud of you.

432
00:14:58,865 --> 00:14:59,864
             FIERI:
     Up next in Monterey...

433
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:00,865
         How about I assist you,
                   doctor?

434
00:15:00,867 --> 00:15:01,866
     You got it.

435
00:15:01,868 --> 00:15:03,668
        ...I'm working it
        at a fish house...

436
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,969
          We're oyster tag team.

437
00:15:04,971 --> 00:15:07,572
      ...that's reeling in
        the mother lode.
                       Wow!

438
00:15:16,816 --> 00:15:19,617
So, I'm here on Del Monte Avenue
    in Monterey, California.

439
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:21,052
    Now, back in the heyday,

440
00:15:21,054 --> 00:15:23,354
         this right here
   was the major thoroughfare,

441
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:24,756
     and the joint I'm here
          to check out,

442
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:27,525
    it was the company store
  for the Del Monte train line.

443
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:29,961
     Now it's the go-to spot
           for locals

444
00:15:29,963 --> 00:15:31,596
   when they want fresh fish.

445
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:33,264
  This is Monterey Fish House.

446
00:15:37,704 --> 00:15:39,203
           I come here
    essentially every night.

447
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,308
        Medium rare tuna.
   Pick it up. Let's go, guys.

448
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:45,877
Monterey Bay has a very generous
          ocean for us,

449
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:47,879
    so it's always giving us
 an abundance of fresh seafood.

450
00:15:47,881 --> 00:15:49,447
    We're off the hook here.

451
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:51,349
             FIERI:
      Yeah, hook to table.

452
00:15:51,351 --> 00:15:53,551
     Chef David Digirolamo's
         family recipes

453
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:59,157
   have been reeling in locals
           since '94.

454
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:01,159
           Oysters up.
     MAN: Barbecued oysters.

455
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:03,594
   Super smokey flavor to them
 makes it unique and different.

456
00:16:03,596 --> 00:16:05,763
      FIERI: That's because
  they're grilled over oak wood

457
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:08,700
       that David harvests
     from his own backyard.

458
00:16:10,036 --> 00:16:11,769
         What are we gonna make?
 The grilled oysters.

459
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:15,006
These are Pacific oysters

460
00:16:15,008 --> 00:16:16,808
 from the Hood Canal
   in Washington.

461
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,609
          Do you shuck to order
          or do you shuck ahead?

462
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:19,978
 We shuck to order.

463
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,179
           Shuck the front door.

464
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:22,981
    [ Chuckles ]

465
00:16:25,085 --> 00:16:27,585
    And then just
a little clarified butter

466
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:28,753
  and fresh garlic.

467
00:16:28,755 --> 00:16:31,856
    Real simple.
That's all we put on them.

468
00:16:31,858 --> 00:16:32,991
                Now it's time
             to go to the grill?

469
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:34,325
    That's right.

470
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:36,661
Two or three minutes,
they'll start to boil,

471
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:37,729
and another two or three
minutes, they're done.

472
00:16:37,731 --> 00:16:39,397
                   Got it.

473
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:41,032
                 All right,
             so cocktail sauce.

474
00:16:41,034 --> 00:16:42,667
          It's a little ketchup.
   Little ketchup.

475
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:45,603
    Horseradish.
    Lemon juice.

476
00:16:45,605 --> 00:16:47,872
     So, we are like in the race
                  right now

477
00:16:47,874 --> 00:16:49,907
             because the oysters
              are almost done,

478
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:51,976
               so can he make
             the cocktail sauce?

479
00:16:53,947 --> 00:16:55,246
              How about I dump
                 the garlic?
Go ahead.

480
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:57,682
        How much Worcestershire?

481
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:59,283
    It's probably
 just a few ounces,

482
00:16:59,285 --> 00:17:00,785
  but I've done it
  so many times --

483
00:17:00,787 --> 00:17:02,387
       I like how you just do it
                so technical.
I can tell, yeah.

484
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:03,855
        Tell me when I hot sauce
                 this thing.

485
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:05,223
Go ahead, 'cause we like it
   a little spicy.

486
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:06,624
  Add a little salt
     and pepper.

487
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:08,159
                  We good.
That's good.

488
00:17:08,161 --> 00:17:10,261
             I'll continue that.
             You want to grab
             the oysters, here?

489
00:17:10,263 --> 00:17:11,863
I'll grab the oysters.

490
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:13,765
          We're oyster tag team.

491
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:19,604
                    Wow!

492
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,512
                    Mmm.

493
00:17:27,514 --> 00:17:28,880
     That's good cocktail sauce.

494
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:30,248
        Yeah.
Got a little kick to it.

495
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,783
                    Phew!

496
00:17:31,785 --> 00:17:34,952
These have got just such a nice,
 salty brininess to themselves,

497
00:17:34,954 --> 00:17:36,521
              then a little bit
               of the garlic,

498
00:17:36,523 --> 00:17:38,556
  and that garlic's just kind of
              lightly poached,

499
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,058
             and the smokiness.

500
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,359
        Yeah,
it really comes through.

501
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:44,962
               Delicious, man.
                Outstanding.

502
00:17:44,964 --> 00:17:48,032
 WOMAN: I tried the oak-grilled
oysters here for the first time.

503
00:17:48,034 --> 00:17:50,168
It was the most incredible thing
           I ever had.

504
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:53,504
   WOMAN: That oak flavor gets
    engulfed into the oyster.

505
00:17:53,506 --> 00:17:54,572
           Oh, my God.

506
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:56,808
             WOMAN:
 This place gets the fresh fish

507
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:59,343
  because they fish a lot of it
         for themselves.

508
00:17:59,345 --> 00:18:01,679
My family goes back generations
    as fishermen.

509
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:02,780
                   Really?

510
00:18:02,782 --> 00:18:04,215
Yeah, I fish commercial salmon
     every year.

511
00:18:04,217 --> 00:18:05,249
                     No.
     Yeah.

512
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,085
       MAN: Most of the fish
        you see right here

513
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:09,320
       was probably caught
   within the last day or so.

514
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:11,556
   It's as fresh as they come.

515
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:13,391
  Sicilian holiday pasta, guys.

516
00:18:13,393 --> 00:18:16,360
  The Sicilian holiday pasta's
            the best.

517
00:18:16,362 --> 00:18:19,630
    It's got mussels, clams,
    scallops, baby octopus,

518
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:22,633
     calamari, and anything
 that's fresh out of the ocean.

519
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:24,902
                 All right,
        what are we making next?

520
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:26,337
  We're gonna make
    the marinara.

521
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:27,972
That's one of the ingredients
in the Sicilian holiday pasta.

522
00:18:27,974 --> 00:18:29,207
                    Okay.

523
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:32,143
I'm gonna put some olive oil
in the bottom of the pan.

524
00:18:32,145 --> 00:18:33,744
    White onion.
   Little garlic.

525
00:18:33,746 --> 00:18:34,812
               Little garlic?

526
00:18:34,814 --> 00:18:36,881
               That's my level
             of a little garlic.

527
00:18:36,883 --> 00:18:39,584
        Kind of a chunky tomato.

528
00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:40,718
      Bay leaf.

529
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,553
                    How about
        I assist you, doctor?
You got it.

530
00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:44,555
A little granulated garlic.

531
00:18:44,557 --> 00:18:46,924
              Oregano, doctor?
Yes, sir.

532
00:18:46,926 --> 00:18:50,161
                   Basil.
  Little bit of salt and pepper.

533
00:18:50,163 --> 00:18:52,196
    Doctor, I feel the surgery's
          coming on quite nice.

534
00:18:52,198 --> 00:18:53,764
                There you go.

535
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:56,300
    So, everybody's in the pool.
      How long's this gonna go?

536
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:58,636
Maybe 15, 20 minutes.

537
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:00,304
So, the marinara's done.
   Now we make...?

538
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:02,273
                Put together
     the Sicilian holiday pasta.

539
00:19:02,275 --> 00:19:03,941
          Ladle of the marinara.

540
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:05,676
                 Clam juice.

541
00:19:05,678 --> 00:19:07,278
             You make your own?
   We do.

542
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,546
Green-lipped mussel.

543
00:19:08,548 --> 00:19:10,114
       Clams.

544
00:19:10,116 --> 00:19:12,316
 Swordfish, salmon,
    and raw cod.

545
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:17,121
            What a bounty, dude.

546
00:19:17,123 --> 00:19:19,857
          Baby octopus, scallop,
              and some shrimp?

547
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:20,858
        Yes.

548
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,960
                   Butter.
      Butter.

549
00:19:22,962 --> 00:19:24,962
And a little bit of pesto.

550
00:19:24,964 --> 00:19:26,631
               Now, how long's
               that gonna go?

551
00:19:26,633 --> 00:19:27,632
Just to where they open.

552
00:19:27,634 --> 00:19:28,633
                And the fish
               is just opaque?

553
00:19:28,635 --> 00:19:29,901
     Yes.
                And boom, we go.

554
00:19:29,903 --> 00:19:30,935
The fresh-made linguini.

555
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:34,138
     What a beautiful dish, man.

556
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:38,209
                Look at that!
                    Unh!

557
00:19:38,211 --> 00:19:39,443
 And I would garnish

558
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:41,913
with just a little bit
of that fresh pesto right there.

559
00:19:44,117 --> 00:19:45,850
             Everything's fresh.

560
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:49,787
                    Mmm!

561
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:50,988
                 Nice broth.

562
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,190
  Doesn't overpower the seafood.

563
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:55,159
             Like how you nested
                 everything.

564
00:19:55,161 --> 00:19:57,128
          The calamari is cooked
               just perfectly.

565
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:01,098
                  Awesome.

566
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,133
   Hey, thank you.
                       Good job.

567
00:20:04,604 --> 00:20:06,837
       It's very creative.
 You can't get it anywhere else.

568
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:08,706
             Here is my brother
            from another mother.

569
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,341
             This is G. Garvin.

570
00:20:10,343 --> 00:20:12,109
                 Now, G. has
      "Road Trip with G. Garvin"

571
00:20:12,111 --> 00:20:13,544
         on the Cooking Channel.

572
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:16,013
 He's also one of my best judges
      on "Guy's Grocery Games."

573
00:20:16,015 --> 00:20:18,549
          Tell me what you think
                  of this.

574
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:21,018
    Super delish.

575
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,787
 It's unbelievable.
    It's bananas.

576
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:24,889
              MAN:
  It's the freshest fish around

577
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:26,457
      and best place to eat
          in this town.

578
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:28,125
                When you come
                to Monterey,

579
00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:29,493
       this is the kind of joint
              you want to visit

580
00:20:29,495 --> 00:20:31,696
              if you're looking
    for real-deal fresh seafood.

581
00:20:31,698 --> 00:20:33,064
               Nice job, man.
   Thanks.

582
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:37,868
          So, that's it
 for this Flavortown road trip,

583
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:39,136
      but don't you worry.

584
00:20:39,138 --> 00:20:41,539
   There's plenty more joints
     all over this country!

585
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:43,040
     I'll be looking for you
            next time

586
00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:45,710
     on "Diners, Drive-ins,
           and Dives."

587
00:20:45,712 --> 00:20:46,978
I don't know if you've ever seen
   the show we do.

588
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,646
It's called --
                  What show?
                 Who are you?

589
00:20:48,648 --> 00:20:50,014
    Yeah.

590
00:20:50,016 --> 00:20:51,449
          [ Laughter ]

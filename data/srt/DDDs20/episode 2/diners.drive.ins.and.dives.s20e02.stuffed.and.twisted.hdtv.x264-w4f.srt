1
00:00:01,235 --> 00:00:02,301
         Hey, everybody.

2
00:00:02,303 --> 00:00:03,769
         I'm Guy Fieri,
      and we're rolling out

3
00:00:03,771 --> 00:00:06,972
 looking for America's greatest
 diners, drive-ins, and dives.

4
00:00:06,974 --> 00:00:08,640
          This trip...
                     Oh, boy.

5
00:00:08,642 --> 00:00:10,242
   ...we're getting stuffed...

6
00:00:10,244 --> 00:00:12,378
    Oh, yeah.
        ...and twisted...

7
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,213
                 [ Laughs ]

8
00:00:14,215 --> 00:00:15,381
     ...in Jackson, Wyoming.

9
00:00:15,383 --> 00:00:16,815
                 Sports bar
         with French onion soup.

10
00:00:16,817 --> 00:00:18,450
            That's not something
             you see every day.

11
00:00:18,452 --> 00:00:21,754
     An all-American saloon
    with Semper Fi spirit...

12
00:00:21,756 --> 00:00:23,088
             Don't ever call me
                   a chef.

13
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:26,325
       ...going way behind
       rank-and-file food.

14
00:00:26,327 --> 00:00:27,459
                Gosh, I like
              the way you roll.

15
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:28,961
              Then,
   in Monterey, California...

16
00:00:28,963 --> 00:00:31,130
I'm getting a little
freaked out right now,

17
00:00:31,132 --> 00:00:32,965
     but I'll go
 with what you got.

18
00:00:32,967 --> 00:00:34,133
...a family-run Italian joint...

19
00:00:34,135 --> 00:00:35,300
      Nice job.
  Mom did it right.

20
00:00:35,302 --> 00:00:38,570
          ...where Mama
     definitely knows best.

21
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:41,640
We have a rule -- can't
wear more bling than
the host of the show.

22
00:00:41,642 --> 00:00:44,276
         And in Boston,
        Massachusetts...

23
00:00:44,278 --> 00:00:45,477
    Look at that.

24
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:46,979
           ...a funky
     little sandwich shop...

25
00:00:46,981 --> 00:00:48,147
  It's outrageous.

26
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:51,417
          ...putting on
   a full-court panini press.

27
00:00:51,419 --> 00:00:53,585
     Eating it?
I'm gonna devour it!

28
00:00:53,587 --> 00:00:55,621
     That's all right here,
           right now,

29
00:00:55,623 --> 00:00:58,323
     on "Diners, Drive-ins,
           and Dives."

32
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,339
  I'm here in Jackson, Wyoming,

33
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:16,975
          about a mile
 from the downtown tourist area,

34
00:01:16,977 --> 00:01:18,243
 and you know me on "Triple D."

35
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:20,045
       I don't want to go
     where the tourists go.

36
00:01:20,047 --> 00:01:22,114
          I want to go
      where the locals eat,

37
00:01:22,116 --> 00:01:24,349
      and I hear the joint
      you got to check out

38
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:26,485
         is Sidewinders
    American Grill & Tavern.

39
00:01:30,724 --> 00:01:31,890
       RICE: Carne asada.

40
00:01:31,892 --> 00:01:33,625
           Sidewinders
     is all about the food.

41
00:01:33,627 --> 00:01:35,194
       Barbecue burger up.

42
00:01:35,196 --> 00:01:38,230
 It's fresh, it's homemade, and
it's not trying to be too fancy.

43
00:01:38,232 --> 00:01:41,400
   FIERI: Just like its owner,
       ex-marine Joe Rice.

44
00:01:41,402 --> 00:01:43,068
              I'm not a chef.
              I'm a line cook.

45
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:45,304
            Just remember that.
      Don't ever call me a chef.

46
00:01:45,306 --> 00:01:48,974
       After flying jets,
Joe landed in the restaurant biz

47
00:01:48,976 --> 00:01:51,210
 and opened Sidewinders in '97,

48
00:01:51,212 --> 00:01:54,680
  naming it after the missiles
     on an F-4 fighter jet.

49
00:01:54,682 --> 00:01:56,081
            Really a sports bar,
               American grill

50
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:58,083
              with really good
              home-driven food.

51
00:01:58,085 --> 00:02:00,252
         The French onion soup's
                 to die for.

52
00:02:00,254 --> 00:02:01,920
    RICE: French onion soup!

53
00:02:01,922 --> 00:02:03,155
This is my favorite soup to have
        when I come here.

54
00:02:03,157 --> 00:02:05,424
    I appreciate
 French onion soup,

55
00:02:05,426 --> 00:02:07,626
and to find real-deal
  French onion soup

56
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:09,495
would be, like, epic.

57
00:02:09,497 --> 00:02:14,433
So, basically, we start
with some butter, olive oil.

58
00:02:14,435 --> 00:02:15,701
 Let that caramelize
    a little bit.

59
00:02:15,703 --> 00:02:20,706
We have Texas sweets,
regular whites, red onions,

60
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:22,541
       leeks.

61
00:02:22,543 --> 00:02:25,177
Then we'll sweat these down
  just translucent.

62
00:02:25,179 --> 00:02:26,645
   A little salt.

63
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:28,680
   Little garlic.

64
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:30,716
   Little pepper.
      Shallots.

65
00:02:30,718 --> 00:02:32,351
      Shallots have already been
                sweated down?

66
00:02:32,353 --> 00:02:35,187
 Yes. Little thyme.
 Stir that all in.

67
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:37,990
Add our sherry.
       That's really the kicker.

68
00:02:39,193 --> 00:02:41,093
              A little bay leaf
            and some beef stock?

69
00:02:41,095 --> 00:02:42,327
                You're making
            your own beef stock.

70
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:44,163
   Own beef stock.

71
00:02:44,165 --> 00:02:45,364
                  How long
     will we let this cook down?

72
00:02:45,366 --> 00:02:46,832
   About an hour.

73
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:51,603
  First thing we do
is we put a crostini in.
                           Okay.

74
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:55,174
Just do a little of our --
 the goodness, here.

75
00:02:55,176 --> 00:02:57,910
  Then a little --
      Oh, boy.

76
00:02:57,912 --> 00:02:59,211
                  Oh, boy.

77
00:02:59,213 --> 00:03:00,345
     [ Laughs ]

78
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,147
     You're gonna screw this up,
                 aren't you?

79
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:03,815
     [ Laughs ]
   A little Gree.

80
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:05,751
                 [ Laughs ]

81
00:03:05,753 --> 00:03:07,886
I pride myself on not knowing
the real way to say this.

82
00:03:07,888 --> 00:03:10,189
   You know what? I think that's
     good. I can't fly a plane.

83
00:03:10,191 --> 00:03:11,523
How do you say that?
                       Gruyère.

84
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:13,759
 Okay, thank you.
              Yeah. [ Laughs ]

85
00:03:13,761 --> 00:03:15,961
We're gonna take this
and put it in a Salamander.

86
00:03:15,963 --> 00:03:18,130
              To the Salamander
            to melt the Gruyère.

87
00:03:18,132 --> 00:03:19,364
     Right.
                         Okay.

88
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:21,066
                 All right.

89
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:23,735
                 Sports bar
         with French onion soup.

90
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:26,004
            That's not something
             you see every day.

91
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:30,042
               This is great,
        great French onion, man.

92
00:03:30,044 --> 00:03:31,310
     Thank you.

93
00:03:31,312 --> 00:03:33,579
  All the discipline is correct.
            The crock makes it.

94
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:36,048
     The way you cut the onions,
         the variety of onions,

95
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,849
          and the sherry level's
                  perfect.

96
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:38,884
         The salt level's right.

97
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:41,453
             The caramelization
               isn't too far.

98
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:44,323
         That's legit. Nice job.
Thank you.

99
00:03:44,325 --> 00:03:47,392
  The beef broth is to die for.

100
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:51,897
              MAN:
  It's a great balance between
  the crouton and the cheese.

101
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:53,632
        Wonderful taste.

102
00:03:54,602 --> 00:03:59,404
 I love the food because there's
   such a variety on the menu.

103
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,106
The Carne asada.
                         Really?
      Yeah.

104
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:03,041
   WOMAN: Sidewinder pretzel.

105
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:04,276
  I really love the "S" pretzel.
                It's so good.

106
00:04:04,278 --> 00:04:06,178
  When I was a kid,

107
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,080
I had a business selling
soft, New York-style pretzels.

108
00:04:08,082 --> 00:04:09,648
 Had a little cart.
  My foundation --

109
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:13,252
Now we give these carts away to
non-profit kids' organizations.

110
00:04:13,254 --> 00:04:15,087
It's an all-American treat.

111
00:04:15,089 --> 00:04:17,456
     It's our number-one seller.
I can understand why.

112
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:18,924
All right. Let's get into it,
then. Give me the rundown.

113
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:20,525
        We start with our yeast.

114
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:22,194
 We bloom the yeast.

115
00:04:22,196 --> 00:04:24,329
              Once it's set up,
        we start with olive oil.

116
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:27,266
               A little salt.
            Just a little honey.

117
00:04:27,268 --> 00:04:28,533
 All-purpose flour?

118
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:32,070
 Yeah, high-gluten, all-purpose.
            We'll pull this up.

119
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:35,140
              Slowly add water.

120
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:38,443
     Now we're gonna take it out
               and portion it.

121
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,178
          Get it on sheet trays,

122
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,948
      put it in the refrigerator
        for two hours to proof.

123
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:46,485
Then, when you're ready
to make a pretzel...

124
00:04:46,487 --> 00:04:48,754
             Just cut it in half
             and put that aside.

125
00:04:48,756 --> 00:04:50,989
            You just kind of go
    with your hand a little bit.

126
00:04:50,991 --> 00:04:52,391
And what can you get this
    stuffed with?

127
00:04:52,393 --> 00:04:56,228
         You can get it stuffed
     with mozzarella, pepperoni,

128
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,063
                jala-pee-nos.
   Jala-pee-nos?

129
00:04:58,065 --> 00:04:59,765
                Jala-pee-nos.
             How do you say it?

130
00:04:59,767 --> 00:05:02,868
I'm messing with a Marine,
giving him a hard time about
how he says "jalapeño."

131
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,504
         Put a little mozzarella
                  in there.

00:05:05,506 --> 00:05:07,973
            We basically take it
              and just roll it.

00:05:11,078 --> 00:05:12,978
 You can make these in any shape
       you want, but for you...

135
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,846
            I made one of those.

                  A little salt.
   All right.
Throw it in the oven?

139
00:05:20,354 --> 00:05:22,087
     What temp?
                        450.

140
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:25,290
How long's that gonna take
  to roll through?
             About five minutes.

141
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:27,959
  And here we go, coming out of
 the oven, ready to plate it up.

                    Yeah, we do.

this is how you do it.

  That's a pretzel.

00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,253
You hand-make it, and you
serve it with some attitude.

Mix all this together,

177
00:07:02,156 --> 00:07:04,523
and then we just take
this mixture, just rub it on.

          before you cook it?

Yeah, we let this set for like
two hours in the walk-in.

00:10:10,177 --> 00:10:12,210
      known for Cannery Row
      and awesome seafood.

261
00:10:12,212 --> 00:10:14,279
  Well, I'm in the locals area,
          I'm downtown,

262
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:16,514
      to check out a joint
     that the locals love --

263
00:10:16,516 --> 00:10:18,817
          an old-school
    family-run Italian joint.

264
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:20,685
        This is Rosine's.

265
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:25,023
        Angel hair pasta.

266
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:26,124
   We're down two or three times
                 every week.

267
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,325
                   This is
        our favorite restaurant.

268
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:29,227
        Chicken Parmesan.

269
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:30,395
  I don't like it.
     I love it.

270
00:10:30,397 --> 00:10:32,430
           It's better
   than my Sicilian grandma's.

271
00:10:32,432 --> 00:10:34,132
             Wow. Someone's out
                of the will.

272
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:37,068
 FIERI: Authentic Italian's been
      headlining this joint

273
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,204
           since 1980,
when Chef Jim Culcasi's parents,

274
00:10:39,206 --> 00:10:42,407
         Jim and Rosine,
    made it a family affair.

275
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:45,510
    Everything is absolutely
    amazing. I've never had
    a bad meal here.

276
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:47,545
            Lasagna.

277
00:10:47,547 --> 00:10:50,415
And the lasagna, with the layers
   of stuff, it's really nice.

278
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:52,017
     Okay, let's
get into making this.

279
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:54,519
 We are making our Jim's special
       filling for our lasagna.

280
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:56,688
 Your who?
              Jim's special --
              my father's name.

281
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,757
Did he make this, or your mom
made this for your dad?

282
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:00,492
             My mom for my dad.
That's beautiful.

283
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:03,361
All right, fire it up, man.
                 All right.
    We start off with olive oil.

284
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:05,163
               Then we drop in
              our ground chuck.

285
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,533
We're all browned up.
      Next up?

286
00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:12,404
             Onions. Mushrooms.
                  Oregano.

287
00:11:12,406 --> 00:11:13,638
 Granulated garlic.

288
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,973
                Sweet basil.

289
00:11:14,975 --> 00:11:17,942
               Touch of salt.
                 And pepper.

290
00:11:17,944 --> 00:11:19,711
              We let this cook.
     and then we add the nutmeg.

291
00:11:19,713 --> 00:11:21,646
           And then the spinach.

292
00:11:21,648 --> 00:11:24,482
All that is gonna work as
the layering inside the lasagna.
                           Yes.

293
00:11:24,484 --> 00:11:27,819
Next up?
            We're going to build
                the lasagna.

294
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:29,421
      Together.

295
00:11:29,423 --> 00:11:33,224
 We start off with our red sauce
               on the bottom.

296
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:38,329
                Pasta sheets.
       And then go with ricotta.

297
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:39,431
               Jim's special.

298
00:11:39,433 --> 00:11:42,400
          Next, Parmesan cheese.
Parm.

299
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:44,302
                Jack cheese.
    Jack?

300
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:47,622
                    Jack.
                 More sauce.

301
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:49,524
  How many layers?
                         Four.
    [ Whistlesg  out, let it co.

302
00:11:50,827 --> 00:11:52,961
                There we go.

303
00:11:52,963 --> 00:11:54,963
               Sauce the top.

304
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:57,432
          Little Parmesan cheese
                and parsley.

305
00:11:57,434 --> 00:11:58,867
                There we go.

306
00:12:03,206 --> 00:12:05,707
    This has got
  multiple layers.

307
00:12:05,709 --> 00:12:09,144
Super rich and thick.
Tender pasta. Creamy.

308
00:12:09,146 --> 00:12:11,446
  All the balance.

309
00:12:11,448 --> 00:12:14,582
That's the example of lasagna
like your mom used to make.

310
00:12:14,584 --> 00:12:17,819
Jimbo, nice job, man.
Nice job. Mom did it right.
                   She sure did.

311
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:20,688
  All right. Here you guys go.
      Here's your lasagna.

312
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:23,425
  It's like the perfect amount
       of meat and cheese.

313
00:12:23,427 --> 00:12:26,528
            How's that lasagna?
       It's as big as your head.

314
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:27,929
   It is enormous,
and it is incredibly tasty.

315
00:12:27,931 --> 00:12:30,465
    Ultimate burger, reuben.
           Table six!

316
00:12:30,467 --> 00:12:33,701
How long you worked here?
         All my life, basically.
                 Since 1980.

317
00:12:33,703 --> 00:12:35,603
Your mom's place?
              My mom's, Rosine.

318
00:12:35,605 --> 00:12:37,839
Is your mom Italian?
        Yes. Sicilian, actually.

319
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:39,741
             FIERI:
    And if you time it right,

320
00:12:39,743 --> 00:12:42,310
   you'll catch Rosine herself
   helping out in the kitchen.

321
00:12:42,312 --> 00:12:43,878
  This is definitely a family.

322
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,014
You couldn't get any more family
           than this.

323
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:48,616
    They're always walking
    around to make sure you
    got everything you want.

324
00:12:48,618 --> 00:12:51,953
    You're gonna get
    a wonderful home-cooked
    meal, wonderful portion.

325
00:12:51,955 --> 00:12:53,421
              MAN:
     Here's your minestrone.

326
00:12:53,423 --> 00:12:54,689
       Tell me
about the minestrone.

327
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:55,924
          Minestrone's
         off the charts.

328
00:12:55,926 --> 00:13:00,595
The minestrone soup is
one of the locals' favorites.

329
00:13:00,597 --> 00:13:02,430
              We're gonna make
            our minestrone soup.
Okay.

330
00:13:02,432 --> 00:13:05,366
        We start with top round.

331
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:07,168
   Do we get hot?

332
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:09,370
           No. We start it cold.
                   Watch.

333
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:11,906
I'm getting a little
freaked out right now, but
I'll with what you got.

334
00:13:11,908 --> 00:13:13,141
               Dry red beans.

335
00:13:13,143 --> 00:13:14,843
              Granulated garlic
                 and onion.
  Hold on.

336
00:13:14,845 --> 00:13:18,046
    How many cups
of granulated onion and garlic?
                     A lot.

337
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:20,181
                   Sugar.

338
00:13:20,183 --> 00:13:23,351
                  Oregano.
                Sweet basil.

339
00:13:23,353 --> 00:13:25,420
                Black pepper.
                 Bay leaves.

340
00:13:25,422 --> 00:13:27,689
                White pepper.
                Tomato paste.

341
00:13:27,691 --> 00:13:29,257
                 Beef base.

342
00:13:29,259 --> 00:13:30,425
             Then we add water.
 Okay.

343
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:35,663
             We give it a stir.
                 Here we go.

344
00:13:35,665 --> 00:13:38,700
      And then we add our diced
  tomatoes and our tomato sauce.

345
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:42,770
This is, without question,

346
00:13:42,772 --> 00:13:45,406
one of the craziest minestrones
   I've ever seen.

347
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:47,509
 No other veggies.
                        No, no.

348
00:13:47,511 --> 00:13:49,177
         This is the first part.
This is the beginning.

349
00:13:49,179 --> 00:13:51,646
          This is the beginning.
Okay, don't rush the song.

350
00:13:51,648 --> 00:13:54,115
       We're gonna let this cook
          for about four hours.
Four hours.

351
00:13:54,117 --> 00:13:55,917
     Now we're ready to pull out
                all the beef.

352
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:58,186
        Okay.

353
00:13:58,188 --> 00:13:59,821
                 All right.
         Just put it on the pan.

354
00:13:59,823 --> 00:14:00,855
             All the beef's out.

355
00:14:00,857 --> 00:14:02,690
You let this cool down
before you shred it.

356
00:14:02,692 --> 00:14:03,791
                  Exactly.

357
00:14:03,793 --> 00:14:05,860
             Next step will be,
               we add celery.

358
00:14:05,862 --> 00:14:08,830
                  Carrots.

359
00:14:08,832 --> 00:14:10,198
                  Zucchini.

360
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,400
                   Onions.
                And cabbage.

361
00:14:12,402 --> 00:14:15,537
I like where this is
going. How much longer
you gonna let this cook?

362
00:14:15,539 --> 00:14:17,338
 Till the vegetables are tender.
               About an hour.

363
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,507
                There we go.

364
00:14:19,509 --> 00:14:22,944
You take all this meat now,
   shred it...
                  Shred it, yes.

365
00:14:22,946 --> 00:14:24,879
...and throw it back in.

366
00:14:24,881 --> 00:14:25,980
  All right, Jimmy,
     dish it up.

367
00:14:25,982 --> 00:14:28,182
             A little pasta in.
  Okay.

368
00:14:28,184 --> 00:14:30,718
So, I like the pasta's not
floating in the pot thing,

369
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,220
     'cause that
always drives me nuts.

370
00:14:34,824 --> 00:14:37,692
          And then we top it off
          with Parmesan cheese.

371
00:14:37,694 --> 00:14:39,527
              Start your meal.

372
00:14:46,903 --> 00:14:48,503
 I love the cabbage
      in there.

373
00:14:48,505 --> 00:14:49,704
 The shredded beef,

374
00:14:49,706 --> 00:14:53,374
  not something you
typically find in minestrone.

375
00:14:53,376 --> 00:14:55,877
 A nice, rich broth.
I mean, the whole thing.
                         Great.

376
00:14:55,879 --> 00:14:58,046
It's delicious. But I
want to call the real boss in.

377
00:14:58,048 --> 00:14:59,814
       Rosine,
 are you back there?

378
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:02,317
      Now, this
  is the authority.

379
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:03,818
    You got a lot
to be proud of, girl.

380
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,254
Very nice to meet you.
    Well, thank you, Guy.
    Very nice to meet you.

381
00:15:06,256 --> 00:15:07,822
Look at her. To the nines --
the hair, the bling.

382
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:09,157
   We have a rule

383
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:12,060
that you can't wear more bling
than the host of the show.

384
00:15:12,062 --> 00:15:13,828
   Oh, my gosh!
                      [ Laughs ]

385
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:14,929
        JIM: Minestrone!

386
00:15:14,931 --> 00:15:16,364
         MAN: Can't wait
    to get it in your mouth.

387
00:15:16,366 --> 00:15:19,067
    As soon as you taste it,
    you know that it's
    absolutely homemade.

388
00:15:19,069 --> 00:15:20,635
             MAN #2:
    Here's your lamb shanks.

389
00:15:20,637 --> 00:15:22,770
 Young Man: It feels like home.
   You get good, cooked food.

390
00:15:22,772 --> 00:15:24,305
 It's real hearty, fills you up.

391
00:15:24,307 --> 00:15:25,673
  Come down Friday.

392
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:28,943
That's when she's here
  making the cakes.

393
00:15:28,945 --> 00:15:30,745
        Oh, I'll make you
     a pie you won't forget.

394
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:35,216
         FIERI: Up next,
   in Boston, Massachusetts...

395
00:15:35,218 --> 00:15:37,285
 It's gonna be okay.
We're jumping together.

396
00:15:37,287 --> 00:15:40,521
     ...a neighborhood joint
       stuffing supper...
The bird is the word.

397
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:42,890
       ...into sandwiches.
Rock-star sandwich.
   Delicious.

398
00:15:49,733 --> 00:15:51,499
     So, I'm here at Boston

399
00:15:51,501 --> 00:15:54,836
    in front of a "Triple D"
 original -- Mike's City Diner.

400
00:15:54,838 --> 00:15:56,838
               All right, Jay,
         what do you got for me?
You're in the wrong place.

401
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,040
 Around the corner,
across the hospital.

402
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:01,075
Great gourmet sandwiches.
      The bomb.

403
00:16:01,077 --> 00:16:02,710
                You the man.
                   Thanks.

404
00:16:04,347 --> 00:16:06,047
           This is it.
         This is Blunch.

405
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:12,487
      One beef ready to go.

406
00:16:12,489 --> 00:16:13,955
      Serving up sandwiches

407
00:16:13,957 --> 00:16:17,158
     has been job number one
     for Chef Nikki Christo

408
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,328
       since she opened up
 this funky little space in '07.

409
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:22,263
How many square feet
  you have here, 6?

410
00:16:22,265 --> 00:16:24,098
                Uh, no, 400.
    400.

411
00:16:25,602 --> 00:16:27,135
              Here's the loaf.

412
00:16:27,137 --> 00:16:29,437
WOMAN: I've pretty much had
everything on the menu,

413
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,471
 and I've never had
 a bad thing here.

414
00:16:30,473 --> 00:16:31,939
          Her concept?

415
00:16:31,941 --> 00:16:34,575
 Serving a great, savory dinner
  between two slices of bread.

416
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:37,545
    My favorite is meat loaf.

417
00:16:37,547 --> 00:16:39,447
  She makes her own roast beef.

418
00:16:39,449 --> 00:16:41,449
  The bird is probably my go-to
   sandwich when I come here.

419
00:16:41,451 --> 00:16:44,619
The first one we're making
    is the bird.
                            Yep.

420
00:16:44,621 --> 00:16:46,521
We're gonna start with boneless,
        skinless chicken breast

421
00:16:46,523 --> 00:16:47,522
        with a little olive oil.

422
00:16:47,524 --> 00:16:48,856
                Dried basil.

423
00:16:48,858 --> 00:16:50,792
 Granulated garlic?
                 That's correct.

424
00:16:50,794 --> 00:16:53,628
                Black pepper.
   A blend of Italian seasoning.

425
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:56,931
              Granulated onion.
             Little kosher salt.

426
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:59,534
     A little bit of lemon juice
                  in here.

427
00:16:59,536 --> 00:17:01,502
       Finish it off with water.

428
00:17:01,504 --> 00:17:03,504
Poaching the chicken.
                        Correct.

429
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:07,675
             In the oven we go.
What temp?

430
00:17:07,677 --> 00:17:11,312
                 375 degrees
   for about 45 to 50 minutes --

431
00:17:11,314 --> 00:17:14,215
           until it reaches 165.

432
00:17:14,217 --> 00:17:18,086
             We chill overnight
       so we get a better slice.

433
00:17:21,591 --> 00:17:23,624
         Give it a little slice.
    There we go.
    Little slice.

434
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:26,127
         All right, so, now
         we're gonna add some
         of the artichoke aioli.

435
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:28,062
                  Next are
      the oven-roasted tomatoes.

436
00:17:28,064 --> 00:17:30,531
                  A little
             mozzarella cheese.

437
00:17:30,533 --> 00:17:32,867
  We're gonna throw some of that
         nice chicken in there.

438
00:17:32,869 --> 00:17:33,901
        Okay.

439
00:17:33,903 --> 00:17:35,503
                And now we're
             gonna press her up.

440
00:17:38,775 --> 00:17:41,576
      Now we're gonna finish it
     with some nice baby greens.

441
00:17:44,781 --> 00:17:46,481
            And that's the bird.

442
00:17:48,017 --> 00:17:51,285
Don't hold your breath.
 It's gonna be okay.

443
00:17:51,287 --> 00:17:53,654
We're jumping together.
                           Okay.

444
00:17:58,128 --> 00:18:00,428
 Mmm.
         Glad, you're eating it.

445
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:03,197
    "Eating it"?!
Geez, I'm gonna devour it.

446
00:18:03,199 --> 00:18:05,266
  A great sandwich.

447
00:18:05,268 --> 00:18:07,902
It's the roast chicken dinner
on really good bread.

448
00:18:07,904 --> 00:18:09,137
It's all house-made.

449
00:18:09,139 --> 00:18:10,338
     That rocks.

450
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,640
                     Awesome.
The bird is the word.

451
00:18:12,642 --> 00:18:14,041
 Awesome job, Nikki.

452
00:18:14,043 --> 00:18:16,844
               I got two birds
                ready to fly.

453
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:18,446
      MAN: Let me tell you
  a little bit about the bird.

454
00:18:18,448 --> 00:18:19,814
        The meat is like
    a little slice of heaven.

455
00:18:19,816 --> 00:18:21,682
    The vegetables are fresh.

456
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:23,785
  I love the roasted tomatoes.

457
00:18:23,787 --> 00:18:24,952
     It's pretty taste-ado.

458
00:18:24,954 --> 00:18:27,388
 Nikki knows everybody by name.

459
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:29,957
       One meltdown for Claudia.
              For you, Vincent.

460
00:18:29,959 --> 00:18:32,393
     I thought I was special
  'cause she'd say, "Hi, Bob,"

461
00:18:32,395 --> 00:18:34,362
      and then I realized,
    no, she knows everybody.

462
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:37,298
     The Provencal for you, Bob.
   When someone says "Blunch,"

463
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,101
   the first thing that comes
to mind is a Provencal sandwich.

464
00:18:40,103 --> 00:18:42,804
     The Provencal is one
     of the many vegetarian
     sandwiches on the menu

465
00:18:42,806 --> 00:18:44,438
    which I am a sucker for.

466
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:49,010
              We're gonna make
               the Provencal.
Let's make it happen.

467
00:18:49,012 --> 00:18:50,478
               We're gonna add
               the goat cheese

468
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,680
         that we whip here with
    a little bit of light cream.

469
00:18:52,682 --> 00:18:55,783
           Then we're gonna take
           a fresh-basil pesto.

470
00:18:55,785 --> 00:18:58,186
                We also puree
         our own kalamata olives

471
00:18:58,188 --> 00:19:00,388
                  with some
         extra virgin olive oil.

472
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:03,057
               Fresh tomatoes.

473
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:05,092
     Quartered artichoke hearts.

474
00:19:05,094 --> 00:19:07,662
      The oven-roasted tomatoes.

475
00:19:07,664 --> 00:19:09,997
            Pop it on the press.

476
00:19:09,999 --> 00:19:13,134
             We're gonna finish
             with baby greens.

477
00:19:13,136 --> 00:19:14,769
    Personally --
 I like the name --

478
00:19:14,771 --> 00:19:16,537
I would have called this
  "Hippie Picnic."

479
00:19:16,539 --> 00:19:18,072
              A Hippie Picnic.

480
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:21,542
It's the best name for
a sandwich in the world.

481
00:19:21,544 --> 00:19:23,744
    Look at that.

482
00:19:29,185 --> 00:19:31,752
        Mmm.
      Oh, yeah.

483
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:35,289
That richness of the goat cheese
really carries a long way.

484
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:36,791
  But then you have
the roasted tomatoes,

485
00:19:36,793 --> 00:19:39,360
and you have the artichoke
hearts, which have
great texture to them.

486
00:19:39,362 --> 00:19:41,128
 The fresh tomatoes,
the brightness from that.

487
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:44,198
And then the key to it is having
that super-hot panini --

488
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,200
really delivers the crunch
   on the outside

489
00:19:46,202 --> 00:19:49,036
and the fresh greens
   going into it.

490
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:51,472
It's outrageous. I mean, it's
really a delicious sandwich.

491
00:19:51,474 --> 00:19:53,007
        Mmm.

492
00:19:53,009 --> 00:19:54,609
               Two Provencals
                 coming up.

493
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:58,546
    Every bite is just
    like a kaleidoscope that
    opens up in your mouth.

494
00:19:58,548 --> 00:20:00,982
                   FIERI:
         So, I see what happens.

495
00:20:00,984 --> 00:20:06,087
        You have one of the most
        successful "Triple D"
        joints ever in Boston,

496
00:20:06,089 --> 00:20:07,355
              This is our boy,
                  Jay Hajj.

497
00:20:07,357 --> 00:20:09,223
     You're the one that sent me
           down here to Blunch.

498
00:20:09,225 --> 00:20:11,659
I got to tell you,
she's so creative.
The food is awesome.

499
00:20:11,661 --> 00:20:13,961
 MAN: Nikki makes it with love,
and it's just a whole experience

500
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:16,597
       when you come here
   to have a Blunch sandwich.

501
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:20,434
I look at "Provencal."
That doesn't say "Buy me."

502
00:20:20,436 --> 00:20:24,572
I look at "Hippie Picnic."
Says, "I'm in it to win it."

503
00:20:24,574 --> 00:20:25,907
             CHRISTO: "Buy me."
Yeah.

504
00:20:25,909 --> 00:20:27,842
 Rock-star sandwich.
    Delicious.
        It's good. Thank you.

505
00:20:30,046 --> 00:20:33,047

  the meat taking center stage.

The pickle fries are at
another level of ridiculous.

135

    JOHNSON: We had a fry slicer
          we weren't using.

136
00:04:23,998 --> 00:04:24,930
                 One night,
             we started getting

137
00:04:25,032 --> 00:04:26,298
               a little crazy
             and a little kooky,

138
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,733
         and we started throwing
           pickles through them.

139
00:04:27,835 --> 00:04:29,234
Just cornmeal and...

140
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:32,971
  It's like cornmeal with sugar,
      salt, and Cajun seasoning.

141
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:34,840
Top three best pickle
fries I've ever had.

       aren't bad, either.

  Smoked Wings -- black magic.

         They're crispy.
   They're juicy. They're hot.

When you can actually
      just feel

146

  the chicken fall
 right off the bone.

    -Our brine for our wings.

148
00:04:45,886 --> 00:04:47,119
               We're gonna do
               some hot sauce.

149
00:04:47,221 --> 00:04:52,024
Kosher salt, white sugar, plain,
         old Michigan tap water.

     these right into the brine.

that we hit the brisket with.

153

          -Absolutely.
  -In the smoker for how long?

154
00:05:01,035 --> 00:05:03,902
            For about an hour
        and a half to two hours.

155
00:05:04,004 --> 00:05:05,604
    When the come out,
we fry them before service?

156
00:05:05,706 --> 00:05:07,105
                    Yeah.

  You have all these
different wing sauces.

158

 We have your traditional Kansas
      City style barbecue sauce,

   -Michigan cherry preserves.

166
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:25,257
           A little bit of apple
              cider vinegar.

167

              Simmer for about
               a half an hour.

168

     And then we're gonna run it
 in just a regular, old blender.

that roasted chicken

267
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:06,945
     Again, first time I've ever
  seen star anise in a taqueria.

268
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,113
       Thyme.
     Bay leaves.

269
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:09,548
      Shallots.
       Basil.

270
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:10,815
    What do you call basil in...

271
00:09:10,918 --> 00:09:12,284
   Basil is basil.

272
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:14,219
I never use it before
     in Mexico.

273
00:09:14,321 --> 00:09:15,320
         No, I've never seen it.

274
00:09:15,422 --> 00:09:16,521
 I've never seen it
     in Mexico.

275
00:09:16,623 --> 00:09:18,023
             Okay, chili diablo
             We at least know --

276
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:19,324
        We know this one.
             -Yeah.

277
00:09:19,426 --> 00:09:22,360
            So we're just making
      a really nice, light broth

278
00:09:22,462 --> 00:09:23,862
           to poach the octopus.

279
00:09:23,964 --> 00:09:25,597
 Mexican octopus --
    wild octopus.

280
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:27,132
   -Wild octopus from Mexico.
         -Wild octopus.

281
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:29,301
     Let it cook
for like 45 minutes.

282
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:30,435
                   Got it.

283
00:09:30,537 --> 00:09:31,736
   We already have
  the octopus done.

284
00:09:31,838 --> 00:09:33,138
We have to cool it down.

285
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,506
     Ice water.

286
00:09:34,608 --> 00:09:37,375
 Once it cools down all the way,
          take off all the skin.

287
00:09:37,477 --> 00:09:38,410
        Yes.

288
00:09:38,512 --> 00:09:39,444
               Slice it thin,
             put on the tostada.

289
00:09:39,546 --> 00:09:41,112
     -Put it in the tostada.
            -Got it.

290
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:42,347
                 Make it up.

291
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:45,116
        Cucumbers,
red bell peppers, radishes,

292
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:46,885
heirloom cherry tomatoes.

293
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:48,687
      This is all the chef stuff
              coming out.

294
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:51,389
 It isn't just chopped tomatoes
 like you have in pico de gallo.

295
00:09:51,491 --> 00:09:53,024
     Red onion.
      Cilantro.

296
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:54,159
                    Okay.

297
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:55,160
      Cilantro --
If you're a Mexican --

298
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:56,328
          It's the state flower,
                  buddy.

299
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,964
 That's what it is.
  Sea salt. Pepper.

300
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:02,500
Lime juice for acid.

301
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:04,402
          And this is made fresh
           every time like this.

302
00:10:04,504 --> 00:10:05,770
 Every -- By order.

303
00:10:05,872 --> 00:10:08,340
         This market is slamming
            and jamming and busy

304
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:10,241
             and there's a line
              out of the place

305
00:10:10,344 --> 00:10:12,944
and he's taking it and making it
             to order each time.

306
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:14,579
 Then you get ready
    to plate it.

307
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:16,081
                    Okay.

308
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:21,620
        Really impressive, chef.

309
00:10:21,722 --> 00:10:24,556
                  Gorgeous.

310
00:10:24,658 --> 00:10:26,057
        Yeah.

311
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:28,293
          I'm getting the tomato
 and I'm getting the bell pepper

312
00:10:28,395 --> 00:10:30,295
       and I'm getting the onion
    and I'm getting the cilantro

313
00:10:30,397 --> 00:10:32,497
             and I'm getting all
      of these flavors together.

314
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:35,867
 This right here is taking what
 you've learned becoming a chef,

315
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,969
               along with your
             Mexican traditions,

316
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:39,004
        and it's delicious, man.

317
00:10:39,106 --> 00:10:41,206
                  Look at
          that bite right there.

318
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:43,074
Here's the Octopus Tostada.

319
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:45,377
   The octopus is very tender
           and tasty,

320
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:46,845
       seasoned properly.

321
00:10:46,947 --> 00:10:48,413
        MAN: It's spicy.
          It's lemon-y.

322
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:50,215
           It's tangy.
           It's fresh.

323
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:51,883
    It has good presentation.

324
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:55,053
             FIERI:
  That's because Chef Fernando
  doesn't skimp on the details.

325
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:56,321
      Where are the plates from?

326
00:10:56,423 --> 00:10:58,423
They're from Capula,
Michoacan, in Mexico.

327
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:00,125
         You had these specially
           made in Michoacan?

328
00:11:00,227 --> 00:11:01,259
        Yeah.

329
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:02,394
 I think you know in
 restaurant business

330
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:04,829
  you have to have
 not just the food.

331
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:07,332
  It's experience.
   See this tile?

332
00:11:07,434 --> 00:11:09,501
   Made in Mexico.
     The boards?

333
00:11:09,603 --> 00:11:10,802
   Made in Mexico.

334
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:12,037
              I love this guy.

335
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:13,938
             SERVER:
   Here's the Octopus Tostada.

336
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,607
   WOMAN: All these different
          food options,

337
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:17,509
          but this one
      definitely stood out.

338
00:11:17,611 --> 00:11:19,010
        Here's what's happening.

339
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:20,879
      We're hanging out at Grand
  Central Market in Los Angeles.

340
00:11:20,981 --> 00:11:22,547
               This chef --
          a guy you got to meet.

341
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:24,749
           Come back.
The Patrona Burger's on its way.

342
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:26,384
Patrona Burgers out!

343
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:29,387
   It's fresh, it's flavorful,
  and it's everything you could

344
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:31,389
          possibly want
      in a seafood burger.

345
00:11:31,491 --> 00:11:34,159
          The tostada, though --
          It's gonna be as good?

346
00:11:34,261 --> 00:11:36,094
       -Better than that.
           -We'll see.

347
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:44,235
                     ♪

348
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:45,570
                Welcome back.

349
00:11:45,672 --> 00:11:48,606
          I am hanging out at La
  Tostadería with Chef Fernando.

350
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:50,709
          This guy's got a story
             that you will love.

351
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:53,645
      Comes from Mexico, goes to
       Canada, opens a taqueria,

352
00:11:53,747 --> 00:11:55,080
                comes down to
             the United States,

353
00:11:55,182 --> 00:11:57,582
     opens a carnitas joint here
        in Grand Central Market,

354
00:11:57,684 --> 00:11:59,217
   then goes to culinary school,

355
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:01,219
             elevates himself
           in the world of food,

356
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:03,455
                and opens up
               La Tostadería.

357
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:05,557
  WOMAN: Really fresh seafood,
       great ingredients,

358
00:12:05,659 --> 00:12:07,826
    and they definitely take
  their time with every plate.

359
00:12:07,928 --> 00:12:10,095
           It's a cross between
           a great ceviche joint

360
00:12:10,197 --> 00:12:12,330
              and a taco stand,
              a tostada stand.

361
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:14,899
             So, he tells me
         that he makes a burger.

362
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:16,401
         VILLAGOMEZ:
Patrona Burger at the window.

363
00:12:16,503 --> 00:12:17,702
 The Patrona Burger's delicious.

364
00:12:17,804 --> 00:12:20,405
     A combination of cheese
      and shrimp and aioli.

365
00:12:20,507 --> 00:12:22,307
      It's not your typical
        seafood burger --

366
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:23,875
      what you get in a lot
      of other restaurants.

367
00:12:23,977 --> 00:12:25,577
        It can't be beat.
         It's delicious.

368
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:27,746
             He says if I don't
              love the burger,

369
00:12:27,848 --> 00:12:30,181
       he's gonna buy free lunch
           for all my crew.

370
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:32,684
             I hate the burger.

371
00:12:32,786 --> 00:12:33,718
        All right, what's first?

372
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,855
      Okay, mango,
red bell pepper, chives.

373
00:12:36,957 --> 00:12:37,756
           And then...

374
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:39,090
               Let me guess --
                  cilantro.

375
00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:40,558
      Cilantro.
      Exactly.

376
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,227
     I can't believe your middle
          name's not "Cilantro."

377
00:12:45,499 --> 00:12:46,598
                    Okay.

378
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,100
Avocados from the capital
    of the avocado --

379
00:12:49,202 --> 00:12:50,535
     Michoacan.

380
00:12:50,637 --> 00:12:53,171
      You just drop Michoacan in
 as often as you can, don't you?

381
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,240
        -I love my state.
         -I know you do.

382
00:12:55,342 --> 00:12:57,809
 So you just toss it
    all together.

383
00:12:57,911 --> 00:12:59,477
                 All right,
            time for the burger?

384
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:01,679
Wild Mexican shrimp.

385
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:03,047
          -Not frozen.
           -No frozen.

386
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,749
             -Okay.
     -Makes big difference.

387
00:13:04,851 --> 00:13:05,917
        Makes a huge difference.

388
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:08,686
Salt, pepper, butter.

389
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:09,754
   The bun, also.

390
00:13:09,856 --> 00:13:11,122
This is Oaxaca cheese.

391
00:13:11,224 --> 00:13:13,691
           Oaxaca cheese is like
             jack mozzarella.

392
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:14,859
             -Yeah.
    -That's gonna be kind of

393
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:15,794
             what actually holds
           this burger together.

394
00:13:15,896 --> 00:13:16,928
        Yeah.

395
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,663
         It's like the duct tape
            of Mexican food.

396
00:13:18,765 --> 00:13:20,732
Now we got the buns.

397
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:22,167
                    Okay.

398
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:24,302
  And before culinary school, he
called that chipotle mayonnaise.

399
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:26,004
      Lettuce.
       Tomato.

400
00:13:26,106 --> 00:13:30,942
Now we have our shrimp cooked
with the Oaxaca cheese melting.

401
00:13:31,044 --> 00:13:32,043
       Onion.

402
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,212
      We gonna use
the avocado mango radish.

403
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:35,847
             As much as I think
            I'm gonna love this,

404
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:36,881
        I'm still gonna tell you

405
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:39,384
              I hate it so you
            got to feed my crew.

406
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:40,552
            MAN: Yes!

407
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:44,322
This is for the crunchiness.

408
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:46,858
        Done.

409
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,227
       I haven't had to bust out
           the hunch in a while.

410
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:51,863
      This one might deserve it.

411
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:57,502
              I got good news,
             and I got bad news.

412
00:13:57,604 --> 00:13:58,403
      Tell me.

413
00:13:58,505 --> 00:13:59,938
               Good news is...

414
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,406
              that's fantastic.

415
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:05,276
      The bad news is the crew's
    hitting the vending machine.

416
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:08,112
  When you bite into it, you get
    the saltiness of the cheese,

417
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:09,347
      the texture of the cheese.

418

00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:15,153
           the shredded lettuce,
            the chipotle mayo,

        It's not frozen.

 All these extra little toppings

 that "wow" factor.

   You delivered.

   The Lobster Mac and Cheese.

484
00:16:24,918 --> 00:16:27,752
   It's lobster mac and cheese
 in between two pieces of bread.

485
00:16:27,854 --> 00:16:29,854
  The combination of the two --

  -So, what are we gonna make?
   -We're making The Hangover.

487
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:33,725
           We put mac and cheese
   inside of the grilled cheese,

488
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:36,361
           and special occasions
           we add lobster to it.

489
00:16:36,463 --> 00:16:38,896
Okay, we're making a bechamel
we're gonna add this cheese to.

00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:40,598
So go ahead and give me
  the breakdown here.

491
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,501
             Black truffle oil,
              shallots, garlic,

492
00:16:43,603 --> 00:16:46,938
           fresh thyme, a little
    chicken-based flour, slowly.

493
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,373
 -So you're building your roux.
             -Yeah.

494
00:16:48,475 --> 00:16:51,275
     We're gonna add the wine --
         3/4 of the bottle.

495
00:16:51,378 --> 00:16:54,345
      And then I drink the rest.

496
00:16:54,447 --> 00:16:56,848
                Heavy cream.

497
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:58,116
               Lots of cheese.

498
00:16:58,218 --> 00:16:59,150
Fontina, cheddar, and mozz.

499
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:00,351
             -Yeah.
            -Got it.

500
00:17:00,453 --> 00:17:02,854
             It'll start melting
            and doing its thing.

501
00:17:02,956 --> 00:17:05,123
       -What's its thing?
    -It starts getting gooey.

502
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:06,357
     Isn't that
  the melting part?

503
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:07,892
        That's the melting part.

504
00:17:07,994 --> 00:17:09,827
          Mix it with the pasta.

505
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:11,929
          Next step, we're gonna
             make the lobster.

506
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:13,398
             Butter.
             -Okay.

507
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,434

508
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:19,003

              Salt and pepper.

00:17:20,173 --> 00:17:21,272
Now we start to build
    the sandwich?

it's really worth it because
it builds a fantastic crust.

531
00:18:04,818 --> 00:18:05,817
       You did a good job.
           -Thank you.

532
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,385
You did a really good job.

533
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:10,121
It is the best mac and cheese
      I have ever had.

534
00:18:10,223 --> 00:18:11,856
FIERI: So, in case you don't
      know who this is.

535
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:15,493
It's the Internet sensation --
the Queen of Norfolk.

536
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:16,661
    This is Abby.

537
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,029
And what do you think
of this grilled cheese?

538
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:19,397
        It's super-gooey.

539
00:18:19,499 --> 00:18:21,432
 The bread adds a perfect crunch

540
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:24,035
   and actually a good amount
         of flavor, too.

541
00:18:24,137 --> 00:18:26,070
     The gooier the better.

542
00:18:26,172 --> 00:18:27,939
     Can you say
   "unemployment"?

543
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:31,008
As soon as she can drive,
        I'm done.

544
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:32,076
             WOMAN:
  This is absolutely the best.

545
00:18:32,178 --> 00:18:33,478
      Worth every calorie.

546
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:36,180
  FIERI: And the crazy thing is
   these calories are put out

547
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:37,715
         by a real-deal
          body builder.

548
00:18:37,817 --> 00:18:38,816
               I was dieting.

549
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:39,984
             I was getting ready
             for a competition.

550
00:18:40,086 --> 00:18:41,652
       I was craving some cheese
            and some bread.

551
00:18:41,754 --> 00:18:43,721
               That's how this
              concept started.

552
00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:45,756
 But it's not all carbolicious.

553
00:18:45,859 --> 00:18:47,658
      There's some veggies
     thrown in the mix, too.

554
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,093
       I have Don Quixote.

555
00:18:49,195 --> 00:18:51,529
        This sandwich is
     the vegetarian option.

556
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:54,565
   It's got mushrooms, olive.

557
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:56,734
Next up is going to be...

558
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:58,236
            Don Quixote Sandwich
               Grilled Cheese.

559
00:18:58,338 --> 00:18:59,370
   And why do you
    name it that?

560
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:01,506
             It has the little
          Mediterranean flavors.

561
00:19:01,608 --> 00:19:02,840
           It's a Spanish novel.

562
00:19:02,942 --> 00:19:05,810
           I just thought it was
     a brilliant name. [Laughs ]

563
00:19:05,912 --> 00:19:08,246
It wasn't just a good name --
      a brilliant name.

564
00:19:08,348 --> 00:19:09,547
              A brilliant name.

565
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:11,449
              We're gonna make
             the olive tapenade.

566
00:19:11,551 --> 00:19:14,485
         Olive oil, lemon juice,
           some kalamata olives.

567
00:19:14,587 --> 00:19:15,586
       Got it.

568
00:19:15,688 --> 00:19:16,621
            -Capers.
         -A ton of them.

569
00:19:16,723 --> 00:19:18,222
                  Parsley.
              A little garlic.

570
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:20,057
         Blend this up together,
             and it's done.

571
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,226
That's the olive tapenade.
All right, next step?

572
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:23,995
         Get our sandwich going.

573
00:19:24,097 --> 00:19:25,229
              Sourdough bread.

574
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:27,665
      Spread a little bit of our
        homemade olive tapenade,

575
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:30,067
    two slices of fontina cheese
            on each side.

576
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,702
            We're gonna get it
           covered a little bit.

577
00:19:31,804 --> 00:19:32,837
  One little dome.

578
00:19:32,939 --> 00:19:33,905
     Do you have more domes?
           -We have...

579
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:35,206
One little, two little,
    three little --

580
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:36,474
                ...20 domes.

581
00:19:36,576 --> 00:19:38,709
           We're going to put on
           our oyster mushrooms.

582
00:19:38,811 --> 00:19:39,777
             Caramelized onions.

583
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:41,345
            Roasted red peppers.

584
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:43,414
              Parmesan cheese.

585
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:45,349
                  It's got
             a nice toast to it.

586
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:47,985
               And it's ready.

587
00:19:48,087 --> 00:19:50,288
                There you go.

588
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,857
Great colors, caramelized
onions, oyster mushrooms,

589
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:55,493
roasted red bell peppers.

590
00:19:57,664 --> 00:20:00,198
This is a really nice,
mature grilled cheese.

591
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,566
   Caramelized onions,
boom, right off the bat,

592
00:20:01,668 --> 00:20:02,733
you're gonna get sweet.

593
00:20:02,835 --> 00:20:04,068
Roasted red bell pepper --
you're gonna get sweet.

594
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:07,405
But bringing in the acidity of
those capers and the kalamatas

595
00:20:07,507 --> 00:20:08,706
is where you really killed it.

596
00:20:08,808 --> 00:20:10,174
   Really good job.
And what was the name?

597
00:20:10,276 --> 00:20:11,209
                Don Quixote.

598
00:20:11,311 --> 00:20:12,376
 Yeah, but what type
   of name is it?

599
00:20:12,478 --> 00:20:14,779
           -It's a...
     -It's a brilliant name.

600
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:16,881
 Brilliant name for
a brilliant sandwich.

601
00:20:16,983 --> 00:20:19,317
    -Don Quixote. Excellent.
          -Nicely done.

602
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:21,552
            The oyster mushrooms
     with the roasted red pepper

603
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:23,754
       and the olive tapenade --
                 Whoo!

604
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:24,922
                  So good.

605
00:20:25,024 --> 00:20:26,891
       There's flavor down
        to the last bite.

606
00:20:26,993 --> 00:20:28,893
  Johnny Appleseed right here.

    the grilled cheese here.

I think if you're gonna have
    a grilled-cheese-ery,

609
00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:36,067
 you better deliver.
   You delivered.

610
00:20:36,169 --> 00:20:37,902
        -All right, cool.
           -Nice job.

611
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:41,772
      So, was this a great
       road trip or what?

612
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:43,074
      But don't you worry.

613
00:20:43,176 --> 00:20:45,810
I got plenty more joints to find
     all over this country.

614
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:47,345
         I'll be looking
        for you next time

            & Dives"!

616
00:20:50,316 --> 00:20:51,182
What else you got up
    your sleeve?

617
00:20:51,284 --> 00:20:52,617
        -The Don Quixote.
          -Don Quixote?

618
00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:54,285
                    Yeah.
                Not "donkey."

619
00:20:54,387 --> 00:20:55,386
 I have two donkeys.

620
00:20:55,488 --> 00:20:56,520
  Taco and Burrito.

621
00:20:56,623 --> 00:20:58,389
I thought you might have
 a donkey named "Hotay."

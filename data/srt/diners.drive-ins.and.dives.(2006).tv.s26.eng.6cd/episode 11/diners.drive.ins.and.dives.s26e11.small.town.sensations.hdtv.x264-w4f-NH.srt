1
00:00:01,068 --> 00:00:02,134
Hey, there.

2
00:00:02,136 --> 00:00:03,602
I'm Guy Fieri,
  and we're rolling out

3
00:00:03,604 --> 00:00:07,072
looking for America's greatest
 diners, drive-ins, and dives!

4
00:00:07,074 --> 00:00:08,207
This trip...

5
00:00:08,209 --> 00:00:09,708
Gimme a high-five.

6
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:11,276
...we're cruising
  out of the city...

7
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:13,412
- Are you ready?
  -I have my seatbelt on.

8
00:00:13,414 --> 00:00:16,248
...for a full hour
 of small-town standouts...

9
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,616
Just a little
   somethin' somethin'.

10
00:00:17,618 --> 00:00:20,185
...everything from
 an oldschool Wisconsin diner...

11
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:22,254
That is<i> really</i> good.

12
00:00:22,256 --> 00:00:24,156
...to a funky Salem shanty.

13
00:00:24,158 --> 00:00:26,058
Like we're making
    a witch's brew.

14
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:27,826
A quirky club in Alabama...

15
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:29,294
Wow, that's weird.

16
00:00:29,296 --> 00:00:31,597
...and a slope-side
   Park City café.

17
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,233
I can't say it's good.

18
00:00:34,235 --> 00:00:35,734
I can say it's great,
     though.

19
00:00:35,736 --> 00:00:38,103
Plus, a local legend
   in Carolina...

20
00:00:38,105 --> 00:00:39,738
You are a hero
 in this community.

21
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,306
...and a Tennessee joint

22
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:43,308
Here we go.
  turning up the heat.

23
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:44,643
Awesome.

24
00:00:44,645 --> 00:00:46,879
That's all right here,
   right now,

25
00:00:46,881 --> 00:00:49,415
on "Diners, Drive-ins & Dives."

26
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:00,426
I got a great story for ya.

27
00:01:00,428 --> 00:01:02,127
I'm here in Summerville,
  South Carolina,

28
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:04,496
about 20 miles west
   of Charleston.

29
00:01:04,498 --> 00:01:06,632
Now, this is where
  a local football star

30
00:01:06,634 --> 00:01:10,302
who goes on to play for Alabama
 has a career-ending injury.

31
00:01:10,304 --> 00:01:11,670
So what's he decide to do?

32
00:01:11,672 --> 00:01:13,639
Yep, come back to his hometown

33
00:01:13,641 --> 00:01:15,774
and open up exactly
  what they needed:

34
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,042
a hot dog joint.

35
00:01:17,044 --> 00:01:19,178
This is Perfectly Frank's.

36
00:01:20,514 --> 00:01:22,281
Frankie Elvis.
   French toast Frankie.

37
00:01:22,283 --> 00:01:24,316
I didn't know you could do
 so many things with a hot dog.

38
00:01:26,087 --> 00:01:27,786
So, what makes
  this place so good?

39
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:30,155
It's not only the food.
 Perry was the star quarterback

40
00:01:30,157 --> 00:01:34,726
on the high school football team
  in the late '70s.

41
00:01:34,728 --> 00:01:35,861
Order up!

42
00:01:35,863 --> 00:01:37,296
That'd be Perry Cuda,

43
00:01:37,298 --> 00:01:42,801
who drew up a whole new playbook
  for dogs back in '07.

44
00:01:42,803 --> 00:01:45,170
He has so many different things
 that he puts on a hot dog.

45
00:01:45,172 --> 00:01:47,706
Pulled pork.
 -Bananas and peanut butter
   and bacon.

46
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:48,974
Macaroni & cheese.

47
00:01:48,976 --> 00:01:50,909
Anything you can imagine
    on a hot dog.

48
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:52,411
All right,
    Frank Cuda dog up.

49
00:01:52,413 --> 00:01:53,912
I like the one he named
    after his dad,

50
00:01:53,914 --> 00:01:55,547
with the blue-cheese
     cole slaw.

51
00:01:57,418 --> 00:02:00,886
- What are we gonna make?
  -The Frank Cuda.

52
00:02:00,888 --> 00:02:02,187
So, this is named
   after your dad.

53
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:03,722
- It is.
- Okay, let's get into the chili.

54
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:04,890
- Okay.
   -Whose recipe?

55
00:02:04,892 --> 00:02:06,658
- My recipe.
  -First thing in, 80/20?

56
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:10,829
Yep, ground beef, diced onion,
 granulated garlic, cumin,

57
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:13,365
oregano.
  -Yes, sir. Brown sugar.

58
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:14,900
- Nice call.
   -Paprika.

59
00:02:14,902 --> 00:02:17,402
- Chili powder?
   -Chili powder.

60
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:20,305
A little yellow mustard,
 Worcestershire sauce, tabasco.

61
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:25,344
Crushed tomatoes,
   and cinnamon.

62
00:02:25,346 --> 00:02:28,981
Red-chili flake,
  and some olive oil.

63
00:02:28,983 --> 00:02:30,449
How long you gonna
 let this cook down,

64
00:02:30,451 --> 00:02:31,650
'til that meat
 just breaks up

65
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:32,985
into little pieces,
   -Exactly.

66
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:34,653
- really nice and thin?
 -About 45 minutes to an hour.

67
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:36,255
What kind of dog
 we gonna put it on?

68
00:02:36,257 --> 00:02:37,589
- All-beef, skinless,

69
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:39,858
yeah, ready to go.

70
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,393
- What are we into now?
  -We're gonna make

71
00:02:41,395 --> 00:02:42,494
the blue-cheese cole slaw.

72
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:44,796
Shredded cabbage,
  shredded carrots.

73
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:46,098
No culinary classes
  for you,

74
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,466
just experimenting on
   -Oldschool.

75
00:02:47,468 --> 00:02:48,700
- your friends and family.
   -Exactly.

76
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:52,604
A little cole slaw dressing,
  mayonnaise, sugar,

77
00:02:52,606 --> 00:02:55,073
apple-cider vinegar,
   celery seed,

78
00:02:55,075 --> 00:02:57,676
salt, black pepper,
 and crumbled blue cheese.

79
00:02:57,678 --> 00:02:59,611
Then, we just mix it up
   by hand.

80
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:01,580
What other body part
would you mix it with?

81
00:03:01,582 --> 00:03:04,183
Well.
  -Gimme a high-five.

82
00:03:04,185 --> 00:03:05,617
Time to bring it
  together.

83
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:08,253
- To the fryer.
 -We're gonna fry the dog?

84
00:03:08,255 --> 00:03:10,155
Fry it up.
  Chili we made earlier.

85
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:14,793
Me like. Don't go
skimpy on the chili.

86
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:16,395
Mm-hmm-mm!

87
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:23,468
- Cheese sauce.
   -All right.

88
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,937
Fried applewood-
   smoked bacon.

89
00:03:24,939 --> 00:03:26,171
Not just bacon, it's

90
00:03:26,173 --> 00:03:27,372
fried bacon.
  -Fried bacon, correct.

91
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:29,308
Some of our blue-cheese slaw,
   crispy onions,

92
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:31,176
and that's the Frank Cuda dog.

93
00:03:34,982 --> 00:03:36,415
- Do I have any here?
    -No.

94
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:38,217
Not at all.
  -I like the dog.

95
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:39,685
I mean, you gotta start off
with a really good dog

96
00:03:39,687 --> 00:03:41,286
right off the bat.
 The chili's great.

97
00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:42,754
- Thank you.
  -Chili works perfect.

98
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:45,023
The crunchy onions,
of course, fantastic.

99
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:46,625
The slaw is
 nice and cool.

100
00:03:50,164 --> 00:03:51,830
Man! That's
a righteous dog, dude.

101
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:53,265
- Thank you.
  -Nice job, Perry.

102
00:03:53,267 --> 00:03:54,700
Thank you.

103
00:03:54,702 --> 00:03:56,368
- Frank Cuda?
   -Thank you.

104
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,837
Messy, but good.
  -Frankie Valli up!

105
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:02,374
And these dogs are almost
  as iconic as Perry.

106
00:04:02,376 --> 00:04:03,609
Look at that guy!

107
00:04:03,611 --> 00:04:05,444
Yeah.
    A lot thinner then.

108
00:04:05,446 --> 00:04:08,447
Perry hasn't just made
  good with hot dogs.

109
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:11,183
There's a whole lot
  more to this menu.

110
00:04:11,185 --> 00:04:14,453
salads, sandwiches, tacos.

111
00:04:14,455 --> 00:04:16,822
- Sweet-tea-marinated pork chop.
   -Awesome.

112
00:04:16,824 --> 00:04:18,991
I think it may
  be the best sandwich

113
00:04:18,993 --> 00:04:20,492
I ever put in my face.

114
00:04:20,494 --> 00:04:21,860
What's next in the adventure?

115
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:23,862
We're making red-eye
    gravy mayonnaise

116
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:26,064
to go on our fried
    pork-chop sandwich.

117
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:27,599
Red-eye gravy.
 Now, just so you understand,

118
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:29,968
although I do look
  like I'm full Cali,

119
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,903
my mom was from
   North Carolina.

120
00:04:31,905 --> 00:04:33,739
Red-eye gravy
  is like a religion.

121
00:04:33,741 --> 00:04:35,407
A little olive oil,
   country ham.

122
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:36,975
That's
 a country-desiac.

123
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:39,611
Brown sugar, garlic;
  some árbol chilies,

124
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:42,247
little Mexican chilies;
  strong black coffee.

125
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:44,249
So, we let this cook down,
 let it reduce.

126
00:04:44,251 --> 00:04:45,584
We take the ham blender.

127
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:47,686
We're gonna purée
the ham into the sauce?

128
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:50,355
We are.

129
00:04:53,193 --> 00:04:56,495
- All right.
 -Whisk up the red-eye gravy,

130
00:04:56,497 --> 00:04:58,230
red-eye gravy
  into the mayonnaise.

131
00:04:58,232 --> 00:04:59,765
- Let it chill?
  -Ready to smear.

132
00:04:59,767 --> 00:05:01,133
- So a little pork loin here.
    -Right.

133
00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:02,334
Take the cap off of it.

134
00:05:03,404 --> 00:05:04,770
and put it in the marinade.

135
00:05:04,772 --> 00:05:06,605
And the sweet tea, this is
like sweet tea you drink?

136
00:05:06,607 --> 00:05:08,874
- Sweet tea you drink.
 -How long we let it marinate?

137
00:05:08,876 --> 00:05:10,275
Six, twelve hours.

138
00:05:10,277 --> 00:05:11,376
You can do it overnight.
  It'll be better.

139
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:12,611
We're gonna make
  the seasoned breader

140
00:05:12,613 --> 00:05:14,446
for the fried
  pork-chop sandwich.

141
00:05:14,448 --> 00:05:16,048
Okay.

142
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,517
All-purpose flour, cornmeal,

143
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:21,586
pinch of salt,
 black pepper, and some thyme.

144
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:23,055
And we'll take it
 through the process here --

145
00:05:23,057 --> 00:05:24,589
the all-purpose flour.

146
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:27,993
Into the buttermilk,
then into the dredge.

147
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:28,994
Into the fryer?
  -Into the fryer.

148
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:30,295
And then,
we build the sandwich.

149
00:05:30,297 --> 00:05:32,097
We do. Toast the bun
  for the pork chop,

150
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:34,232
red-eye gravy mayonnaise,

151
00:05:34,234 --> 00:05:36,668
and a<i> good</i> helping of it.
   Lettuce.

152
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,936
All right, sounds like
 the pork's done.

153
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:40,505
Yep. Pork chop.

154
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:42,240
Tomato.
  -What's it called?

155
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:44,509
Sweet-tea-marinated
 fried pork-chop sandwich.

156
00:05:47,414 --> 00:05:48,780
The pork?

157
00:05:48,782 --> 00:05:50,382
Cooked perfectly.
 Not sweet --

158
00:05:50,384 --> 00:05:51,516
it's not sweet or anything.
    -Right.

159
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,085
I gotta say, the red-eye
 gravy mayonnaise

160
00:05:53,087 --> 00:05:54,553
is the bomb.

161
00:05:54,555 --> 00:05:56,088
It doesn't taste
 a ton like coffee.

162
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:57,923
You get the fattiness
 of the mayo.

163
00:05:57,925 --> 00:06:00,359
It's juicy,
it's got rich flavor,

164
00:06:00,361 --> 00:06:01,626
and what I think
is really cool about it

165
00:06:01,628 --> 00:06:03,729
is you're not a chef.
   -No. No.

166
00:06:03,731 --> 00:06:05,397
Don't claim to be.
  -You're just a dude

167
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:07,232
that loves good food.
 -Yep. Just wanted to bring

168
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:08,367
something different
   to Summerville.

169
00:06:08,369 --> 00:06:09,468
- That's good stuff.
   -Thank you.

170
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,802
- Nice job.
  -Thank you very much.

171
00:06:10,804 --> 00:06:12,304
Sweet-tea-marinated
     pork chop!

172
00:06:12,306 --> 00:06:14,139
Gets a little messy,
 but very good.

173
00:06:14,141 --> 00:06:15,774
Now, what do you think?
 He drags you out for dinner,

174
00:06:15,776 --> 00:06:17,542
and he takes you
  to a hot dog joint.

175
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:19,010
- We love it.
   -You are a hero

176
00:06:19,012 --> 00:06:20,912
in this community.
Summerville's lucky to have you.

177
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:22,280
Thank you.
   Thank you very much.

178
00:06:22,282 --> 00:06:23,415
Appreciate you coming.
 -Nice to meet you, Perry.

179
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:24,950
You're an awesome guy, man.
   -Thank you.

180
00:06:27,121 --> 00:06:30,889
Comin' up...Southern flavor
 in Franklin, Tennessee...

181
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,491
I like where
   you're going with it.

182
00:06:32,493 --> 00:06:33,759
from jammin' jambalaya...

183
00:06:33,761 --> 00:06:35,627
This'll make ya happy, man.

184
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:37,396
...to some chicken
   that's kickin'.

185
00:06:37,398 --> 00:06:39,631
That's where you let the
  funkalicious get in there.

186
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,108
I'm in Franklin, Tennessee,

187
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,944
about 15 minutes south
  of downtown Nashville,

188
00:06:52,946 --> 00:06:56,381
to check out a joint the people
 in the know say I gotta see.

189
00:06:56,383 --> 00:07:00,886
This is 55 South.

190
00:07:00,888 --> 00:07:03,188
Pork-chop sandwich.

191
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:05,524
There's no better place to be.
  Everything is perfect.

192
00:07:05,526 --> 00:07:07,492
Hot chicken,
 bag of shrimp.

193
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:08,727
The food is amazing.

194
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:11,196
It's different,
it's fresh, it's tasty.

195
00:07:11,198 --> 00:07:13,432
- BLT in the window.
  -Plenty of variety --

196
00:07:13,434 --> 00:07:14,800
that's what makes
   it really good.

197
00:07:14,802 --> 00:07:16,234
And all part
  of Jason McConnell's

198
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:17,569
personal road map.

199
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:20,539
A poli-sci grad
 turned off by DC politics

200
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:24,910
and turned on
  by Southern cookin'.

201
00:07:24,912 --> 00:07:29,281
And, in 2010, it all became part
  of the 55 South menu.

202
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:30,949
It's a little bit
 of everything.

203
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,851
Cajun, it's country,

204
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:35,854
it's a little bit
  of Memphis, Franklin.

205
00:07:35,856 --> 00:07:38,490
Even a local dish I like
 to get when I'm in town.

206
00:07:38,492 --> 00:07:39,658
Hot chicken.

207
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:42,327
The hot chicken knocks
 it out of the park.

208
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:44,596
It'll set you on fire.

209
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:45,897
What are we gonna
     make first?

210
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:48,166
We are going to make
  hot-chicken marinade.

211
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:49,901
- Marinade.
  -It's got a little twang,    you know?

212
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:51,736
- I'm throwin' twang at it.
  -You're doing good.

213
00:07:51,738 --> 00:07:53,171
We got a little paprika --

214
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:56,408
it's the base 'cause you wanna
  have red chicken.

215
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:59,211
We got salt, black pepper,

216
00:07:59,213 --> 00:08:03,048
Louisiana hot sauce, cayenne.

217
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:08,153
Granulated garlic, a little oil.

218
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:10,789
You wanna get
  this kind of going.

219
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:13,425
Got a little bit of water.
   This is paste.

220
00:08:13,427 --> 00:08:14,659
This is spackle.

221
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:18,997
That's the napalm.

222
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,699
If you can't afford
    pepper spray,

223
00:08:20,701 --> 00:08:22,467
just carry
    a handful of it

224
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:23,869
when you walk
    down a dark alley.

225
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:31,009
That look.
  -It's not that bad.

226
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,777
Awesome.
  -We're gonna marinade

227
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:35,947
<i> and</i> finish the chicken
  sandwich with this.

228
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:37,516
We're gonna save
  just a little bit.

229
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:38,984
We'll put the chicken in this.

230
00:08:38,986 --> 00:08:41,920
Old Ranger Danger over here
   took the chicken breast

231
00:08:41,922 --> 00:08:43,088
and it gave it
    a little score,

232
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:46,324
you know, just
    sucked it up.

233
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:48,226
Just gonna get
  the paste on it.

234
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:49,361
Now, how long
   would you really like

235
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:50,529
to let this marinate?

236
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:51,630
A couple of days.

237
00:08:54,268 --> 00:08:55,867
Now, we're gonna
    make the dredge.

238
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:58,904
We got some flour with
 a little bacon powder in it,

239
00:08:58,906 --> 00:09:02,674
granulated garlic,
  just a little paprika.

240
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:04,876
We really wanna get
  some colors in that.

241
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,912
Cayenne, Creole seasoning.

242
00:09:06,914 --> 00:09:09,047
And more salt.
    -Okay.

243
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:13,485
Kind of an all-purpose
    Cajun dredge.

244
00:09:13,487 --> 00:09:15,453
And then, we've got
  our atomic chicken.

245
00:09:17,658 --> 00:09:19,658
We got the oil.
   -Got the oil.

246
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,527
- We're just gonna lay that in.
- No dropping these into a fryer.

247
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:25,030
No, you gotta go
  with the skillet. 375.

248
00:09:25,032 --> 00:09:26,331
- Three to five minutes?
    -Yeah.

249
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:31,903
The key here is that
   score to that breast.

250
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:33,572
That's where you let the
  funkalicious get in there.

251
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:36,775
- So, we're good.
    -Okay.

252
00:09:36,777 --> 00:09:38,810
So, we're gonna do
  a little white bread.

253
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:41,546
- White bread.
 -Little mayo, a little --

254
00:09:41,548 --> 00:09:42,681
- little schmear.
  -A little schmear.

255
00:09:42,683 --> 00:09:44,416
- Two pieces.
    -Two?!

256
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:47,419
I'm not gonna fit
    in my swimsuit.

257
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:49,087
A breast, a breast.

258
00:09:51,058 --> 00:09:52,657
You're gonna put more
    of that on there?

259
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:54,759
Enough already.

260
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,528
That's the way you normally
    make it for people?

261
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:59,364
Yeah, it's a perfect amount.
 This is a key component.

262
00:09:59,366 --> 00:10:03,068
Gotta have lots of pickles.

263
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:05,036
And always, you know,
 you gotta give it the --

264
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:07,739
bring it all together.

265
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:09,708
A lot more
   than I bargained for.

266
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,676
Just a little
   somethin' somethin'.

267
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:12,978
Here we go!

268
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:17,916
Not hot.

269
00:10:17,918 --> 00:10:19,250
Do I have any here?

270
00:10:19,252 --> 00:10:22,520
Not here or here,
   but like right here.

271
00:10:22,522 --> 00:10:23,755
- A little.
   -Little bit?

272
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:26,224
But you're good.

273
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:28,159
The chicken
    is super-tender.

274
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:29,628
There's great crunch,
    nice texture

275
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:30,495
on the outside of it.

276
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:31,963
Not overly done
    with batter.

277
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,098
The pickles
    are the only thing

278
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,367
that are gonna
    save your life.

279
00:10:35,369 --> 00:10:37,569
Chef, awesome job.

280
00:10:37,571 --> 00:10:38,837
Definitely spicy.

281
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:41,606
Slightly peppery, good
  crunch, texture, flavor --

282
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:43,375
this has got it all.
    Outstanding.

283
00:10:43,377 --> 00:10:46,244
This gentleman right here
 is Lori Arnett's husband.

284
00:10:47,381 --> 00:10:49,280
Oh, he also happens
  to be Jeff Arnett,

285
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:51,383
master distiller.

286
00:10:51,385 --> 00:10:53,451
And libations
  are just one thing

287
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:55,387
that anchors folks
   to this place.

288
00:10:55,389 --> 00:10:58,690
I love cold drinks,
  and 55 South provides me

289
00:10:58,692 --> 00:11:00,325
with something cool
     to drink.

290
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:04,496
It's kind of a Cajun
    Cheers, I guess.

291
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:06,364
- Cheers.

292
00:11:08,602 --> 00:11:10,802
I'm still sweatin'
 after the chicken sandwich

293
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:12,270
that we had.
  -Keeps you young.

294
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:14,205
If something makes you
   young, it's jambalaya.

295
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:16,641
- This is real-deal.
  -I'm just telling ya.

296
00:11:16,643 --> 00:11:18,376
So, what are we...?
   In your jambalaya --

297
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:20,645
Mine, I like to do
  pork butt, chicken thighs,

298
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:22,213
smoked sausage --
    holy trinity.

299
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:23,515
I mean,
   I go the whole gambit.

300
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:24,949
Is that where we're going?
  -Chicken and andouille.

301
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:26,117
Chicken and andouille.

302
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:28,987
We make the andouille here.

303
00:11:28,989 --> 00:11:30,488
- You make the sausage?
    -We do.

304
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,390
Of course you do.

305
00:11:34,628 --> 00:11:35,994
The mise is ready.

306
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:37,962
First thing, you got
  a hot pan over here,

307
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:42,033
put some blended oil in,
   chicken.

308
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,468
This is breast.

309
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,570
We're gonna get that
 going just for a second.

310
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:47,839
Got some celery,

311
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:49,040
bell pepper, on-ion,

312
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:50,208
a little garlic.

313
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,910
- Lovin' it.
 -Let that go for a second.

314
00:11:51,912 --> 00:11:53,378
Really, just kind of
  breaking up the chicken

315
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,014
in there a little bit.
   -I gotcha.

316
00:11:56,016 --> 00:11:58,316
We're gonna cut up
  some of this andouille.

317
00:11:58,318 --> 00:11:59,484
Look at that.

318
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,056
So, we got the sausage
   going in.

319
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:06,458
I like the way
    this looks, man.

320
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,293
We're gonna do
  some dried thyme,

321
00:12:08,295 --> 00:12:10,628
basil, oregano,

322
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,963
chopped Italian parsley.

323
00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:14,032
- Hot sauce?
 -Some Louisiana hot sauce.

324
00:12:14,034 --> 00:12:15,467
Creole.
    -Yep.

325
00:12:15,469 --> 00:12:16,735
I like where
   you're going with it.

326
00:12:16,737 --> 00:12:18,570
And then, we're gonna
   do our liquids:

327
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:22,173
tomato juice, chicken stock,

328
00:12:22,175 --> 00:12:25,176
a little bit
  of crushed tomatoes.

329
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:27,145
Got a little simmer going on.

330
00:12:27,147 --> 00:12:30,648
We're gonna add
  some long-grain rice.

331
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,951
And now you can't leave
   'til it's over.

332
00:12:32,953 --> 00:12:35,386
We're just gonna let that simmer
 'til all the rice absorbs

333
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:38,623
the liquid, and that's it.

334
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:39,758
If you gotta make
    any phone calls,

335
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,093
check your emails, I can
  watch the pot for a bit.

336
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:46,030
Looks awesome.

337
00:12:46,032 --> 00:12:47,298
Good color.

338
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,667
Lot of product,
    lot of sausage.

339
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:55,306
And a little extra hot sauce
   on the top,

340
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:57,075
some fresh scallions, that's it.

341
00:12:57,077 --> 00:12:58,209
That's all she wrote.

342
00:13:01,815 --> 00:13:03,014
What we have here

343
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:06,851
is real-deal jambalaya.

344
00:13:06,853 --> 00:13:08,019
Not too spicy.

345
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:10,555
The really nice piece

346
00:13:10,557 --> 00:13:11,723
is the andouille.

347
00:13:11,725 --> 00:13:13,291
Great smoke coming
   out of that.

348
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,960
But that's the little element
 that pushes it over the top.

349
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:17,028
It just makes
  all the difference.

350
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,696
The rice is tender.

351
00:13:18,698 --> 00:13:20,298
Little scallion
   on the outside,

352
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,634
nice round heat coming
 from that Cajun seasoning

353
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:24,536
and the spices you put in.

354
00:13:24,538 --> 00:13:26,004
This'll make you happy, man.

355
00:13:26,006 --> 00:13:27,705
My friend.

356
00:13:29,776 --> 00:13:33,244
Chicken-and-sausage
  jambalaya.

357
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:34,946
It's so good.

358
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:37,282
- It's not too spicy.
- It's just perfect.

359
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:38,716
It's good to know
  that we won't have

360
00:13:38,718 --> 00:13:40,118
to just travel down
  to New Orleans now

361
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,786
to enjoy some
   good jambalaya.

362
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:42,921
You see?

363
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:47,926
Up next...
  a small-town treasure

364
00:13:47,928 --> 00:13:49,260
in Daphne, Alabama.

365
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:51,162
- Don't tell anybody!
   -I won't. Shh!

366
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,997
- You're putting us on the map.
   -Part bar...

367
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:55,333
You are the Bloody Mary
    capital of Alabama?

368
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:56,301
The world.

369
00:13:56,303 --> 00:13:57,468
...part po' boys...

370
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:00,238
You rotate up
     and in.

371
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,973
...and full-fledged crazy.

372
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:04,175
I can't keep up!

373
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:10,081
Back in '36,
  a guy named Frank Manci

374
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:12,116
started serving beer
  in his gas station.

375
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:14,385
Now, over the years,
  the pumps went away,

376
00:14:14,387 --> 00:14:16,921
but the place became
 a local legendary hangout.

377
00:14:16,923 --> 00:14:18,656
Now, three generations later,

378
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:20,458
people say things
  are better than ever,

379
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:23,695
a real unique experience that
 they just can't quite explain.

380
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:25,663
So with that said,
  I gotta check out

381
00:14:25,665 --> 00:14:27,232
Manci's Antique Club.

382
00:14:27,234 --> 00:14:28,366
Overwhelming.

383
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:30,068
You don't know
what you're walking into.

384
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,703
Every time you come in,
   you see something new.

385
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:33,905
I'm actually just
  a little freaked out.

386
00:14:33,907 --> 00:14:35,139
But not by the food.

387
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:36,541
- Here's your medium steak.
   -Thank you.

388
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,042
Love it.
 It's awesome.

389
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:40,478
It has been at this
 Daphne, Alabama institution

390
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,046
for 83 years.
    Mmm!

391
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:44,616
Wow, that's good!
  Especially since '94...

392
00:14:44,618 --> 00:14:46,284
- That's looking good.
  -when Gwen Manci

393
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:48,052
started serving a full menu
    -Mmm!

394
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:50,622
- at her husband, Alex's, bar,
   -Thank you.

395
00:14:50,624 --> 00:14:52,891
getting back to something
  she's always loved.

396
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:55,360
My father owned
 a few drive-ins,

397
00:14:55,362 --> 00:14:57,061
and he's been having me
 cook beside him

398
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:59,597
ever since I was
  about 13.

399
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:01,599
Now, she's serving up
   Gulf oysters,

400
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:02,967
piled-high burgers...

401
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:05,069
Go at it too fast,
it'll collapse on ya.

402
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:06,571
...a steak sandwich
   to the max...

403
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:08,239
A lot of great
    stuff on it.

404
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:11,442
...and their signature dish.
  When they say --

405
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:14,379
They say, "Give me
 a seafood po' boy."

406
00:15:14,381 --> 00:15:16,347
Shrimp po' boy.
    It's delicious.

407
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:18,950
Humongous.
    Fresh, wonderful.

408
00:15:18,952 --> 00:15:21,719
- I am the queen.
 -You are po' boy royalty.

409
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:23,888
There you go.
 Are you ready?

410
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:26,324
- I have my seatbelt on.
  -All right, let's fly.

411
00:15:26,326 --> 00:15:27,592
This is gonna be my dredge.

412
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:28,893
You're gonna start
   with some milk.

413
00:15:28,895 --> 00:15:31,329
- Chug your eggs, Rocky.
 -Just kinda lightly mix.

414
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:32,931
Then, it's gonna be
  a little bit easier

415
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:34,499
and hopefully not so messy.

416
00:15:34,501 --> 00:15:36,367
I'm right here
  behind the safety shield.

417
00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:37,902
- All right.
 -So, a little hot sauce.

418
00:15:37,904 --> 00:15:39,537
And then, we have
   a little beer.

419
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:41,372
That was full when
   we started the show.

420
00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:42,573
No, I refilled.

421
00:15:43,877 --> 00:15:45,276
I can't keep up!

422
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:46,844
Dry mix over here.
    Flour.

423
00:15:46,846 --> 00:15:48,680
- Pepper.
   -Just a pinch.

424
00:15:48,682 --> 00:15:50,448
A couple pinches.
   Maybe one more.

425
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,016
That's four pinches
     exactly.

426
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:53,952
- Yes.
  -Some Cajun seasoning?

427
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:55,987
- You're right!
 -It's not my first rodeo.

428
00:15:55,989 --> 00:15:58,222
I can tell.
  Blend it all together.

429
00:15:58,224 --> 00:16:00,625
All right, we're through
 with the dry ingredients.

430
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:02,727
We're gonna do it
 with a wet and dry hand.

431
00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:04,295
- I wanna see it. Look at this.
    -Yes.

432
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:05,964
You're holding it
   like you're a doctor.

433
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:07,131
Aahhh!

434
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,232
Deveined,
    and it looks like

435
00:16:08,234 --> 00:16:09,634
a little bit
   of a butterfly on that.

436
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:10,868
- Yes.
  -So they lay down nice.

437
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:13,638
Yes. Then we're gonna put 'em
   back into this.

438
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,007
- And how many...?
 -Eight shrimp go in a po' boy.

439
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:18,009
- Thank you.
   -See? Wet, dry.

440
00:16:18,011 --> 00:16:19,310
- Look at you!
    -Yes!

441
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:20,478
Pluck 'em all out.
   So, you did wet, dry,

442
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,080
and then
    what'd you just do?

443
00:16:22,082 --> 00:16:23,414
My hands aren't that big,
   so I can't.

444
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:26,084
You could've got yourself
    a little plate.

445
00:16:26,086 --> 00:16:27,485
- Oh, I didn't wanna --
   -Young Jedi,

446
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,921
you have to stay
    in the training.

447
00:16:29,923 --> 00:16:31,422
I know.

448
00:16:31,424 --> 00:16:33,291
And you don't wanna put 'em
 all on top of each other.

449
00:16:33,293 --> 00:16:36,561
They gotta have their own
 little separate places to cook.

450
00:16:36,563 --> 00:16:38,129
We got our buttered
   po' boy bun.

451
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:39,931
Okay. Now, what's gonna go
 on the po' boy?

452
00:16:39,933 --> 00:16:41,866
We do everything
  with tartar sauce.

453
00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:43,768
So it's mayonnaise,
    pickle relish,

454
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:45,503
white onions, red onions,
    and then capers.

455
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:46,738
- Just a little bit of caper.
    -Yes.

456
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,307
And it makes that shrimp
   taste whoo!

457
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:50,742
It makes the shrimp
    taste whoo!?

458
00:16:50,744 --> 00:16:51,709
You want me
 to grab the shrimp?

459
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:53,277
- Yes, thank you.
   -Yahtzee!

460
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,380
- Yahtzee!
    -Ready?

461
00:16:56,883 --> 00:16:59,384
Mmm! Wow.
 When you say a po' boy --

462
00:16:59,386 --> 00:17:01,753
when you look in a dictionary,
 that should be the picture.

463
00:17:01,755 --> 00:17:03,855
You taste the great shrimp,
 you taste the fresh veggies,

464
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:06,391
the crunch of the lettuce,
  served on a nice roll.

465
00:17:06,393 --> 00:17:09,460
That's some really good
 tartar sauce.

466
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:10,928
Big explosion of happy.

467
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:13,664
- And all kinds of po' boys.
  -Oyster po' boy.

468
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:16,267
oysters and shrimp.

469
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:17,502
This is
a spider sandwich.

470
00:17:17,504 --> 00:17:19,303
It's always good.

471
00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:21,906
It's really a softshell-
   crab po' boy.

472
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:23,274
It does look like a spider.

473
00:17:23,276 --> 00:17:25,643
The legs and everything hang
 off, and you eat it whole.

474
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:28,012
You know the stance.
    Wanna learn?

475
00:17:28,014 --> 00:17:29,714
- Sure, let's go.
  -Get this hand --

476
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:32,016
you gotta get this
   hand ready under here.

477
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:34,419
You get this one
     over here.

478
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:40,124
And then you rotate up
     and in.

479
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:45,063
Wow, that's good!
 The reason you're doing it

480
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:47,065
is so you don't get
 your bowling shirt messed up.

481
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:48,833
- Oh! I see.
   -You see this?

482
00:17:48,835 --> 00:17:50,068
You see how this whole thing's
  working right here?

483
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:54,906
- Mm-hmm.

484
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:57,708
Mm, that is good.

485
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,544
- That just works.
  -Doesn't it work?

486
00:17:59,546 --> 00:18:01,212
Everything blends together.
   -It does.

487
00:18:01,214 --> 00:18:03,147
Kinda like the decor.

488
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:05,049
It's just a mishmash
of every weird thing

489
00:18:05,051 --> 00:18:06,417
you could ever think of.

490
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:07,752
Your dad put all this in.

491
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:10,121
I put stuff in it, too,
but he put the majority.

492
00:18:10,123 --> 00:18:12,557
The biggest thing
  Alex put in this joint?

493
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,025
I'll have the Bloody Mary,
  obviously.

494
00:18:14,027 --> 00:18:16,360
You are the Bloody Mary
  capital of Alabama?

495
00:18:16,362 --> 00:18:17,995
- The world.
  -It's wonderful.

496
00:18:17,997 --> 00:18:19,230
And to go with the drink...

497
00:18:19,232 --> 00:18:21,065
- Cheers!
  -You need to flip.

498
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:23,267
- You know what you're gonna get.
 -...from hand-cut steaks...

499
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:24,702
It's delicious.
 It's very juicy.

500
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:25,970
...and fresh-grilled shrimp,

501
00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:27,972
to something called
   a Jazzy Burger,

502
00:18:27,974 --> 00:18:30,108
topped with a local
   favorite sauce.

503
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,542
Jezebel sauce?
   -You bet.
    -Yeah.

504
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:33,845
I use ground horseradish
   from the root.

505
00:18:33,847 --> 00:18:36,114
That gives it that extra kick.

506
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:37,782
Dried prepared
    mustard, okay.

507
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:39,450
What is that
    gelatinous fun?

508
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:40,651
This is apple jelly.

509
00:18:40,653 --> 00:18:42,520
Not something I see
    cooked with a lot.

510
00:18:42,522 --> 00:18:44,322
Wait until you see
  the next ingredients.

511
00:18:44,324 --> 00:18:46,023
Pineapple preserves.

512
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:47,892
Does kitchen sink
    come in soon?

513
00:18:47,894 --> 00:18:50,194
Right at the end.
   Black pepper.

514
00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:52,263
Don't be scared.
 Make sure you get plenty.

515
00:18:52,265 --> 00:18:54,232
Now, put your lettuce, tomato,
  and onion on there.

516
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:55,366
We've got an opening,

517
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:57,034
if you'd like to fill out
   an application.

518
00:18:57,036 --> 00:18:58,436
I have an opening, too,
  and I plan

519
00:18:58,438 --> 00:19:00,138
on shoving this
 Jazzy Burger in it.

520
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,572
All right.

521
00:19:01,574 --> 00:19:03,841
Just go jazzy
with that Jazzy sauce.

522
00:19:03,843 --> 00:19:05,776
Do the stance.

523
00:19:05,778 --> 00:19:07,612
Let's do the stance.

524
00:19:07,614 --> 00:19:09,213
Do your own show!

525
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,353
Quite different, isn't it?

526
00:19:15,355 --> 00:19:17,522
Yeah.

527
00:19:17,524 --> 00:19:19,790
Wow, that's weird!

528
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:21,259
I mean, it's good.
    Don't get me wrong.

529
00:19:21,261 --> 00:19:24,462
It's good, but it is
    tangy and spicy.

530
00:19:24,464 --> 00:19:26,998
It's sweet; it's sour.

531
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,800
This is the
 craziest sauce I've ever had.

532
00:19:29,802 --> 00:19:31,502
It's kind of sweet<i> and</i> spicy.

533
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:34,005
- There we go.
 -Food's always been good.

534
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:35,473
It just gets better
 all the time.

535
00:19:35,475 --> 00:19:37,308
Other places don't have
 the quirkiness

536
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:39,844
that this place has.
  -Best-kept secret.

537
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:40,878
Well.

538
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,979
'Til now.

539
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:43,481
It is. But don't
    tell anybody!

540
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:45,650
- I won't. Shh!
 -You're putting us on the map.

541
00:19:45,652 --> 00:19:48,319
Coming up on this
 small-town power hour...

542
00:19:48,321 --> 00:19:51,189
Wow!
  Cold-weather comfort
  in Park City, Utah...

543
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:54,192
You got sweet and heat,
   on meat you can't beat.

544
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:56,494
...and a spot servin'
  double-diamond dishes.

545
00:19:56,496 --> 00:20:00,264
Good Mexican-Texan-
    Southern combo

546
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:01,732
with a twist, elevated.
   Real easy to explain.

547
00:20:08,841 --> 00:20:12,009
I'm here at Park City, Utah,
 at the Silver Star Village,

548
00:20:12,011 --> 00:20:14,412
which is right at the base
 of Park City Mountain Resort.

549
00:20:14,414 --> 00:20:15,713
Now, I know that's a mouthful,

550
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:17,014
but I want you
  to find this place,

551
00:20:17,016 --> 00:20:19,016
'cause I hear they're doing
 way more than you'd find

552
00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:20,184
at your average ski lodge.

553
00:20:20,186 --> 00:20:25,089
This is the Silver Star Cafe.

554
00:20:25,091 --> 00:20:27,458
Got a sea bass
   and osso buco for 112.

555
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:30,061
<i> The</i> best place to eat
in Park City, bar none.

556
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:32,096
- And braised truffle.
 -There really is something

557
00:20:32,098 --> 00:20:33,397
that makes this place special

558
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,199
n Park City,
  and it's Jeff and Lisa.

559
00:20:35,201 --> 00:20:37,401
That would be veterans
  of the local food biz

560
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:38,736
Jeff and Lisa Ward.

561
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:40,204
I've been doing restaurants
 in town for a long time.

562
00:20:40,206 --> 00:20:42,673
We've never owned one ourselves.
  We took the plunge.

563
00:20:42,675 --> 00:20:44,775
That was in 2010,

564
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:46,811
when they took over
 this joint at the bottom

565
00:20:46,813 --> 00:20:49,480
of the Silver Star chair lift.
  -We're a local joint,

566
00:20:49,482 --> 00:20:51,349
but we resonate with
 the destination visitor.

567
00:20:51,351 --> 00:20:56,387
Thanks to an eclectic menu,
 cooked up by Chef Dave Bible.

568
00:20:56,389 --> 00:20:58,089
Comfort food brought
to a higher level --

569
00:20:58,091 --> 00:21:00,358
it's familiar,
but with some twists to it.

570
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,759
I have the pork osso buco.

571
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:03,427
- Pork osso buco
    -Right.

572
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:04,862
with tomatillo salsa.
   -Yes, sir.

573
00:21:04,864 --> 00:21:06,364
- Mexican-Italian.
    -Yes.

574
00:21:06,366 --> 00:21:09,500
The first thing we're gonna make
 is the roasted-tomatillo salsa.

575
00:21:09,502 --> 00:21:11,736
Start off with some oil
   in the pan.

576
00:21:11,738 --> 00:21:15,506
Chopped onions, tomatillos,

577
00:21:15,508 --> 00:21:17,341
poblano chilies,

578
00:21:17,343 --> 00:21:21,178
salt, pepper.

579
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,314
We'll cook these
  for about 20 minutes.

580
00:21:23,316 --> 00:21:25,182
All the vegetables are cooked.
  Add chicken stock.

581
00:21:25,184 --> 00:21:26,350
It's a roasted-chicken stock,

582
00:21:26,352 --> 00:21:27,785
and I use tomato paste
  to kind of get like

583
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:29,453
a brown.
   -I got you.

584
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:31,555
And then, just Bermix it.

585
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:34,792
Your tomatillo
    salsa's done now.

586
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:36,260
Now, we're gonna start
  our pork shanks.

587
00:21:36,262 --> 00:21:37,595
First thing I'm gonna do
  is season 'em --

588
00:21:37,597 --> 00:21:39,664
lots of salt and pepper.
 A little bit of oil the pan.

589
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:41,432
Throw a little vegetable on here
  so these will roast

590
00:21:41,434 --> 00:21:42,833
at the same time
  as the pork rounds,

591
00:21:42,835 --> 00:21:44,235
and then I place the pork.

592
00:21:46,205 --> 00:21:47,305
And we're gonna roast
   these off in the oven

593
00:21:47,307 --> 00:21:49,707
at what temp?
 -Right about 560 degrees,

594
00:21:49,709 --> 00:21:51,208
about seven or eight minutes.

595
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,910
- So, we're done being roasted?
   -Yes, sir.

596
00:21:52,912 --> 00:21:56,447
So, I'm gonna place them
   into the pan.

597
00:21:56,449 --> 00:21:58,215
Flip the veg through the pan.

598
00:21:58,217 --> 00:22:00,484
- Homemade chicken stock?
    -Yep.

599
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:02,920
Foil this back up, put it
   back in the pizza oven?

600
00:22:02,922 --> 00:22:05,523
Yes, sir, for three hours.
 It's like Christmas morning.

601
00:22:05,525 --> 00:22:07,825
So, we've got these yellow grits
  spiked with chipotles.

602
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:09,627
Dude, my middle
   name's chipotle grit.

603
00:22:09,629 --> 00:22:11,796
Gorgeous.
- Put one of the shanks on there.

604
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:14,899
Got that tomatillo salsa
 already hot, ready to roll.

605
00:22:14,901 --> 00:22:17,301
Just a little garnish
  of queso fresco,

606
00:22:17,303 --> 00:22:19,270
just a little bit
  of chopped cilantro,

607
00:22:19,272 --> 00:22:21,072
and there we are.
 That's the pork osso buco,

608
00:22:21,074 --> 00:22:22,206
roasted-tomatillo salsa.

609
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:29,747
Outrageous.

610
00:22:29,749 --> 00:22:31,882
Nice acidity
  in the tomatillo salsa.

611
00:22:31,884 --> 00:22:33,551
Porks fall apart, tender.

612
00:22:33,553 --> 00:22:35,486
Love the poblano note.

613
00:22:35,488 --> 00:22:38,255
The grits play into it.

614
00:22:38,257 --> 00:22:42,059
Good Mexican-Texan-
   Southern combo

615
00:22:42,061 --> 00:22:43,327
with a twist, elevated.

616
00:22:43,329 --> 00:22:45,029
Real easy to explain.

617
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:46,797
- Chef, great energy, great food.
  -Appreciate that.

618
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:47,965
- Nice job.
  -Thank you very much.

619
00:22:47,967 --> 00:22:50,034
Wow! At a ski resort.

620
00:22:51,738 --> 00:22:53,437
Pork osso buco.

621
00:22:53,439 --> 00:22:55,172
It absolutely melts
 in your mouth.

622
00:22:55,174 --> 00:22:56,774
It's really, really good.

623
00:22:56,776 --> 00:23:00,044
And it's a cozy, wonderful
 atmosphere in here.

624
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:02,113
Which fits right in
   with the food.

625
00:23:02,115 --> 00:23:03,381
I like the
 mushroom stroganoff

626
00:23:03,383 --> 00:23:04,915
if I'm really hungry
after a day of skiing.

627
00:23:04,917 --> 00:23:07,918
A bunch of different mushrooms.
    It's delicious.

628
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,954
Okay so, we're gonna be
 making the spaetzle for the

629
00:23:09,956 --> 00:23:12,523
vegetarian mushroom stroganoff.
  -Love me some spaetzle.

630
00:23:12,525 --> 00:23:13,824
We'll start off with the flour.

631
00:23:13,826 --> 00:23:16,861
We'll sift it a bit.
 Create a little hole there.

632
00:23:16,863 --> 00:23:19,630
Toss in the eggs,
  a little warmed milk,

633
00:23:19,632 --> 00:23:20,865
little bit of water,
  and a little salt.

634
00:23:20,867 --> 00:23:22,433
I'm gonna start working it
   with my hands.

635
00:23:22,435 --> 00:23:24,034
Doesn't take
  very long at all.

636
00:23:24,036 --> 00:23:25,903
I've got a spaetzle
  maker over here.

637
00:23:28,341 --> 00:23:30,107
We're just gonna take it --

638
00:23:30,109 --> 00:23:31,542
gravity will eventually
   do it's job.

639
00:23:31,544 --> 00:23:33,744
So, you just slide it

640
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:35,212
into the boiling water
   back and forth.

641
00:23:35,214 --> 00:23:39,450
The sliding action will actually
 cut the dough as it goes in.

642
00:23:39,452 --> 00:23:40,885
A lot of people refer
  to spaetzle as pasta.

643
00:23:40,887 --> 00:23:43,187
It's actually
  more of a dumpling.

644
00:23:43,189 --> 00:23:45,456
Now, it needs to cook in here
 for just a couple minutes.

645
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:47,858
And we just put it
   in an ice bath.

646
00:23:49,162 --> 00:23:51,295
And then we sauté it
 at the time of service, yep.

647
00:23:51,297 --> 00:23:53,564
Got it.

648
00:23:53,566 --> 00:23:55,733
Fire up the pan.

649
00:23:55,735 --> 00:23:58,202
Little bit of oil,
 then I go ahead and dump in my

650
00:23:58,204 --> 00:23:59,503
sliced domestic mushrooms.

651
00:23:59,505 --> 00:24:00,738
- So, the buttons?
    -Yep.

652
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,773
The oysters.
  This is the shiitakes.

653
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:05,276
- Okay.
 -A little salt and pepper.

654
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:06,610
All right, and then
   I just stir it.

655
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:08,879
This'll get cooked down
 for about 25 minutes or so.

656
00:24:08,881 --> 00:24:10,214
So, now we're gonna
  assemble the dishes.

657
00:24:10,216 --> 00:24:11,382
So, we're gonna get
 a little oil in the pan,

658
00:24:11,384 --> 00:24:13,217
a little bit of red onion.
  -Got your garlic.

659
00:24:13,219 --> 00:24:15,820
Mushrooms.

660
00:24:15,822 --> 00:24:18,456
Little toss.

661
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:20,157
Let those cook
  just a moment or two.

662
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,327
One of the keys to this
 is the roasted-vegetable stock.

663
00:24:23,329 --> 00:24:24,762
Add a little bit of sour cream
  right off the bat,

664
00:24:24,764 --> 00:24:26,730
sort of swirl that in.

665
00:24:26,732 --> 00:24:30,367
That's where you kind of get
 that classic stroganoff flavor.

666
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:34,905
Chive, salt, pepper.

667
00:24:34,907 --> 00:24:36,373
And now, we're gonna go
  for the reduction.

668
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:38,909
We're gonna be
  plating the spaetzle.

669
00:24:38,911 --> 00:24:41,145
Next is the mushroom,

670
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:43,214
with just a touch
  more sour cream,

671
00:24:43,216 --> 00:24:44,615
and then a little bit of chive.
   There you go,

672
00:24:44,617 --> 00:24:47,351
and that is the vegetarian
  mushroom stroganoff.

673
00:24:47,353 --> 00:24:49,987
Boom boom boom boom,
     mushroom!

674
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:51,088
Little mix.

675
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:55,226
I can't say it's good.

676
00:24:55,228 --> 00:24:57,061
I can say
  it's great, though.

677
00:24:57,063 --> 00:24:59,897
The type of mushrooms,
 the way you cook 'em down

678
00:24:59,899 --> 00:25:01,298
but leave them
  with integrity --

679
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,133
I think that the mushrooms
 are still tender enough.

680
00:25:03,135 --> 00:25:06,103
You brought -- they brought
  out tons of flavor.

681
00:25:06,105 --> 00:25:08,339
I think that stock plays
  a huge role in it.

682
00:25:08,341 --> 00:25:10,474
It's hearty, it's comforting.

683
00:25:10,476 --> 00:25:12,643
Outrageous. You're a gangster.
  -Thank you, sir.

684
00:25:14,747 --> 00:25:16,514
Tastes like you're
   in Germany somewhere,

685
00:25:16,516 --> 00:25:18,449
and it's perfect when you
  come right off the slopes.

686
00:25:18,451 --> 00:25:19,750
I was gonna leave,

687
00:25:19,752 --> 00:25:21,452
but between the slopes,
   the snow,

688
00:25:21,454 --> 00:25:24,288
and the dude that made
the awesome mushroom stroganoff,

689
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:25,856
I gotta stick around.
  You got another dish?

690
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:27,157
I have a crispy
  pork belly.

691
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:28,592
- All right, bring it.
 -First thing I'm gonna do is

692
00:25:28,594 --> 00:25:31,295
I'm gonna score the meat.

693
00:25:31,297 --> 00:25:33,864
Next thing I'm gonna do
 is smear molasses on it.

694
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:37,935
Black tar, Texas tea.

695
00:25:37,937 --> 00:25:39,803
Next, I'm gonna season it.
  -And just one side --

696
00:25:39,805 --> 00:25:40,804
just the fat side?
    -Yeah.

697
00:25:40,806 --> 00:25:42,039
- Okay.
  -Just salt and pepper,

698
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:43,874
real liberal on this one.

699
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:45,242
You just throw it on the pan,

700
00:25:45,244 --> 00:25:46,844
and we're gonna toss it
  in the pizza oven

701
00:25:46,846 --> 00:25:49,213
for about seven
  or eight minutes.

702
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:50,648
Just put a little
    roast on it,

703
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:52,249
a little bit
    of crunch on it,

704
00:25:52,251 --> 00:25:53,651
and now, we're gonna braise it.
    -Right.

705
00:25:53,653 --> 00:25:56,754
So, I start off
 with maple syrup in the pan.

706
00:25:56,756 --> 00:25:59,290
I'll just place this right
  on top of that syrup.

707
00:25:59,292 --> 00:26:00,991
Now, you take the
  cinnamon-amon-amon-amon?

708
00:26:00,993 --> 00:26:02,726
- Just throw it on top.
 -And your water, Doctor.

709
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:03,827
Yep.

710
00:26:06,532 --> 00:26:08,299
Three hours,
  plastic or foil.

711
00:26:08,301 --> 00:26:09,733
Plastic really
     locks down,

712
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:11,368
and you actually
   build steam in this.

713
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:13,504
If you poked it,
    it would pssh!

714
00:26:13,506 --> 00:26:16,874
Sheet of foil.

715
00:26:16,876 --> 00:26:18,909
And then after this is
 all covered and sealed up,

716
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:21,545
it'll go in the oven
 right around 560 degrees or so

717
00:26:21,547 --> 00:26:22,713
for about three hours.

718
00:26:22,715 --> 00:26:24,281
After that,
  we actually let it cool

719
00:26:24,283 --> 00:26:25,983
in it's braising<i> jus</i>
   overnight.

720
00:26:29,121 --> 00:26:32,222
- Then we'll cut it.
 -And then they'll get skewered.

721
00:26:32,224 --> 00:26:34,725
- And then what, fried?
    -Fried.

722
00:26:34,727 --> 00:26:37,027
So, this is the crispy
  pork belly appetizer.

723
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:39,363
So, you start off with your
  cooked beans and apple.

724
00:26:39,365 --> 00:26:40,664
Look at that!

725
00:26:40,666 --> 00:26:42,232
Okay, you think that's
    enough pork belly?

726
00:26:42,234 --> 00:26:43,801
You gave me half a pig.

727
00:26:43,803 --> 00:26:45,302
And then the last thing
  that we're gonna do --

728
00:26:45,304 --> 00:26:48,038
it's my own interpretation of
a Carolina-style barbecue sauce.

729
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,573
And then, finish off
  with a touch of green.

730
00:26:49,575 --> 00:26:51,175
That is the crispy pork belly.

731
00:26:51,177 --> 00:26:53,077
Listen, you say pork belly,
    I say thank you.

732
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:55,212
Look at that pork
    just falling apart.

733
00:26:58,117 --> 00:27:01,285
You get that molasses
    right off the bat.

734
00:27:01,287 --> 00:27:04,555
Carolina-style sauce.

735
00:27:04,557 --> 00:27:06,523
Man, that vinegar
    was right there.

736
00:27:06,525 --> 00:27:10,127
You got sweet and heat,
   on meat you can't beat.

737
00:27:12,498 --> 00:27:13,831
Crispy pork belly
     and taco.

738
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:16,467
Have you ever seen a place
 at the bottom of a ski run

739
00:27:16,469 --> 00:27:17,868
that has food like this?
    -No.

740
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:18,969
Yourself?

741
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:20,638
I rest my case, Your Honor.

742
00:27:24,176 --> 00:27:26,110
Up next...
  a 90-year-old diner

743
00:27:26,112 --> 00:27:27,511
in Kenosha, Wisconsin...

744
00:27:27,513 --> 00:27:28,646
Out of my way,
  that way.

745
00:27:28,648 --> 00:27:30,214
...where the morning
   Garbage Plate.

746
00:27:30,216 --> 00:27:31,849
It's really good!

747
00:27:31,851 --> 00:27:33,183
...is bringing in the masses.

748
00:27:33,185 --> 00:27:36,186
Wow, there's a lot of people
  in a little place.

749
00:27:40,226 --> 00:27:43,560
I'm here in Kenosha, Wisconsin,
 about an hour north of Chicago

750
00:27:43,562 --> 00:27:45,829
and just a few blocks
  off of Lake Michigan,

751
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:48,198
at a place where
  their breakfast special

752
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,933
is called the Garbage Plate.

753
00:27:49,935 --> 00:27:52,336
All right, full plate,
 three meats.

754
00:27:52,338 --> 00:27:53,437
Someone's hungry today.

755
00:27:53,439 --> 00:27:55,305
How much will you be
  able to put down?

756
00:27:55,307 --> 00:27:57,775
I'll try for half, but the
dogs will get the rest.

757
00:27:57,777 --> 00:27:59,076
Have you ever seen
  anybody eat a full one?

758
00:27:59,078 --> 00:28:00,778
- No.
- This is a half.

759
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:01,945
He had the full.

760
00:28:01,947 --> 00:28:03,414
They're goin'
  for the garbage here,

761
00:28:03,416 --> 00:28:05,582
and a ton of other
  homemade favorites.

762
00:28:05,584 --> 00:28:07,184
All I need is a sausage!

763
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:08,886
- Like nonstop omelettes,
   -Cheddar.

764
00:28:08,888 --> 00:28:11,822
fluffy scrambles
 with a huge slab of ham,

765
00:28:11,824 --> 00:28:14,625
and French toast made
  from fresh baked bread.

766
00:28:14,627 --> 00:28:15,926
At Franks Diner...

767
00:28:15,928 --> 00:28:18,429
Wow, there's a lot of people
 in a little place.

768
00:28:18,431 --> 00:28:19,730
where they've been
  packin' them in...

769
00:28:19,732 --> 00:28:21,865
One piece of American
for my scram, please.

770
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:23,901
...just about forever.
- This is the best place in town.

771
00:28:23,903 --> 00:28:26,403
- Everybody knows you.
 -Out of my way, that way.

772
00:28:26,405 --> 00:28:29,139
The diner's been here
   since 1926,

773
00:28:29,141 --> 00:28:32,176
when it was pulled to the site
  by a team of horses.

774
00:28:32,178 --> 00:28:33,644
Owner Anthony Franks's kids

775
00:28:33,646 --> 00:28:35,512
have been telling
  the story for years.

776
00:28:35,514 --> 00:28:37,881
It was quite a big event
when it came into town.

777
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:39,516
The street was full
  of people

778
00:28:39,518 --> 00:28:43,153
waiting for this strange car
 to come to Kenosha.

779
00:28:43,155 --> 00:28:46,390
And over the decades, this place
 has become a local landmark.

780
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:47,791
It's kind of
    a family tradition.

781
00:28:47,793 --> 00:28:49,326
My grandparents
   used to hang out here,

782
00:28:49,328 --> 00:28:51,895
my parents hang out here,
  and now I hang out here.

783
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:54,531
Six years ago, when the
  family decided to sell,

784
00:28:54,533 --> 00:28:57,634
a couple of surprise buyers with
 no experience in the food biz

785
00:28:57,636 --> 00:29:00,070
Tomato, Lynnie.

786
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:02,072
Chris Schwartz
  and Lynn Groleau.

787
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:04,508
And this, I think,
   says "Franks?"

788
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:07,478
- It says "Franks."
 -Why did you keep the name?

789
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,012
- That's part of history.
   -That's it?

790
00:29:09,014 --> 00:29:10,547
- Oh, yeah, bottom line.
  -Did you come here

791
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:13,016
before you bought it?
 -Oh, yeah. We were regulars.

792
00:29:13,018 --> 00:29:13,984
And then you heard
  it was for sale,

793
00:29:13,986 --> 00:29:15,419
and you said?
   -"All right.

794
00:29:15,421 --> 00:29:17,254
- We'll go look at it."
- "Let's go look."

795
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:19,523
And, after
 a couple bottles of wine

796
00:29:19,525 --> 00:29:22,659
and taking a look at the place.

797
00:29:22,661 --> 00:29:24,128
Couple bottles of wine.
   -There you go.

798
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,229
- You believe that story?
 -Yeah, that's nice to do

799
00:29:25,231 --> 00:29:27,531
at 7:00 AM.
     I like it.

800
00:29:27,533 --> 00:29:29,867
If my dad were around,
 he'd be so proud of them.

801
00:29:29,869 --> 00:29:31,635
Schwartz's a master
    on the grill.

802
00:29:31,637 --> 00:29:35,405
Yes, yes. Looks like she's been
 cooking for 40 years this way.

803
00:29:35,407 --> 00:29:36,573
Woman or not, she's --

804
00:29:36,575 --> 00:29:37,841
Hey, are you saying
 I'm 40 years old?

805
00:29:37,843 --> 00:29:39,042
No, I'm just saying you
  were born at the grill.

806
00:29:39,044 --> 00:29:42,346
You look like a seasoned line
  cook of 30 years.

807
00:29:42,348 --> 00:29:44,915
Putting out dozens
 of homecooked orders at time.

808
00:29:44,917 --> 00:29:46,183
Honey on one!

809
00:29:46,185 --> 00:29:47,818
Like pancakes with
   peanut butter

810
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,019
<i> and</i> jelly,

811
00:29:49,021 --> 00:29:51,555
cinnamon-roll French toast,

812
00:29:51,557 --> 00:29:54,358
a Reuben omelette with
 Thousand Island dressing,

813
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,827
and the famous Garbage Plate.
  You think you can

814
00:29:56,829 --> 00:29:57,995
put that all down?
    -Yeah.

815
00:29:57,997 --> 00:29:59,396
A hunk of hash browns

816
00:29:59,398 --> 00:30:01,698
with whatever's in the kitchen,
  scrambled up with eggs.

817
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,700
So, Garbage Plate's
 the number-1 heavy hitter.

818
00:30:03,702 --> 00:30:04,968
Garbage Plate's
number-1 heavy hitter.

819
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,837
- Unquestionably, that's it?
  -Make more of those

820
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:08,038
than anything in a day.

821
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,607
So, every Garbage Plate
  starts the same way?

822
00:30:10,609 --> 00:30:12,709
- Every day.
  -Onions, the green

823
00:30:12,711 --> 00:30:13,911
- Onions.
 -bell peppers, the jalapeño.

824
00:30:13,913 --> 00:30:16,113
- Yep, chorizo.
 -Chorizo! That's interesting.

825
00:30:16,115 --> 00:30:19,883
I mean, I'm in California,
 and we have a lot of chorizo.

826
00:30:19,885 --> 00:30:22,686
Is chorizo big up here in --

827
00:30:22,688 --> 00:30:23,987
- I mean...
  -I mean, in Kenosha?

828
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:26,790
Right by the water.
  -It can be, it can be.

829
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:29,126
These are all
 my Garbage Plates.

830
00:30:29,128 --> 00:30:31,395
Of course, no one can
order them the same way,

831
00:30:31,397 --> 00:30:33,664
so that's why
 I have 18 of them

832
00:30:33,666 --> 00:30:35,332
on the grill,
 all different.

833
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:37,801
But we are here
 to accommodate,

834
00:30:37,803 --> 00:30:39,236
and to please.

835
00:30:39,238 --> 00:30:40,904
Someone can really eat that
 whole thing, or is that like

836
00:30:40,906 --> 00:30:41,939
a family gets those?
  Like a family of 10?

837
00:30:41,941 --> 00:30:44,608
There's this one guy
    way on the end.

838
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:45,742
- This is yours?
   -That's mine.

839
00:30:45,744 --> 00:30:46,877
- Two meat?
    -Yes.

840
00:30:46,879 --> 00:30:47,945
- Garbage Plate?
   -Absolutely.

841
00:30:47,947 --> 00:30:49,646
- Have you had this before?
   -I have.

842
00:30:49,648 --> 00:30:51,515
- Can you eat this whole thing?
    -No.

843
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:53,750
You have already
  subdivided yours.

844
00:30:53,752 --> 00:30:54,985
This is true.
   I'm working this way.

845
00:30:54,987 --> 00:30:56,620
It has all the meat.
 It's really good.

846
00:30:56,622 --> 00:30:58,288
You know what?
   It really is!

847
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:00,123
And usually,
  I don't even like eggs.

848
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:02,426
I know, this is the most eggs
 you've ever seen me eat.

849
00:31:02,428 --> 00:31:03,727
I don't even wanna hear
  anything about it.

850
00:31:03,729 --> 00:31:06,763
--It's really good!

851
00:31:06,765 --> 00:31:08,298
I mean, it's regular
  breakfast stuff,

852
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,833
but there's something about it.

853
00:31:09,835 --> 00:31:11,034
I think, the chorizo.

854
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:12,603
Hoo-whee!

855
00:31:12,605 --> 00:31:14,538
Now, you don't<i> have</i> to go
  for the garbage.

856
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,607
Lots of folks come here
  for the omelettes

857
00:31:16,609 --> 00:31:18,442
or the huge French toast.

858
00:31:18,444 --> 00:31:19,776
This is all for you?!

859
00:31:19,778 --> 00:31:21,245
I thought I'd share some
  Oh, my goodness!

860
00:31:21,247 --> 00:31:22,846
with a friend
 in the back dining room.

861
00:31:22,848 --> 00:31:25,115
Are you gonna share with me?
    -No.

862
00:31:25,117 --> 00:31:27,584
- No? That was no?

863
00:31:27,586 --> 00:31:28,819
Can't blame her.

864
00:31:28,821 --> 00:31:30,854
The French toast comes
  from homemade bread.

865
00:31:30,856 --> 00:31:32,656
You'd never expect this
  from a breakfast joint.

866
00:31:32,658 --> 00:31:34,358
We really wanted
  to stay with the tradition

867
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,226
of old diner,
   everything homemade,

868
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:37,394
everything made to order,

869
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:39,396
and homemade bread
    is part of that.

870
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:41,331
They scratch-bake
  everything here.

871
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:43,367
We hand me the bread.
  I had the most arm power,

872
00:31:43,369 --> 00:31:44,635
so I got stuck
     doing it.

873
00:31:44,637 --> 00:31:47,604
Lemme see those heaters.
   Huh? Look!

874
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:50,908
- Okay, we're not arm wrestling.
   -All right.

875
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:52,609
Do you know how to braid?
    He's got it.

876
00:31:52,611 --> 00:31:53,944
No, I just wanted to redo it.

877
00:31:53,946 --> 00:31:55,445
Make it pretty?
     Yeah.

878
00:31:55,447 --> 00:31:57,214
We're gonna serve this.
 I don't want you to say,

879
00:31:57,216 --> 00:31:59,816
"Oh hey, Marge, Lloyd,
  hey, how ya' doing?

880
00:31:59,818 --> 00:32:02,686
Yeah, Guy from the Food Network
  made that jerky one."

881
00:32:04,156 --> 00:32:07,691
Now that -- that's good,
    for a first try.

882
00:32:07,693 --> 00:32:09,326
- Hmm?
 -Hoh-hoh. I'm impressed.

883
00:32:09,328 --> 00:32:11,461
And as long as we're
 in the back room, baking,

884
00:32:11,463 --> 00:32:14,331
get a load of this.
  -These are the pasties.

885
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:16,600
Now, where did you learn
  to make pasties?

886
00:32:16,602 --> 00:32:20,270
This is a grandmother
   and a mother thing, so.

887
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:22,839
Are pasties big here in

888
00:32:22,841 --> 00:32:24,408
lower Wisconsin, upper Illinois?
   -A little bit,

889
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:26,810
because a lot of people
     have come

890
00:32:26,812 --> 00:32:29,179
from upper Michigan, and
 that's where these come from.

891
00:32:29,181 --> 00:32:31,548
It's kind of a Midwest empanada.

892
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:33,550
Thin as you can
    possibly get it.

893
00:32:33,552 --> 00:32:36,186
Stuffed with beef
 and all<i> kinds</i> of vegetables.

894
00:32:36,188 --> 00:32:38,155
Put her in the dough,
  make your little half-moon,

895
00:32:38,157 --> 00:32:41,258
and you're done.
  -That is<i> really</i> good.

896
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,626
I could eat
  another six of those.

897
00:32:42,628 --> 00:32:44,895
- It's awesome.
  -I'm seeing the light.

898
00:32:44,897 --> 00:32:47,931
- Mmm.

899
00:32:47,933 --> 00:32:50,634
- Steak and tots.
 -But as killer as the food is,

900
00:32:50,636 --> 00:32:52,569
- Hi, Andy!
  -the feel of the place

901
00:32:52,571 --> 00:32:53,904
is as big an attraction.

902
00:32:53,906 --> 00:32:57,674
"Order what you want,
  eat what you get!"

903
00:32:57,676 --> 00:32:59,676
I like that.
   -You like that?

904
00:32:59,678 --> 00:33:02,779
- Can I get a cup of coffee?
  -Go get it yourself.

905
00:33:06,185 --> 00:33:08,218
Does that mean --
 just because you like me,

906
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,319
or does everybody
  get treated that way?

907
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:10,687
- Everybody does that.
   -Seriously?

908
00:33:10,689 --> 00:33:12,055
And if you're gonna
    do your own refill,

909
00:33:12,057 --> 00:33:13,724
you're gonna refill
    the entire diner,

910
00:33:13,726 --> 00:33:14,858
not just you.

911
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,526
- No.
   -Uh, yeah.

912
00:33:16,528 --> 00:33:17,561
You just pick it up and go?

913
00:33:17,563 --> 00:33:19,629
You have to.
You don't have a choice.

914
00:33:19,631 --> 00:33:21,131
Half a cup?

915
00:33:21,133 --> 00:33:23,100
No, put it all
     in there.

916
00:33:23,102 --> 00:33:25,302
Any real rhyme
  of who goes where?

917
00:33:25,304 --> 00:33:26,570
Do you have like
  sections, or...?

918
00:33:26,572 --> 00:33:29,439
- It's organized chaos, yeah.
    -Okay.

919
00:33:29,441 --> 00:33:31,541
- Work okay?
  -Want some more coffee?

920
00:33:31,543 --> 00:33:33,043
- Yeah.
 -Okay, go get it yourself.

921
00:33:34,847 --> 00:33:37,280
This is one of those places
where everybody knows your name.

922
00:33:37,282 --> 00:33:39,082
And has for eight decades.

923
00:33:39,084 --> 00:33:41,551
We do our best, since
  it's 81 years old, okay?

924
00:33:41,553 --> 00:33:43,086
Which makes Franks the oldest

925
00:33:43,088 --> 00:33:46,423
continuously operating
 lunch-cart diner in the U.S.,

926
00:33:46,425 --> 00:33:48,625
Oh, yeah.
  preserving a tradition:

927
00:33:48,627 --> 00:33:51,695
great food and great times.

928
00:33:51,697 --> 00:33:55,365
To have something like this
is kind of a treasure.

929
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:56,833
You work six days a week?

930
00:33:56,835 --> 00:33:58,602
- Pretty much, yeah.
  -Right like this?

931
00:33:58,604 --> 00:34:00,070
- Right like this. I'm on this.
  -Lot of people --

932
00:34:00,072 --> 00:34:02,039
She does the back kitchen, I do
the front kitchen, six days.

933
00:34:02,041 --> 00:34:03,340
I mean, is it
  a little strange

934
00:34:03,342 --> 00:34:06,576
that a lot of people
 in Kenosha know your backside?

935
00:34:06,578 --> 00:34:08,211
People wanna advertise
 back there, though.

936
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:10,414
- Yeah, I'm telling ya'!
  -Sell some space here.

937
00:34:10,416 --> 00:34:14,184
I'm thinking about, lemme get
 "Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives."

938
00:34:14,186 --> 00:34:16,153
Comin' up...
 in Salem, Massachusetts...

939
00:34:16,155 --> 00:34:17,254
Get funky with it!

940
00:34:17,256 --> 00:34:19,756
...a seafood spot
  tackling tasty turf...

941
00:34:19,758 --> 00:34:20,957
That's totally legit.

942
00:34:20,959 --> 00:34:23,593
...and a lobster with
  a straight-up twist.

943
00:34:23,595 --> 00:34:25,495
The whole reason
I rolled into this joint

944
00:34:25,497 --> 00:34:27,964
was I heard about
this lobster martini.

945
00:34:32,871 --> 00:34:34,538
I'm about 30 minutes
  north of Boston,

946
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:37,641
in the famous town
 of Salem, Massachusetts.

947
00:34:37,643 --> 00:34:39,409
You know, the witch trials
   and everything?

948
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:41,344
Well, right now I'm in
  the historic area

949
00:34:41,346 --> 00:34:43,947
known as Artists' Row,
  and what caught my ear

950
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:45,282
is I hear
  there's a little joint

951
00:34:45,284 --> 00:34:48,018
that's makin' a<i> wicked</i>
  lobster martini.

952
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:50,120
This is the Lobster Shanty.

953
00:34:50,122 --> 00:34:52,722
- Two Lobstertinis.
    -Enjoy.

954
00:34:52,724 --> 00:34:55,125
It's like a dirty martini,
  but not as salty.

955
00:34:55,127 --> 00:34:56,293
Lobster claws!

956
00:34:56,295 --> 00:34:57,861
- I'm a little wary.

957
00:34:57,863 --> 00:34:59,096
But I will try it.

958
00:34:59,098 --> 00:35:00,630
Later, after the food.

959
00:35:00,632 --> 00:35:02,799
- Lobster roll.
  -The best I've had
   in New England.

960
00:35:02,801 --> 00:35:04,801
- Steamers!
- Everything you'd expect

961
00:35:04,803 --> 00:35:06,203
in a New England
   seafood shack.

962
00:35:06,205 --> 00:35:08,371
- Clam basket.
 -And some things you wouldn't.

963
00:35:08,373 --> 00:35:09,806
Margherita pizza.

964
00:35:09,808 --> 00:35:10,507
Mac 'n' cheese!

965
00:35:10,509 --> 00:35:11,842
Oh, so good.

966
00:35:11,844 --> 00:35:13,643
- They're serving comfort food.
   -Goin' in.

967
00:35:13,645 --> 00:35:15,078
Ever since Diane Wolf --
    -Yeah.

968
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,013
- her friends call her Dee Dee --
   -Oven's open!

969
00:35:17,015 --> 00:35:18,915
bought the joint three
  and a half years ago.

970
00:35:18,917 --> 00:35:20,851
- Got it.
 -How did you find the location?

971
00:35:20,853 --> 00:35:22,586
We were actually
   regulars here.

972
00:35:22,588 --> 00:35:24,254
Dee Dee is actually
    a trained chef.

973
00:35:24,256 --> 00:35:26,289
You're getting really
    wonderful recipes.

974
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:28,492
Like this non-New England
   speciality.

975
00:35:28,494 --> 00:35:29,960
- Pulled-pork sandwich!
  -This is the bomb.

976
00:35:29,962 --> 00:35:31,495
I mean, it's awesome.

977
00:35:31,497 --> 00:35:33,096
Very nice
    barbecue flavor.

978
00:35:33,098 --> 00:35:34,965
Smoking chips?
 What do we got?

979
00:35:34,967 --> 00:35:36,700
Two parts hickory,
  one part mesquite.

980
00:35:36,702 --> 00:35:39,536
Soak these in coffee and beer.
   -Really?!

981
00:35:39,538 --> 00:35:40,971
And I'll let this sit
   overnight

982
00:35:40,973 --> 00:35:42,606
and let the wood chips
  get nice and soft.

983
00:35:42,608 --> 00:35:44,774
Take that liquid out, put the
 wood chips in the smoker,

984
00:35:44,776 --> 00:35:46,276
add some humidity
  inside the smoker,

985
00:35:46,278 --> 00:35:47,711
add the flavor,
  -She doesn't stop!

986
00:35:47,713 --> 00:35:48,945
keep the meat
  from drying out.

987
00:35:48,947 --> 00:35:50,247
So now, we're gonna
  make some salt mix.

988
00:35:50,249 --> 00:35:52,916
Coarse ground black pepper,
  kosher salt, rosemary,

989
00:35:52,918 --> 00:35:55,452
sage, and parsley
  ground together.

990
00:35:55,454 --> 00:35:57,220
Okay. And then, we're
gonna smoke some meat.

991
00:35:57,222 --> 00:35:58,355
Boneless pork butt.

992
00:35:58,357 --> 00:35:59,689
Start with making
   some pork rub.

993
00:35:59,691 --> 00:36:02,058
Steak seasoning, brown sugar.
 -Some of your super-salt.

994
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:04,327
Red pepper flakes, cumin.
  <i> -Cumino.</i> Cayenne.

995
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:05,862
Love the smoked
  Hungarian paprika,

996
00:36:05,864 --> 00:36:07,097
mild chili powder.

997
00:36:07,099 --> 00:36:09,566
Get that lid on there,
and get funky with it!

998
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:13,904
- Nice.
  -Grab the spices out
   with one hand,

999
00:36:13,906 --> 00:36:14,971
- Mm-hmm.
 -rub it on with the other hand,

1000
00:36:14,973 --> 00:36:17,174
so you don't put
the pork hand back in

1001
00:36:17,176 --> 00:36:18,475
to contaminate.
 -Oh, yeah. Put 'em right into

1002
00:36:18,477 --> 00:36:20,076
the smoker, 13 hours.

1003
00:36:20,078 --> 00:36:22,145
Ah! Like we're
   making a witch's brew.

1004
00:36:22,147 --> 00:36:23,513
We gotta be doing
    barbecue sauce.

1005
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:25,248
We absolutely are.
  A little garlic oil,

1006
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:26,917
our magical salt mix,
   diced onions,

1007
00:36:26,919 --> 00:36:28,151
just a little bit of garlic.

1008
00:36:28,153 --> 00:36:30,353
That's my style.

1009
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:33,356
Brown sugar.
 Now that that is caramelized.

1010
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:34,457
Boatload of ketchup.

1011
00:36:34,459 --> 00:36:35,825
- Throw in.
   -Molasses.

1012
00:36:35,827 --> 00:36:37,994
Worcestershire sauce,
  rice-wine vinegar.

1013
00:36:37,996 --> 00:36:39,129
Interesting.

1014
00:36:39,131 --> 00:36:40,397
Orange juice,
  pineapple juice.

1015
00:36:40,399 --> 00:36:42,732
Chopped tomatoes right now.
  Chili-garlic paste.

1016
00:36:42,734 --> 00:36:45,068
Cayenne pepper,
 smoked paprika, cinnamon,

1017
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:46,603
red pepper flakes,
   chili powder,

1018
00:36:46,605 --> 00:36:47,571
cumin,
   <i> -Cumino.</i>

1019
00:36:47,573 --> 00:36:48,505
and the deadly

1020
00:36:48,507 --> 00:36:50,006
- Hang on.
  -ghost chili pepper.

1021
00:36:50,008 --> 00:36:51,908
Whoa!

1022
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:53,877
- They're really hot.
   -See my eyes?

1023
00:36:53,879 --> 00:36:55,078
In they go.
   Ghost chilies.

1024
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,346
Cook this for probably
   about an hour.

1025
00:36:56,348 --> 00:36:57,981
Little immersion
    blender into that.

1026
00:36:57,983 --> 00:36:59,983
- And make it smooth.
 -Lemme taste the wicked brew.

1027
00:36:59,985 --> 00:37:01,318
Is it ready?

1028
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,719
Mmm. Whoo!

1029
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:04,487
Ooh, a little kiss
   right there at the end!

1030
00:37:04,489 --> 00:37:05,689
Yeah, right.
 Now, we're gonna take these

1031
00:37:05,691 --> 00:37:07,657
pork butts out of the smoker.
   -Look at that!

1032
00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:09,326
You know it's done when you
can just grab a corner of it

1033
00:37:09,328 --> 00:37:11,394
like that and just
 shred it off.

1034
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:13,663
Mmm, wow!
Delicious, great rub.

1035
00:37:13,665 --> 00:37:14,798
- Pull it apart.
    -Right.

1036
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,999
We're gonna
sauce 'em in the bowl.

1037
00:37:16,001 --> 00:37:17,867
Get it on!
  -Stir that around.

1038
00:37:17,869 --> 00:37:19,502
Let's make that sandwich,
     all right?

1039
00:37:19,504 --> 00:37:20,637
Lettuce and tomato.

1040
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:22,272
There you go.

1041
00:37:22,274 --> 00:37:25,208
Mmm. Whoa!
  That's totally legit.

1042
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:26,810
The pulled pork is delicious.

1043
00:37:26,812 --> 00:37:30,013
Crazy smoke with the beer
   and the coffee.

1044
00:37:30,015 --> 00:37:33,650
Tender, it's moist,
 but what really makes it --

1045
00:37:33,652 --> 00:37:36,219
you've got a really nice,
 sweet-heat barbecue sauce

1046
00:37:36,221 --> 00:37:39,456
going on that complements it
  incredibly well.

1047
00:37:39,458 --> 00:37:41,825
Mmm. Seriously, great job!
   -Rock on.

1048
00:37:41,827 --> 00:37:43,026
Pulled-pork sandwich.

1049
00:37:43,028 --> 00:37:44,995
Sweet, spicy, and salty.

1050
00:37:44,997 --> 00:37:46,296
- The best.
  -Enjoy your meals.

1051
00:37:46,298 --> 00:37:48,531
- I love it here.
 -You're in a little shack.

1052
00:37:48,533 --> 00:37:50,133
Big tourist area.
   -Mm-hmm.

1053
00:37:50,135 --> 00:37:52,168
You could just be serving
  corn beef sandwiches

1054
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:54,004
and lobster chowder,
  and be done with it.

1055
00:37:54,006 --> 00:37:55,238
Where's the love
     in that?

1056
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,607
You walk in, you get
    really great food.

1057
00:37:57,609 --> 00:37:59,943
Everything is
    freshly prepared.

1058
00:37:59,945 --> 00:38:01,645
- All righty.
 -That's why people come here.

1059
00:38:01,647 --> 00:38:04,781
For everything from clam chowder
  to fried mozzarella.

1060
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:06,349
- To die for.
   -Even beef.

1061
00:38:06,351 --> 00:38:07,450
When I'm at the
    Lobster Shanty,

1062
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:10,020
I do go
    for the steak tips.

1063
00:38:10,022 --> 00:38:11,388
Okay, so what are we
gonna start on first?

1064
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:12,856
I'm gonna trim the flap meat.

1065
00:38:12,858 --> 00:38:14,457
Now this is all trimmed off,
  I'm gonna cube it up.

1066
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:15,959
Big chunks like that?
 Now, the marinade.

1067
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:18,428
- Brown sugar and just a pinch.
 -Some of your supersalt.

1068
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:20,030
- Some Worcestershire sauce.
   -"Some"?

1069
00:38:20,032 --> 00:38:21,998
A little soy sauce.
 Okay, a lot of soy sauce.

1070
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,134
Some coarse black pepper,
   garlic cloves,

1071
00:38:24,136 --> 00:38:25,302
red pepper flakes.
    -Whoa!

1072
00:38:25,304 --> 00:38:26,403
Guinness.

1073
00:38:26,405 --> 00:38:27,904
Love that sound.
   -Nice sound.

1074
00:38:27,906 --> 00:38:29,072
- Yes.
  -I love that sound.

1075
00:38:29,074 --> 00:38:32,375
- It's the best sound.
 -Boatload of stout beer.

1076
00:38:32,377 --> 00:38:34,878
- Yes, but wait, there's more.
    -Okay.

1077
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,514
- And then, molasses.
 -What a wild concoction.

1078
00:38:37,516 --> 00:38:38,948
Pour the marinade
   over the meat.

1079
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:40,583
So, we let this go
for at least eight hours?

1080
00:38:40,585 --> 00:38:42,052
Grill's hot!
   Throw it on the grill.

1081
00:38:42,054 --> 00:38:43,753
Look how it's started
   to break down already

1082
00:38:43,755 --> 00:38:45,088
from the marinade --
     nice!

1083
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:46,589
We are ready.
  Let's plate these up.

1084
00:38:46,591 --> 00:38:49,292
All right. Looks good.
 Look at that.

1085
00:38:49,294 --> 00:38:50,827
Mmm!
 Really tasty.

1086
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:52,529
You get all the notes --
the soy at the beginning

1087
00:38:52,531 --> 00:38:54,798
and then the morasses,
 tiny bit of heat.

1088
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,766
The underlying theme
 has to be that stout beer.

1089
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:58,668
Don't just think that
we're a lobster shack.

1090
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,136
We make steak, too.
  Mmm!

1091
00:39:00,138 --> 00:39:01,304
Well done.
   -Excellent.

1092
00:39:01,306 --> 00:39:03,440
Steak tips are delicious,
    cut right apart.

1093
00:39:03,442 --> 00:39:05,108
- Enjoy.
  -It's just good food.

1094
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,609
It's not pretentious.

1095
00:39:06,611 --> 00:39:08,244
- Surf and turf!
- There's something for everyone.

1096
00:39:08,246 --> 00:39:10,680
We had the marinated flap meat
  done in the stout beer.

1097
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:11,815
Some real-deal barbecue.

1098
00:39:11,817 --> 00:39:13,683
But the whole reason
 I rolled into this joint

1099
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:15,919
was I heard about
  this lobster martini.

1100
00:39:15,921 --> 00:39:18,088
I love martinis.
    This is awesome.

1101
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:20,523
Something I've
  never had before.

1102
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:21,624
Two Lobstertinis!

1103
00:39:21,626 --> 00:39:23,059
You're the one that
invented this, right?

1104
00:39:23,061 --> 00:39:24,327
Yeah. Instead of vermouth,

1105
00:39:24,329 --> 00:39:25,862
lobster essence,
 and you put a claw on it.

1106
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:27,364
- And they like it?
  -Yeah, they like it.

1107
00:39:27,366 --> 00:39:28,898
It tastes like
   the ocean -- lovely.

1108
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,633
I wanted to get a drink
    and enjoy lobster,

1109
00:39:30,635 --> 00:39:33,236
so you have to go with this.
 -These are the lobsters.

1110
00:39:33,238 --> 00:39:35,572
We're gonna use the bodies
  to make the stock --

1111
00:39:35,574 --> 00:39:36,973
the essence
  for the Lobstertini.

1112
00:39:36,975 --> 00:39:38,742
Still a little
    funkified by this,

1113
00:39:38,744 --> 00:39:40,043
to be very honest
     with you.

1114
00:39:40,045 --> 00:39:41,945
I mean, I like -- I love
   making lobster bisque.

1115
00:39:41,947 --> 00:39:43,947
Same start,
  different finish.

1116
00:39:43,949 --> 00:39:45,849
Do you like dirty martinis?
  -I like dirty martinis.

1117
00:39:45,851 --> 00:39:47,550
Then, I think this is
  gonna be your segue.

1118
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:49,686
- This is gonna do it?
  -Like salty, briny,

1119
00:39:49,688 --> 00:39:51,121
delicious lobster flavor.
   -Lobstery?

1120
00:39:51,123 --> 00:39:52,722
It's also a snack.

1121
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:54,457
- All right.
  -You're gonna love it.

1122
00:39:54,459 --> 00:39:56,126
And of course, we threw some
  of our magical salt mix

1123
00:39:56,128 --> 00:39:57,527
in the water.
 -Of course we did, 'cause we

1124
00:39:57,529 --> 00:39:58,962
don't do anything without
   the magical salt mix.

1125
00:39:58,964 --> 00:40:00,096
- Nothing.
  -Let those go for about

1126
00:40:00,098 --> 00:40:01,297
10 to 15 minutes?
  -'Til they turn red.

1127
00:40:01,299 --> 00:40:02,999
Bring 'em out,
    let 'em cool down.

1128
00:40:03,001 --> 00:40:04,934
crack 'em,
    take the meat,

1129
00:40:04,936 --> 00:40:06,870
and begin the process
    of making the broth

1130
00:40:06,872 --> 00:40:08,338
with the lobster shell.
    -Yes.

1131
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:10,240
Cold water,
    we got the bodies

1132
00:40:10,242 --> 00:40:11,708
- Yep.
 -and all their goodness.

1133
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:13,910
Black peppercorns,
   onion, carrot,

1134
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:15,578
celery.
  -A little mirepoix.

1135
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,747
Fresh rosemary, fresh
   -BOTH: dill.

1136
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:19,482
And a little sage.
   -And sage.

1137
00:40:19,484 --> 00:40:20,884
Simmer this
    for five hours.

1138
00:40:20,886 --> 00:40:22,519
How are you gonna keep
  the murkiness of it out?

1139
00:40:22,521 --> 00:40:24,087
Strain it once through
  a regular chinois

1140
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:26,189
- Strainer.
 -then I'll run it again through

1141
00:40:26,191 --> 00:40:28,525
like a coffee filter to get
 all that sediment out of it.

1142
00:40:28,527 --> 00:40:30,460
So, this is just
   clear lobster broth.

1143
00:40:30,462 --> 00:40:32,128
Mm-hmm. Strain it
  into a squeeze bottle.

1144
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:33,830
And then, we're gonna
  make the lobster martini.

1145
00:40:33,832 --> 00:40:35,031
Oh,<i> we're</i> not going to.

1146
00:40:35,033 --> 00:40:37,934
I'm gonna hand you off
 to Sarah, my bar manager.

1147
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:39,936
- Do you want me to make it?
 -Oh, go for it. I mean --

1148
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:41,471
- Are you ready? Vodka.
   -Healthy pour.

1149
00:40:41,473 --> 00:40:42,272
Yulp.

1150
00:40:42,274 --> 00:40:43,473
- Yulp.

1151
00:40:43,475 --> 00:40:44,908
Lobster essence.

1152
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:47,644
A little bit more than you
 would do vermouth in a martini.

1153
00:40:47,646 --> 00:40:48,745
But it's not as strong.

1154
00:40:48,747 --> 00:40:49,846
Doesn't have
  a taste like vermouth.

1155
00:40:49,848 --> 00:40:50,880
Then you just shake it.

1156
00:40:50,882 --> 00:40:51,981
Anybody feel like
 I'm gonna be

1157
00:40:51,983 --> 00:40:55,952
having cold,
lobster-bisque cocktail?

1158
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:57,587
Chilled martini glass.

1159
00:40:57,589 --> 00:41:00,390
Strain it, lobster claw,
  the lemon twist --

1160
00:41:00,392 --> 00:41:03,092
there's your Lobstertini.
  -Let me prepare myself.

1161
00:41:03,094 --> 00:41:04,928
Is there a way to do
 this in particular?

1162
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:06,329
Some people put
 the lobster in the glass.

1163
00:41:06,331 --> 00:41:07,997
Some people just
   eat the lobster

1164
00:41:07,999 --> 00:41:10,500
and they finish it
 with a sip of the martini.

1165
00:41:10,502 --> 00:41:12,902
- Mm-hmm.
 -Which is what I prefer to do.

1166
00:41:12,904 --> 00:41:15,572
When in Rome.

1167
00:41:15,574 --> 00:41:17,140
Mmm!
Great lobster flavor.

1168
00:41:17,142 --> 00:41:19,609
This is almost like the
ghost-of-lobster martini.

1169
00:41:19,611 --> 00:41:20,777
- Yeah.
 -You don't get the lobster;

1170
00:41:20,779 --> 00:41:21,978
you just get the flavor.
   -Exactly.

1171
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,112
You just get
 the hint of it.

1172
00:41:23,114 --> 00:41:25,114
I understand why you serve
 the claw with it,

1173
00:41:25,116 --> 00:41:26,483
but you know what?
 I think the people

1174
00:41:26,485 --> 00:41:28,384
that really like martinis
 and like 'em dirty,

1175
00:41:28,386 --> 00:41:30,887
that's gotta -- it's
absolutely lobster martini.

1176
00:41:30,889 --> 00:41:32,722
It's fresh and it's got
    some lemon in it.

1177
00:41:32,724 --> 00:41:34,357
It's good.
 -I'd definitely have it again.

1178
00:41:34,359 --> 00:41:35,959
You never see it anywhere else.
    -Enjoy.

1179
00:41:35,961 --> 00:41:37,594
It's a cool place
     to come to.

1180
00:41:37,596 --> 00:41:39,762
- The lobster mac 'n' cheese.
 -And the food is fabulous.

1181
00:41:39,764 --> 00:41:41,865
So, that's it from the
   Lobster Shanty

1182
00:41:41,867 --> 00:41:43,900
in Salem, Massachusetts.

1183
00:41:43,902 --> 00:41:46,369
A lobster cocktail.
  I've always told ya:

1184
00:41:46,371 --> 00:41:48,304
If it's funky, we'll find it.

1185
00:41:48,306 --> 00:41:51,241
See ya' next time, on
 "Diners, Drive-Ins, & Dives."

1186
00:41:51,243 --> 00:41:53,109
What is that?!

1187
00:41:53,111 --> 00:41:55,078
What is that type
    of ridiculousness?

1188
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,779
Does this go on
    all the time?

1189
00:41:58,917 --> 00:42:00,283
That's awesome!

          HOW TO MAKE BISCUITS?

373
00:14:33,173 --> 00:14:35,440
  WHEN I WAS 12 YEARS OLD,
I WENT TO A BOARDING SCHOOL.

374

WE ALL HAD TO DO A TASK.

375
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,711
  AND MINE WAS TO MAKE BISCUITS
      FOR THE WHOLE SCHOOL.

376
00:14:39,813 --> 00:14:41,613

   EVERY, EVERY MORNING.

               OH, SO YOU'RE
           A BISCUIT QUEEN THEN?
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
   ABOUT THAT.

378
00:14:44,284 --> 00:14:47,285
THIS IS SELF-RISING FLOUR. IT
ALREADY HAS OUR BAKING POWDER.

379
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:49,354
   THIS IS SHORTENING.
AND YOU WORK ALL THIS IN.

380
00:14:49,456 --> 00:14:51,623
           YOU TRY TO GET THOSE
            GRANULES. HOW MUCH?

381
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:53,591
   JUST POUR SLOWLY,
AND I'LL LET YOU KNOW.

382
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:56,327

                  EVERYWHERE?
YES.

384

     TO YOUR NOSE TO YOUR ELBOW,

385
00:15:01,201 --> 00:15:02,800
                 YOU GOT ISSUES?
EVIDENTLY.

OKAY, GRAVY.

387
00:15:05,972 --> 00:15:09,173
                    AND LET'S
                 GET SOME FLOUR.
 WE'RE GONNA START
THICKENING THIS UP.

388
00:15:09,276 --> 00:15:11,276

A LITTLE ROUX HERE.

  A BIT ON THE BOTTOM.

390
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,213
            OKAY, TURN IT DOWN

  I'M LIKE A PRO-BOWL CHAMPION.

394

     THOSE ARE SOME THICK UN'S.

396
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:32,330
       AND YOU SPOON ON A LITTLE
           CLARIFIED BUTTER.
THIS IS SHORTENING.

397
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,332
          WHOO, THAT'S A NEW WAY
               FOR BISCUITS.

398
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:36,768
      I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT MUCH
    SHORTENING GO ON. I LIKE IT.

399
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,937
HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE
THE BISCUITS TO COOK?

400
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:41,806
              ABOUT TEN MINUTES.
SAUSAGE GOES DOWN
   INTO THAT.

401
00:15:41,908 --> 00:15:44,909
      IF YOU PUT THE SAUSAGE IN
    RIGHT AWAY, IT GETS TOO HOT.

402
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:47,612
      KEEP GOING UNTIL I HOLLER.
              OKAY, STOP.

403
00:15:47,714 --> 00:15:49,647
HOLLER THEN.
                            AAH.

404
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:52,383

   THE RIGHT RATIO?

407
00:15:57,824 --> 00:16:00,124

NO, I'M ALWAYS HUNGRY.

           WARM IN THE WINTER.

410

       LOOK AT THAT. WHAT A PRO.

479
00:18:41,988 --> 00:18:44,789
                  LOOK HOW NICE
                  IT TURNED OUT.
OKAY, THEN WE'RE
 GONNA DO THIS.

480
00:18:44,891 --> 00:18:46,657
             POKING A LITTLE BIT
              OF HOLES IN IT--

481
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:48,526
               LET'S IT BREATHE
               SOME OF THE STEAM

482
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,461
        SO IT DOESN'T BUBBLE UP.
EXACTLY.

483
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:52,864
             AND THAT'LL GO DOWN
                  FOR WHAT?
15 TO 20.

484
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:54,832
               WE'RE GONNA MAKE
              THE COCONUT CREAM?
YEAH.

485
00:18:54,934 --> 00:18:56,834
                    CORN STARCH.
AND A LITTLE BIT OF MILK.

486
00:18:56,936 --> 00:18:59,637
            AGAIN, THOSE
     MEASUREMENT RATIOS I LOVE.

487
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:01,739
   AND WE'RE GONNA
CUT SOME SUGAR IN IT.

488
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:04,175
THEN WE'RE GONNA PUT OUR YOLKS
IN HERE AND MIX THAT TOGETHER.

489
00:19:04,277 --> 00:19:06,177
WE'RE GOING TO STRAIN THIS
  MIXTURE INTO OUR MILK,

490
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:08,613
   BECAUSE THERE COULD
BE SOME EGG WHITE IN HERE

491
00:19:08,715 --> 00:19:11,549
THAT WOULD CAUSE
SOMETHING FUNNY.
           SO YOU'RE JUST GONNA
           CONTINUE TO STIR THAT

492
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,017
             UNTIL IT THICKENS.

493
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:15,453
YOU GOT CORN STARCH IN THERE, SO
 THAT MIXTURE STARTS TO HEAT UP,

494
00:19:15,555 --> 00:19:17,855
                 THAT'LL REALLY
               START TO TIGHTEN.
LET'S GET OUR PIECRUST.

495
00:19:17,957 --> 00:19:20,391
                THAT LOOKS GOOD.
    WE'RE GOING
TO PUT SOME BUTTER.

496
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:24,362
               AND A LITTLE BIT
             OF VANILLA EXTRACT?
THAT'S MY SECRET.

497
00:19:24,464 --> 00:19:27,665
THAT'S VODKA!

498
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:31,335
YOU SEE WHY THEY
LIKE 'EM SO WELL.
                 WHOO! THEY ALL
               KEEP COMING BACK.

499
00:19:31,437 --> 00:19:34,138
       A LITTLE BIT OF COCONUT.

500
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,706
        WANT TO LICK THE SPOON?

501
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:39,443
                  THAT IS HEAVY.
WE SHOULD MAKE SOME
  MERINGUE FOR IT.

502
00:19:39,546 --> 00:19:42,380
              GET ANGRY WITH IT.
OH, I DO.

503
00:19:42,482 --> 00:19:46,617
            AND NOW A LITTLE BIT
                  OF SUGAR?

504
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:47,985
                      BRING IT.

505
00:19:48,087 --> 00:19:50,421
                   LOOK OUT.
               ROBBIE, THAT IS--

506
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:53,658
              THE MAGIC YOU DO
             WITH JUST A SPOON--

507
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,026
              A LITTLE COCONUT.

508
00:19:55,128 --> 00:19:57,428
     AND THAT'LL CRISP UP BROWN
     WHEN WE PUT IT IN THE OVEN.

509
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:58,963
             WOW, IT'S CHRISTMAS
               IN FLAVOR TOWN.

510
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:00,331
            LOOK AT THAT THING.

511
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:03,467
   I DON'T KNOW THAT I HAVE EVER
     JUMPED INTO AN ADVENTURE

512
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:06,704
          OF THAT MUCH OF THAT.

513
00:20:06,806 --> 00:20:10,041
            WOW. GOOD MERINGUE.

514
00:20:10,143 --> 00:20:11,642
     YOU'RE PRETTY EXCEPTIONAL.

515
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:15,079
 MY FAVORITE PART IS THE CRUNCHY
      COOKED COCONUT ON TOP.
MMM, YEAH.

516
00:20:15,181 --> 00:20:17,014
           LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
             COME TO KENTUCKY,

517
00:20:17,116 --> 00:20:18,216
             AND BUY YOUR PIES.

518
00:20:18,318 --> 00:20:21,085
IT'S JUST DELICIOUS.
     LIKE MY MOTHER USED TO FIX.

519
00:20:21,187 --> 00:20:22,653
          <i> LIKE JUANITA</i>
      <i> FIXES EVERYTHING...</i>

520
00:20:22,755 --> 00:20:24,722
ANYTHING ELSE
FOR YOU GUYS?

521
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:26,190
     <i> UP AND DOWN THE MENU.</i>

522
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:27,959
GOOD HOME COOKIN'.
                 IT'S DELICIOUS.

523
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:30,328
         VERY FEW PLACES
     SERVES FOOD LIKE THIS.

524
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:33,030
THEY'RE ALL HERE FOR YOUR HOME
COOKIN' LIKE MAMA USED TO MAKE.

525
00:20:33,132 --> 00:20:35,600
    A LOT OF HAPPY FOLKS.
I MEAN, THE PLACE IS PACKED.

526
00:20:35,702 --> 00:20:40,271
           YOU GAVE ME TOO MUCH.
OH, WELL, THAT'S BETTER
THAN NOT ENOUGH, RIGHT?

527
00:20:40,373 --> 00:20:42,506
 WELL, THAT'S IT FOR THIS TRIP,
        BUT DON'T WORRY.

528
00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:43,941
     I'LL BE LOOKING FOR YA

529
00:20:44,043 --> 00:20:47,011
  AT AMERICA'S GREATEST DINERS,
      DRIVE-INS AND DIVES.

530
00:20:47,113 --> 00:20:50,615
 LOOK AT THAT PARTY RIGHT THERE.

531
00:20:50,717 --> 00:20:53,384
        BUT I DON'T EVEN THINK
       A GREAT COLD MEXICAN BEER

532
00:20:53,486 --> 00:20:55,987
       AND A MARIACHI BAND WOULD
        HAVE MADE THAT GO DOWN.

YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T GET IN HERE
ON A SATURDAY OR SUNDAY MORNING.

162
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:53,645
WE GOTTA HAVE A PLACE

<i> BUT IT'LL STILL BE MAMA'S.</i>
IT'S THE PLACE TO GO.

168
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,893
YOU DON'T NEED TO BE FANCY.
 YOU JUST NEED TO BE GOOD.

169
00:07:07,995 --> 00:07:09,828
DON'T TRY TO GRAB SOMETHING
  OUT OF THAT SWEET BOOTH

WITHOUT TALKIN' TO HER FIRST.
  <i> AND MAMA WILL STILL</i>
   <i> BE IN CHARGE.</i>

 <i> TO MEET A CAT NAMED MATT.</i>

177
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:29,114
BREAKFAST ISN'T
  REALLY COMPLICATED.

178
00:07:29,216 --> 00:07:31,283
KEEP IT FRESH.
  COOK IT TO ORDER.
 <i> AND THE SIGN SAYS IT ALL.</i>

179
00:07:31,351 --> 00:07:33,051
DO YOU REALLY
    TASTE ANY OF IT?

180
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:37,456
'CAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE MOST
 OF IT'S ALL THE WAY OUT HERE.

181
00:07:37,558 --> 00:07:39,791
WHEN YOU'RE IN DOWNTOWN
  PHOENIX, ARIZONA,

182

CALLED MATT'S BIG BREAKFAST.

184
00:07:44,064 --> 00:07:45,730
NOW THIS DUDE
  DIGS BREAKFAST SO MUCH

185
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,966
HE DEVOTED AN ENTIRE
  RESTAURANT TO IT.

186
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:50,101
I JUST GOTTA MEET THIS CAT MATT.

187
00:07:50,204 --> 00:07:52,170
YOU DON'T BECOME
AN EGG GENERAL THAT EASY.

188
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:53,872
I'M SO EXCITED!
   THE HANDS ARE FLYIN'.

189
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:56,041
WHO'S HAVIN' THE BREAKFAST
   SPECIAL TODAY?
IT'S SO GOOD.

190
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:57,809
EGGS AND PORK CHOP
   IS VERY GOOD.

191
00:07:57,911 --> 00:07:59,978
THE ATMOSPHERE IS TINY
 AND SQUISHED AND COMPACT.

192
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,580
THAT'S WHAT'S
     GREAT ABOUT IT.
  CHRIS, PARTY OF ONE?

193
00:08:01,682 --> 00:08:03,548
IT'S THE BEST BREAKFAST
  IN TOWN, HANDS-DOWN.

194
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,383
IT FEELS MORE LIKE YOU'RE
 EATING BREAKFAST AT HOME.

195
00:08:05,486 --> 00:08:07,519
- IS MY MOM HERE?
-  I WOULD SAY  THE SPECIALTY

196
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:10,021
IS QUALITY.
   IT'S NOT YOUR
  REGULAR BREAKFAST.

197
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:12,390
<i> IT'S BREAKFAST BASICS DONE</i>
  <i> THE RIGHT WAY...</i>

198
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:14,626
IT'S SQUEEZED
    A LOT OF ORANGES.
 <i> TOTALLY FROM SCRATCH...</i>

199
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:16,995
BREAKFAST ISN'T REALLY
 COMPLICATED. KEEP IT FRESH.

200
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:19,030
<i>MADE WITH THE BEST INGREDIENTS.</i>

201
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:21,733
THE BACON HERE
 IS SO THICK AND PEPPERY.

202
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,802
WE DON'T EVEN OWN A FREEZER.
 WE DON'T OWN A MICROWAVE.

203
00:08:23,904 --> 00:08:26,238
WE DECIDED--
  THERE'S NO MICROWAVE
 AND NO FREEZER IN THIS JOINT?

204
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,573
NO MICROWAVE,
NO FREEZER, NOPE.
       WAFFLE?

205
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:31,009
WAFFLE'S PERFECT.
THEY'RE REALLY LIGHT,
 VERY DELICATE.

206
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:34,579
<i> 'CAUSE MAKIN' 'EM MATT POOL'S</i>
 <i> WAY MEANS MAKIN' FRESH BATTER</i>

207
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,081
<i> THREE TIMES A DAY.</i>

208
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:38,517
YOU WANT TO HELP ME CRACK,
OR SHOULD I JUST DO IT ALL?

209
00:08:38,619 --> 00:08:42,087
WELL, I'VE NEVER CRACKED
 IN TANDEM BEFORE.
     AND JAZZ HANDS!

210
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:44,556
WE GOT 2 CUPS
OF SUGAR HERE.

211
00:08:44,658 --> 00:08:46,558
WE'RE GONNA PUT SOME BUTTER
IN THERE--PUT IT IN MELTED.

212
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,560
NOW YOU'RE NOT WORRIED ABOUT
  KINDA POACHIN' THOSE EGGS

213
00:08:48,662 --> 00:08:51,563
A LITTLE BIT
   WITH THAT HOT BUTTER?
 WE'D WORRY IF I
DIDN'T START WHISKIN'.

214
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:55,700
OKAY.
THE FLOUR AND THE WHOLE MILK,
 AND WE'RE GONNA ADD THEM

215
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:58,670
IN ALTERNATE DOSES HERE.
     WHAA! WHAA!!

216
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:01,306
CAREFUL.
    HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY!

217
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:03,542
WE DO HAVE
   A MIXER HERE, RIGHT?
NO, NO, NO.

218
00:09:03,644 --> 00:09:06,711
WE DON'T HAVE ANY MIXER.
WE DON'T HAVE ROOM FOR A MIXER.

219
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:09,047
THEN WE ADD
   THE, UH, BAKING POWDER.

220
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:11,149
IT'S JUST A TEASPOON OF SALT.
   JUST LIKE CAKE BATTER.

221
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:13,218
THAT'S IT RIGHT THERE.
 PUT THAT DOWN.

222
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,120
GIVE IT A FLIP, AND IT
ONLY TAKES ABOUT A MINUTE.

223
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:17,489
SO YOU FLIP IT BACK OVER.
   IT'S LIKE A HIKING BOOT

224
00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:20,091
JUST WALKED ON A PANCAKE.

225
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:22,394
LOOK AT THAT THING!
 THAT'S A HOT FRISBEE OF FUN.

226
00:09:22,496 --> 00:09:25,030
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,
     WAIT, WAIT.

227
00:09:25,132 --> 00:09:27,599
GRANNY'S KETTLE
   ON THE FLATTOP ALL DAY

228
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:29,634
IS ACTUALLY HOT SYRUP?
IT'S HOT SYRUP
 READY TO GO.

229
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:32,103
YOU DON'T WANT TO PUT COLD
 SYRUP ON A HOT WAFFLE.

230
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:34,873
THAT'D KIND OF RUIN IT.
   IT'S GOT A CRU--
  A REALLY NICE CRUST TO IT.

231
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,541
LOOK AT THAT
     INSIDE THERE.

232
00:09:36,643 --> 00:09:39,144
YOU SEE HOW NICE AND LIGHT
    AND AIRY.

233
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:41,479
REALLY GOOD. I'D EAT THAT
 WAFFLE AGAIN IN A HEARTBEAT.

234
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:44,382
I GOTTA TELL YA, MAN,

235
00:09:44,484 --> 00:09:46,918
NON-BREAKFAST-ERS.

236
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,721
THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE.
   NON-BREAKFAST-ENERS?

237
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,990
<i> ACTUALLY...</i>
HOME FRIES

THE WAIT TURN INTO, LIKE,

239
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,994

    OR WEEKEND?
HOUR AND A HALF.

OH, YEAH, IT'S WORTH
 THE WAIT FOR SURE.

241

  PARTY OF TWO, PLEASE.

242
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,001
GREGORY!
   WE DROVE ALL THE WAY
   FROM NORTH SCOTTSDALE

243
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:06,638

IT'S REALLY, REALLY,
 REALLY GOOD.

244
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,807
WHAT DO YOU LIKE
     ABOUT IT HERE?
HMM...

245
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:10,542
MY DADDY OWNS IT.

246
00:10:10,644 --> 00:10:12,978
I STILL REMEMBER, YOU KNOW,
 GOIN' TO A LITTLE COFFEE SHOP.

247
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,980
MY DAD LOVED COFFEE SHOPS.

248
00:10:15,082 --> 00:10:16,982
HE ALWAYS SAT
AT THE COUNTER.

249
00:10:17,084 --> 00:10:18,984
I JUST FIGURED THERE WERE PEOPLE
 HERE THAT WOULD APPRECIATE

250
00:10:19,086 --> 00:10:21,252
JUST OLD-FASHIONED,
MOM-AND-POP RUN RESTAURANTS.
  <i> SO THREE YEARS AGO,</i>

251
00:10:21,355 --> 00:10:23,021
<i> HE AND HIS WIFE ERENIA...</i>
HI, HOW ARE YOU?

252
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:25,490
<i> GOT A COUNTER OF THEIR OWN.</i>
I'M HERE
ALMOST EVERY OTHER DAY.

253
00:10:25,592 --> 00:10:26,925
<i> IT FILLED UP QUICK.</i>
WELCOME TO PHOENIX.

254
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:29,260
HOW ARE YOU, MAYOR?
DO YOU ENJOY THE SAME THING

255
00:10:29,363 --> 00:10:32,263
EACH TIME YOU COME IN?
   NO, I LIKE THE WAFFLES
    OR THE OMELETS.

256
00:10:32,366 --> 00:10:34,265
THE WAFFLES
  WITH THE REAL MAPLE SYRUP.

257
00:10:34,368 --> 00:10:37,168
<i>AND IT'S THAT REAL THING THAT'S</i>
 <i> KEEPIN' THIS JOINT PACKED.</i>

258
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:40,405
EVERY PIECE OF MY BREAKFAST
   IS SO GOOD.

259
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:42,374
WE GET ALL OF OUR PORK FROM
A LITTLE LOCAL BUTCHER SHOP.

260
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:45,043
THEY DON'T DELIVER,
 AND I PAY RETAIL.

261
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,911
IT'S THE CRAZIEST THING
  IN THE WORLD.
   ONCE YOU HAVE
  THE BACON HERE,

262
00:10:47,014 --> 00:10:48,947
YOU'LL NEVER EAT BACON
 ANYWHERE ELSE YOUR WHOLE LIFE.

263
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:50,949
THIS IS LIKE WINE
    TASTING FOR ME.

264
00:10:51,051 --> 00:10:53,385
I'M GONNA CLEANSE
  MY PALATE WITH THE BACON.

265
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:55,820
IT'S AS THICK AS A HAM STEAK.
  GREAT TEXTURE TO IT.

266
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:57,956
WHOLE GRAIN BREAD--YOU KNOW THAT
 THEY MAKE THIS STUFF SLICED?

267
00:10:58,058 --> 00:11:00,291
I DON'T LIKE
   UNIFORMITY OF BREAD.

268
00:11:00,394 --> 00:11:02,694
THE MAN HAS AN ISSUE
WITH UNIFORMITY OF BREAD.

269
00:11:02,796 --> 00:11:05,430
AND THEN WE SERVE IT
    WITH A LITTLE BIT

270
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:07,232
OF HOMEMADE LOCAL PRESERVES.
MMM!

271
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:09,701
IT'S LIKE AN OPEN-FACED
    JELLY DOUGHNUT.

272
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:12,337
MOST OF IT'S
   ALL THE WAY OUT HERE.

273
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:13,872
THERE YOU GO.

274
00:11:13,974 --> 00:11:16,207
<i> AND MATT'S PUTTIN' FRESH</i>
 <i> ROSEMARY IN HIS HOME FRIES...</i>

00:17:11,064 --> 00:17:13,164
LIKE PIGS IN THE BLANKET
  GONE WILD?
       YEAH.

415

GOT SOME EGGS, POTATOES,
 SAUSAGE, SOME CHEESE.

416
00:17:15,835 --> 00:17:19,637
IT'S GOOD.
  CALLED A PANCAKE BURRITO--
    PANCAKE GYRO.

417
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:22,607
THAT'S GOOD, YOU SAID "YOU-RO."
 A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY "JI-RO."

418
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:27,111
BUT GYRO, THAT'S, UH...
    IT'S NOT MY FIRST
    PANCAKE RODEO.

THEY HAVE A LOT OF
 DIFFERENT PANCAKE WRAPS HERE.

PUT A LITTLE OLIVE OIL.
    I LIKE YOUR

I SEE WHY IT'S SO POPULAR.

478
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:02,433
AND I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST
   A PANCAKE FACTORY.
 <i> NOT THAT THERE'S ANYTHING</i>
  <i> WRONG WITH THAT.</i>

479
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:04,402
THE PANCAKES ARE REALLY THICK
  AND, LIKE, CAKE-LIKE.

480

WHEN YOU'RE THINKIN' BARBECUE,

28
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:05,364
YOU'RE PROBABLY THINKIN' TEXAS,
 MEMPHIS, NORTH CAROLINA,

I'M HERE IN GARDENA, CALIFORNIA,

 YOU PREFER?
      MILD SAUCE.

37

YOU AT MY PLAYGROUND NOW.
  WHAT ABOUT THEM GREENS?

  <i> IS THE REAL DEAL.</i>

42
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:41,934
- SO WHICH ONE, BEEF OR PORK?
-        PORK.

43
00:01:42,036 --> 00:01:45,304
WE HAVE BEEF RIBS, PORK RIBS
  AND A PORK SANDWICH.

44
00:01:45,406 --> 00:01:46,805
IT'S DELICIOUS.

45
00:01:48,809 --> 00:01:52,010
AND THIS PROBABLY
  WAS MY REAL INTRODUCTION

46
00:01:52,113 --> 00:01:54,012
- TO SOUTHERN-STYLE BARBECUE.
- REALLY?

47
00:01:54,115 --> 00:01:55,514
IT WAS PULLED PORK.

48
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:57,516
I REMEMBER EATIN' IT GOIN',

49
00:01:57,618 --> 00:02:01,053
"OH. THIS IS THE BEST
   THING I'VE EVER HAD."

50
00:02:01,155 --> 00:02:03,155
OH, THIS IS THE BEST
   IN THE WEST.

51
00:02:03,257 --> 00:02:05,157
HOW'S IT GOIN'?
     HOW YOU DOIN'?
OKAY.

 RIGHT, I'M GONNA FUSS ABOUT IT.

I WANT EVERY--EVERY
  FOOD THAT I SERVE--

58
00:02:17,705 --> 00:02:20,439
I WANT IT TO GO OUT THE WAY I
WOULD WANT TO BUY IT AND EAT IT.

59
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:22,441

PLACES IN MEMPHIS--INTERSTATE.

YEAH, JAMES--JIM NEELY.
      GET OUT!

65
00:02:35,156 --> 00:02:37,289
THAT'S HOW--
   YOU ARE NOT SERIOUS!

66
00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:40,292
INTERSTATE BAR-B-QUE
    IS RENOWNED.
YES.

67
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:42,828
ARE THESE THE RECIPES
     FROM HIM?
SAME RECIPES.

<i> SAME HICKORY SMOKIN',</i>
  <i> SAME SPARE RIBS...</i>

WITH THE DRY RUB?

70
00:02:47,868 --> 00:02:49,268
<i> SAME DRY RUB</i>

71
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,303
<i> WITH CHILI POWDER,</i>
 <i> SEASONED SALT AND PAPRIKA.</i>

72
00:02:51,405 --> 00:02:52,804
OUT IN CALIFORNIA,

73
00:02:52,907 --> 00:02:55,040
WE TEND TO SEE A LOT
MORE BABY BACK RIBS,

74
00:02:55,142 --> 00:02:56,875
BUT I REALLY THINK--
MY PERSONAL PREFERENCE

75
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:58,710
IS THAT THE ST. LOUIS--
 THE SPARE RIB--

76
00:02:58,812 --> 00:03:00,379
HAS MORE MEAT
AND MORE FLAVOR.

77
00:03:00,481 --> 00:03:02,447
MOISTER, YOU KNOW,
  IT'S A LITTLE MORE JUICIER.

78
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:05,450
AND THESE ARE GONNA GO ON
 AT 225 FOR 4 HOURS?

79
00:03:05,553 --> 00:03:07,286
YES, SIR.

80
00:03:07,388 --> 00:03:08,787
WOW.

81
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:10,923
AND HERE YOU KNOW--
 YOU TELL YOUR RIBS ARE DONE--

82
00:03:11,025 --> 00:03:12,758
YOU HOLD 'EM
    FROM THE BACK HERE.

83
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,593
IF THEY BREAK APART,
  THAT'S HOW TENDER IT IS.

84
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:16,428
YOU DON'T WANT 'EM
TOTALLY FALLIN' APART,

85
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,764
BUT YOU WANT 'EM
TO HAVE A GOOD...
      OH, YEAH.

86
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:20,532
LOOK AT THAT.
       YEAH.

87
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:23,101
I'M SORRY YOU'RE NOT GONNA
GET TO EAT TODAY, CURTIS.
  YEAH, I'M GONNA EAT TODAY.

88
00:03:23,204 --> 00:03:25,437
SO THE SAUCE DOESN'T GO ON IT
  UNTIL IT COMES OUT.

89
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:28,207
THAT'S THE WAY TO DO IT.
       RIGHT.

90
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:32,010
MMM. TENDER.
    GREAT SMOKE FLAVOR.

91
00:03:32,112 --> 00:03:34,813
THAT IS SO GOOD.
   I CAN'T EVEN TELL YOU.

92
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:36,815
HERE YOU GO.

93
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:39,484
SAUCE--A LITTLE SWEET
    WITH SOME TANG.

94
00:03:39,587 --> 00:03:42,821
SO HOW MANY TIMES
DO YOU MAKE SAUCE A WEEK?

95
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:45,324
MAKE IT THREE TIMES
    A DAY, BROTHER.

96
00:03:45,426 --> 00:03:48,327
I LIKE IT FRESH.
    KETCHUP AND PASTE.
AND PASTE.

97
00:03:48,429 --> 00:03:51,330
CORN SYRUP.
  VINEGAR--NOW THAT'S WHAT'S
   GIVIN' IT THAT TANG,

98
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:53,031
THAT WANG THAT YOU GET.

99
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:54,533
THIS IS THE SECRET.

100
00:03:54,635 --> 00:03:57,669
MUSTARD. YOU GOT THE ONION
  POWDER, THE GARLIC POWDER.

101
00:03:57,771 --> 00:03:59,671
IT LOOKS LIKE SOME CAYENNE,
   SOME PAPRIKA,

102
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:01,673
BROWN SUGAR,
     REGULAR SUGAR.
PRETTY MUCH.

103
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:03,675
THAT CLOSE ENOUGH?
     SALT, PEPPER.
CLOSE ENOUGH.

104
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:05,444
YOU WANT ME
    TO STIR THIS UP?

105
00:04:05,546 --> 00:04:07,446
NO, NOT YET. SO WE'LL
STIR EVERY 15 MINUTES.

106
00:04:07,548 --> 00:04:09,881
EVERY 15 MINUTES, YOU MAKE
  SURE THAT SOMEONE STIRS IT.

107
00:04:09,984 --> 00:04:11,183
THAT'S RIGHT.

108
00:04:11,285 --> 00:04:13,685
I FEEL BAD WIPIN' SAUCE
    OFF MY LIPS.

109
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:16,321
THAT'S JUST--THAT'S WRONG.
  I SHOULD JUST LICK IT OFF.

110

<i> AND YOU CAN GET IT</i>
 <i> WITH EVERYTHING HERE...</i>

THAT'S RIGHT.

120

 NEVER HAD ANYTHING LIKE IT.

121

I COME ALL THE WAY
  DOWN HERE FROM ONTARIO

IT'S OUR ROMANTIC SATURDAY
 NIGHT DINNER.

127
00:04:53,227 --> 00:04:55,927
AND, YOU KNOW, IT HAS GREAT
  FLAVOR, BUT GOOD STUFF.

128
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:58,163
SO BONE-IN PORK SHOULDER.
YEAH, I GOT BONE-IN.

129
00:04:58,265 --> 00:05:00,832

     THAT'S WHERE
     THE FLAVOR IS.

130
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:03,335

   WITH THE DRY RUB AGAIN.
DO LIKE WE DID.

GET UP INSIDE ANY

00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:40,038
PULL IT APART. SEE,
NOW YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO--

146
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,040
I DON'T HAVE TO PUT
NO PRESSURE ON IT.

147
00:05:42,142 --> 00:05:43,709
IT JUST PULLS APART.

148
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:45,377
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

149

NO. NO, NO, NO, NO.

151
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,150
A PULLED PORK SANDWICH
   IS YOU PULL IT.

152
00:05:52,252 --> 00:05:54,152
THAT'S WHY THEY CALL IT
   A PULLED PORK.

153
00:05:54,254 --> 00:05:55,654
NOT PULL IT LIKE THAT.

154
00:05:55,756 --> 00:05:57,656
YOU HAVE TO PULL IT
   LIKE THIS, SEE?

155
00:05:57,758 --> 00:05:59,658
AND YOU PUT IT
  ON THE BUN LIKE THIS.

156
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,993
THAT'S WHAT I WAS SAYIN'
   THE WHOLE TIME, BEV.

157
00:06:02,096 --> 00:06:03,995
YEAH, BUT THIS IS PULLED.

HE'S A TENDERFOOT
  BECAUSE IT'S HOT,

159
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:07,899
BUT, SEE, MAMA'S USED
   TO SOME HEAT.

160
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:09,568
MAMA'S USED TO--
OOH!

161
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:12,237
MAMA USED TO HEAT.
    I HATE WHEN I GET
     IN TROUBLE.

162
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:15,140
TAKE A LITTLE OF--
    NOW WHEN DO I PUT
    THE SAUCE ON, NOW?

NOPE.
        NO?

164
00:06:16,744 --> 00:06:18,643
YOU DUMP IT
  ON TOP LIKE THAT.

165
00:06:18,746 --> 00:06:21,680
NOW WE POUR SOME SAUCE.

166
00:06:21,782 --> 00:06:24,416
THE SECRET IS TO POUR
 A LITTLE SAUCE LIKE THIS.

167
00:06:24,518 --> 00:06:26,651
STOP.

168
00:06:26,754 --> 00:06:29,321
PRESS IT DOWN A LITTLE BIT.
   LET IT SOAK IN.

00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:34,393
WE WANT TO DROWN IT
   WITH SAUCE.

171
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:36,895

PULLED PORK SANDWICH.

173
00:06:38,499 --> 00:06:40,732
DO YOU THINK I SHOULD JUST
  GO WITHOUT THE HANDS

174
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:43,402
AND GO IN LIKE A TROUGH?
  OH, JUST GO AHEAD ON.
   IT'S OKAY.

175
00:06:43,504 --> 00:06:45,804
YOU'RE AT HOME WHEN YOU'RE HERE.
  JUST PICK IT UP.

THAT'S WHAT YOU CALL
  A PULLED--
    THAT'S SOME GOOD
     PULLED PORK.

179
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:55,714

SO HOW'S EVERYTHING
 HERE SO FAR?

222

WE PUT A LITTLE EXTRA

255
00:09:40,881 --> 00:09:43,181
WE JUST PUT A LAYER OF PEPPER

SHIELD OF BLACK PEPPER COMES IN.

271
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:20,385

00:10:52,853 --> 00:10:55,086

 A HOBBY FOR A GOOD LONG TIME.

287

<i> LONG ENOUGH TO TRY TO CHANGE</i>
 <i> CHICAGO'S MIND ABOUT RIBS.</i>

294
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:12,003
I'M GONNA DO THE HALF SLAB
   OF ST. LOUIS.

295
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:14,506
PEOPLE THAT ARE USED TO BABY
 BACKS HAVE BEEN ORDERING THESE

296
00:11:14,608 --> 00:11:16,341
AND GOIN',
"I LIKE THIS BETTER."

297
00:11:16,443 --> 00:11:18,176
PUT A THIN COATING

298
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:20,178
PUT A MUCH HEAVIER
COATING ON THE TOP.

299
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,180
YOU WANT TO JUST
KINDA BARELY BE ABLE

300
00:11:22,282 --> 00:11:23,848
TO SEE THE MEAT
THROUGH THE RUB.

301
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:26,251

YEP, THEY CAN.

304
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:31,623
NOT TOO MUCH SMOKE.

305
00:11:31,725 --> 00:11:34,125
IT COMES OFF THE BONE CLEAN,

306
00:11:34,227 --> 00:11:36,428
BUT IT DOESN'T FALL OFF THE BONE
  LIKE A PIT STEAM.

307
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:37,796
THEY'RE GOOD RIBS.

A TOMATO-BASED SAUCE

314
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,675

THEY'RE THE BEST
  CHICKEN WINGS AROUND.

YEAH.

471
00:17:42,996 --> 00:17:45,396
A LOT OF WORK FOR

THESE PARTICULAR ONES
I GREW IN MY GARDEN.

OKAY.
OF THE JALAPEÑO.

YEP. CORE THE JALAPEÑOS
WITH THE CHILI TWISTER.

503
00:19:01,341 --> 00:19:03,741
NOW TELL ME ABOUT
  THIS CREAM CHEESE THING.

504
00:19:03,843 --> 00:19:07,211
OKAY. TAKE JUST YOUR
STANDARD CREAM CHEESE

505
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:09,046

 A LITTLE BIT

WE'LL TAKE IT
A STEP FURTHER.

509
00:19:15,455 --> 00:19:18,656
I USE A WATER CHESTNUT
 MARINATED OVERNIGHT

510
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:21,692
IN A LITTLE BROWN SUGAR
 AND SOME SOY SAUCE.

511
00:19:21,794 --> 00:19:24,395
I HAVE SEEN SOME FUNNY THINGS
  TO STUFF A PEPPER WITH,

512
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:26,731
BUT THIS MIGHT BE
    THE TOP OF IT--

513
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,033
A WATER CHESTNUT.

514
00:19:29,135 --> 00:19:31,602
AND THEN SOME MORE CHEESE?

515
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:33,804
ALL RIGHT, NOW WE'RE READY
  FOR THE BACON.

516

TO MEET IN THE SAME SPOT?

518
00:19:37,544 --> 00:19:40,111
THAT'D BE A GOOD THING.
    AND THEN GO RIGHT
    THROUGH THE CENTER.

519
00:19:40,213 --> 00:19:42,113
AND NOW WE'RE GONNA
   SPRINKLE THE DRY RUB--

520
00:19:42,215 --> 00:19:44,982
THE UNIVERSAL DRY RUB...
JUST A LITTLE BIT.

521
00:19:45,084 --> 00:19:46,984
KINDA USE IT LIKE PAPRIKA

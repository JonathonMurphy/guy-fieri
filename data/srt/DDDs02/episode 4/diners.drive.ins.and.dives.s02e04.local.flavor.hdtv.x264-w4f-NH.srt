  <i> IS TRUE TO ITS NAME.</i>

42
00:01:47,074 --> 00:01:49,908
THIS IS YOUR STANDARD
    MIKE'S BOWL.
 <i> ON WHATEVER YOU ORDER.</i>

43
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:52,244

   54 BUCKS?

47
00:01:59,587 --> 00:02:01,787
YOU GOTTA REALLY, REALLY

  <i> THEY'RE COMING FOR.</i>

50
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,860
I LIKE MIKE'S CHILI--
JUST A PLAIN BOWL OF CHILI

51
00:02:07,962 --> 00:02:09,628
WITH CHEESE AND ONIONS.

THERE'S SOMETHING
  JUST MAGIC ABOUT IT.

53
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:14,566
I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT IS.
  PHIL WON'T TELL US.

54
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:17,202
<i> BECAUSE THE RECIPE HAS BEEN</i>
<i>A CLOSELY GUARDED FAMILY SECRET</i>

    NOT WRITTEN DOWN?

57
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:25,244
NOT WRITTEN DOWN ANYWHERE.
 <i> INSTEAD IT'S BEEN PASSED DOWN</i>

<i> FROM MIKE'S GREAT-GRANDFATHER,</i>
  <i> ALSO NAMED MIKE.</i>

59
00:02:28,149 --> 00:02:31,116
YOUR GREAT-GRANDFATHER
   CAME HERE FROM GREECE.
 RIGHT.

60
00:02:31,218 --> 00:02:33,519
AND LIKE A LOT OF GREEKS,
 DECIDES TO START COOKING,

61
00:02:33,621 --> 00:02:35,521
SO HE'S COOKING
  IN A RESTAURANT,

62
00:02:35,623 --> 00:02:37,656
COMES UP WITH THIS GREAT
 CHILI RECIPE, DECIDES HE WANTS

63
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:40,659
TO LEAVE AND OPEN
  HIS OWN RESTAURANT.
   <i> IN 1939,</i>
  <i> HE BUILT THIS PLACE</i>

YOU AND YOUR DAD
   TOOK IT OVER TOGETHER.
RIGHT.

66
00:02:44,565 --> 00:02:47,366
<i> IN '66, PHIL STARTED</i>
 <i> RUNNING THE PLACE HIMSELF.</i>

67
00:02:47,468 --> 00:02:50,302
<i> 20 YEARS LATER,</i>
  <i> MIKE JUMPED IN.</i>
SUCK IT IN, BIG GUY.

68
00:02:50,404 --> 00:02:52,604
<i>TOGETHER, THEY'RE PROUD TO TELL</i>
  <i> YOU THEY'VE CHANGED</i>

69
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:55,307

WHERE ARE MY CRACKERS,
MIKE?

70
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:57,609
<i> ESPECIALLY</i>
  <i> WHAT'S IN THE BOWL.</i>

71
00:02:57,711 --> 00:02:59,611
WE DON'T MAKE IT WITH BEANS.

72
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:01,680
WE DON'T MAKE IT WITH ANYTHING
  ELSE THAT I'VE ALWAYS

73
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:04,283
KIND OF CALLED FILLER STUFF.
  WE SERVE IT OVER BEANS.

74
00:03:04,385 --> 00:03:06,285
I THINK THAT REALLY IS
  WHAT MAKES IT SPECIAL.

75
00:03:06,387 --> 00:03:09,288
WE JUST PUT THE MEAT
 AND THE SECRET SPICE RECIPE

76
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:10,389
THAT MY, YOU KNOW,
  GREAT-GRANDFATHER

77
00:03:10,491 --> 00:03:13,325
STARTED IN THE '20s.

78
00:03:13,427 --> 00:03:15,427
<i> IT'S ALSO THE ALL-DAY</i>
  <i> COOKING PROCESS</i>

79
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:18,564
<i> THAT STARTS WITH BEEF STOCK,</i>
  <i> ONIONS AND GARLIC.</i>

80
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:20,632
WE DIDN'T SAUTéE 'EM.
WE JUST THREW 'EM ALL--

81
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:22,634
EVERYBODY IN THE POOL.
     THAT'S RIGHT.

82
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:24,636
NOW THE MEAT.
OKAY, SO MIX, MIX, MIX.

83
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:26,538
UNTIL IT BREAKS DOWN.
UNTIL IT ALL BREAKS DOWN.

84
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,841
THIS IS LIKE YOUR OWN
  LITTLE ATHLETIC WORKOUT.
YOU WANNA ARM WRESTLE?

85
00:03:29,944 --> 00:03:31,977
MAYBE. SO WE'RE MAKING
  WHAT WE'RE CALLING SAUCE?

86
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:34,112
WE'RE MAKING THE SAUCE.

87
00:03:34,215 --> 00:03:36,081
YOU SEE, OUR CHILI

88
00:03:36,183 --> 00:03:38,083
AND OUR BEANS--

89
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:40,085
THEY NEVER GET
MIXED TOGETHER

90
00:03:40,187 --> 00:03:43,088
UNLESS YOU WANT 'EM
TOGETHER IN A BOWL.
   BECAUSE TRUE CHILI--

91
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:46,258
BY MOST PEOPLE'S STANDARDS--
   IS MEAT ONLY.
THAT'S IT.

92
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,027
THIS IS HOW YOU'VE
 ALWAYS DONE IT.
       ALWAYS.

93
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:51,029
<i> AND WITH IT ALL RIGHT OUT</i>

  <i> MAKE IT FROM SCRATCH.</i>

95
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,400

  GET SCARED IF THEY WALK IN

96
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:57,402
AND THEY DON'T SEE
    THAT POT COOKIN'.

97
00:03:57,504 --> 00:03:59,504
YEAH, THAT'S TRUE.
SOMETIMES THEY DO.

98
00:03:59,607 --> 00:04:01,974
<i> AFTER SEVERAL HOURS</i>
   <i> OF SIMMERING,</i>

 <i> FOR THE BIG BAG OF SPICES.</i>

100
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:07,946

  SPICES GOING ON IN HERE.
MM-HMM.

101
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:11,650
WHAT IS IN THIS?
OH, A WHOLE BUNCH OF STUFF.

102
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:13,452
THERE'S GOTTA BE
    SOME CHILI POWDER.

103
00:04:13,554 --> 00:04:15,053
THAT'S WHAT IT--
      OREGANO.

104
00:04:15,155 --> 00:04:18,056
I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE
 ANY INTENTION OF TELLING ME.
NO--YOU'RE RIGHT.

105
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:20,559
BUT AT LEAST I--
     NO, ABSOLUTELY.

106
00:04:20,661 --> 00:04:23,562
NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.
THAT'S MORE THAN I'VE EVER
 DONE FOR ANYBODY--

107
00:04:23,664 --> 00:04:25,564
FOR ANYBODY ELSE?
     I'M ITALIAN.

108
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:28,667
GREEKS ARE ALMOST
     ITALIANS.
NO, NO, NO, NO.

109
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:30,636
SO HOW MUCH LONGER
   IS THIS GONNA HANG OUT?

110
00:04:30,738 --> 00:04:35,107
WELL, ACTUALLY JUST
A LITTLE WHILE NOW.

111
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:37,109
BE CAREFUL.

112
00:04:37,211 --> 00:04:39,111
WHY?

113
00:04:39,213 --> 00:04:41,113
IT'S ADDICTING?
IT'S ADDICTING.

114
00:04:41,215 --> 00:04:44,116
BE CAREFUL.
     WE WARNED YOU.
THAT'S THE ONLY BAD THING
 ABOUT THIS CHILI.

115
00:04:44,218 --> 00:04:47,119
MM, THAT'S TASTY.

116
00:04:47,221 --> 00:04:50,122
ISN'T IT?
  YOU GUYS SHOULD CALL THIS,
   LIKE, A CHILI PARLOR.

117
00:04:50,224 --> 00:04:52,858
IT'D BE A GOOD NAME.

118
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,661
<i> WHILE LOTS OF FOLKS</i>
 <i> GO FOR THE BASIC BOWL...</i>

119
00:04:55,763 --> 00:04:57,362
YOU GET OYSTER CRACKERS.
   THAT'S A MUST.

120
00:04:57,464 --> 00:05:00,666
<i> IT'S THE CHILI COMBOS THAT'LL</i>
 <i> REALLY SPIN YOUR HEAD AROUND.</i>

121
00:05:00,768 --> 00:05:03,101
FAVORITE WAY TO EAT MIKE'S
 CHILI IS IN A CHILI BURGER.

122
00:05:03,203 --> 00:05:06,238
RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE.
HOW MUCH IS IT?

123
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,240
6 BUCKS.
      6 BUCKS.

124
00:05:08,342 --> 00:05:10,842
FEED A FAMILY. COME ON DOWN
 TO MIKE'S CHILI PARLOR.

125
00:05:10,944 --> 00:05:12,878
GO CHEESE FIRST?
    YEAH, CHEESE FIRST.

126
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,980
ALL RIGHT,
    WE'RE GOING ONIONS.

127
00:05:15,082 --> 00:05:17,316
THAT'S A LITTLE SOFT
   FOR A GUY LIKE YOU.

128
00:05:17,418 --> 00:05:19,318
OKAY, NOW WE'RE TALKIN'.

129
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,320
NOW WE'RE TALKIN'.
    NOW WE'RE TALKIN'.

130
00:05:21,422 --> 00:05:23,655
YOU WANT ME TO DO THE PEPPERS
  FOR YOU THIS TIME?

131
00:05:23,757 --> 00:05:25,657
NO. YOU'VE BEEN RIDICULOUS

132
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,559
ON ALL OF THE OTHER
 VOLUME PORTIONS.

133
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,561
IS THAT ENOUGH?
   I THINK IT'S PERFECT.

134
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:32,931
OKAY. CAN SOMEONE
REALLY EAT THAT?
   OH, YEAH, DEFINITELY.

135
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:37,302
DO YOU WANT A DEEP BREATH--
TAKE A DEEP BREATH OR SOMETHING?

136
00:05:37,404 --> 00:05:40,405
THAT'S A PRIMO CHILI BURGER.
   NICE SPICE TO IT.

137
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:42,240
IT'S VERY FLAVORFUL.

138
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:45,243
THE CHEESE MELTS REALLY QUICK,
  'CAUSE IT'S CUT THIN.
YEP.

139
00:05:45,346 --> 00:05:48,246
THEN YOU GET THE REAL
    MEATY TEXTURE

140

BUT I GOTTA TELL YA,

144

279
00:11:29,172 --> 00:11:31,439
I'M GONNA ASSUME
  IT'S SWEET TATER'S RECIPE.

280
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:34,542
GET THE EGG
OUT OF THE WAY.
   THE EGGS, THE SPICES,

281
00:11:34,644 --> 00:11:37,545
AND I'M KIND OF
     THE SAME WAY--
 YOU WANT ME TO SET IT
ON HIGH AND HIT IT FAST?

282
00:11:37,647 --> 00:11:38,980
YEAH.

283
00:11:39,082 --> 00:11:41,850
THROW IT IN THE OVEN
    ABOUT 45 MINUTES,

284
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:44,619
AND WE USE A SCOOP.
 <i> NOW ADD THE CHICKEN...</i>

285
00:11:44,721 --> 00:11:46,621
SHRED IT?
     NO, WE JUST--

286
00:11:46,723 --> 00:11:49,824
THROW IT ON THERE?

    THROW IT ON THERE.

287
00:11:49,926 --> 00:11:53,561
AND THEN THIS IS OUR
   YELLOW CHICKEN GRAVY.

288
00:11:58,201 --> 00:12:00,101
OH, GET OUTTA HERE.

289
00:12:00,203 --> 00:12:02,103

00:12:25,562 --> 00:12:27,462
YOU GOTTA EVOLVE.
  PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS CHANGING,

301
00:12:27,564 --> 00:12:29,464
EXCEPT THEY'LL SAY,
   "HEY, THAT'S GREAT.

302
00:12:29,566 --> 00:12:31,599
LET'S TRY THAT ON THE MENU.

<i> COMING UP,</i>
  <i> WE'RE HEADING WEST</i>

     SINCE 1890?
YEAH, 1894.

308
00:12:44,214 --> 00:12:46,548
IT'S A FANTASTIC
   PLACE TO COME.

309
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:48,683
<i> WHERE THE LOCAL FLAVORS</i>
 <i> ARE TOTALLY CALIFORNIA.</i>

310
00:12:48,785 --> 00:12:50,518
OH, SO GOOD.

311
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:55,890
CRUISIN' THE COAST
  IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA,

312
00:12:55,992 --> 00:12:57,892
YOU GOTTA LOVE IT--

313
00:12:57,994 --> 00:12:59,961
THE OCEAN, THE SEAFOOD,
   THE FARMS.

314
00:13:00,063 --> 00:13:01,963
WELL,
  THERE'S THIS COOL PLACE

315
00:13:02,065 --> 00:13:03,965
IN A LITTLE TOWN
  CALLED PESCADERO

316
00:13:04,067 --> 00:13:06,501
WHERE THE DUARTE FAMILY HAS BEEN
 SERVING UP RIGHTEOUS FOOD

317
00:13:06,603 --> 00:13:08,503
FOR OVER FOUR GENERATIONS.

318
00:13:08,605 --> 00:13:10,538
UH-HUH.

319
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,374
IT'S GREAT.
 THERE'S NOTHING ON THE MENU

320
00:13:13,477 --> 00:13:15,777
THAT I WOULDN'T ORDER AGAIN.

321
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:18,480
THIS TIME WE'RE GOING
 WITH A CRAB MELT.
  FRESH CRACKED CRAB--
   IT'S A GIVEN.

322
00:13:18,582 --> 00:13:21,516
THAT'S WHAT
 WE COME DOWN AND WE HAVE.
BE RIGHT BACK
FOR THE CLAMS.

323
00:13:21,618 --> 00:13:24,452
<i> FROM OYSTERS ON THE HALF SHELL</i>
  <i> TO FRESH COHO TROUT...</i>

324
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:27,522
EVERYTHING I'VE HAD
HERE IS REALLY GOOD.
  <i> THERE'S NO MISTAKIN'</i>

325
00:13:27,624 --> 00:13:29,924
<i> WHAT DUARTE'S TAVERN</i>
<i> IS ALL ABOUT.</i>
IT'S GREAT.

326
00:13:30,026 --> 00:13:32,427
ONE OF THE IDEALS OF
THE RESTAURANT WAY BACK WHEN

327
00:13:32,529 --> 00:13:34,996
WAS TO FEATURE
LOCAL PRODUCTS.

328
00:13:35,098 --> 00:13:37,499
IT'S BEEN HERE
     SINCE 1890?

329
00:13:37,601 --> 00:13:39,767
YEAH, 1894.
       1894.

330
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,936
THAT WAS JUST THE BAR.
THEN MOST OF ALL THIS--

331
00:13:42,038 --> 00:13:44,939
YEAH, BUT GRANTED--
THEN MOST OF ALL THIS
  WAS 1935.

332
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:47,942
YEAH. 1935--THAT'S
  QUITE A BIT OF NOSTALGIA.
YEAH, YEAH.

333
00:13:48,044 --> 00:13:50,945
<i> FOR TIM DUARTE, EVERYTHING'S</i>
 <i> GOTTA BE AT LEAST AS GOOD</i>

334
00:13:51,047 --> 00:13:53,948
<i> AS IT'S ALWAYS BEEN...</i>
YEAH, THAT'S MY DAD
 FISHERMAN RON.

335
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:55,950
<i> SO HE'S STAYING TRUE</i>
  <i> TO THE OLD RECIPES,</i>

336
00:13:56,052 --> 00:13:57,952
<i> LIKE CRAP CIOPPINO,</i>
  <i> KIND OF A SEAFOOD STEW</i>

337
00:13:58,054 --> 00:14:00,955
<i> - FILLED WITH FRESH</i> <i> DUNGENESS CRAB.
- </i> IN MY OPINION...

338
00:14:01,057 --> 00:14:03,958
YEAH.
     NOTHING BETTER     THAN THE DUNGENESS.

339
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:06,194
YOU KNOW, AND THEN WE'RE
SO CLOSE TO HALF MOON BAY,

340
00:14:06,296 --> 00:14:09,197
WE CAN GET--YOU KNOW, WE HAVE--
 RIGHT OFF THE BOAT BASICALLY.

341
00:14:09,299 --> 00:14:12,033
WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME
 CRACKING CRAB.

342
00:14:12,135 --> 00:14:14,536
SO THERE'S A PINCHER.
  YOU CAN SEE IT'S CRACKED,

343
00:14:14,638 --> 00:14:17,038
CRACKED, CRACKED AT EVERY JOINT,
  BUT STILL INTACT,

344
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:20,041
BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT A WHOLE
 BUNCH OF LITTLE, TINY PIECES.

345
00:14:20,143 --> 00:14:23,011
YOU WANT LEGS IN THERE,
  SO WE'LL PUT IT IN HERE.

346
00:14:23,113 --> 00:14:25,780
SO WE GOT SOME CLAMS.
  THREE LITTLE NECK CLAMS.

347
00:14:25,882 --> 00:14:27,715
PER ORDER?
      PER ORDER.

348
00:14:27,817 --> 00:14:32,487
WE PUT THREE JUMBO
   WHITE PRAWNS PER ORDER.

349
00:14:32,589 --> 00:14:34,822
WE PUT A PIECE OF
    PACIFIC ROCK COD...
OKAY.

350
00:14:34,925 --> 00:14:38,026
PER ORDER,
    AND THEN THE CRAB.

351
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:41,396
<i> NEXT UP, A LIGHT TOMATO SAUCE</i>
 <i> WITH AN UNEXPECTED SPICE.</i>

352
00:14:41,498 --> 00:14:44,198
THE KEY INGREDIENT TO OUR
CIOPPINO SAUCE IS CUMIN.

353
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:46,734
THAT'S KIND OF
OUR SIGNATURE THING.

354
00:14:46,836 --> 00:14:50,438
YOU WANT AN INCH
    OF SAUCE IN THERE.
RIGHT ON TOP?

355
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,941
RIGHT ON TOP.
     THAT'S GOOD.
ALL RIGHT.

356
00:14:53,043 --> 00:14:55,043
WE'RE GONNA PUT SAY 1/4 CUP,

357
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:57,345
MAYBE 1/3 OF A CUP

358
00:14:57,447 --> 00:14:59,247
OF CLAM JUICE.

359
00:14:59,349 --> 00:15:02,483
WE HAVE SOME WHITE WINE, WHICH
 WE'RE GONNA TWIRL IN THERE.

360
00:15:02,586 --> 00:15:04,953
ALL RIGHT, AND THEN WE JUST
 PUT THE LID ON IT.

361
00:15:05,055 --> 00:15:06,788
SO IT'S GONNA BE
A CROSS BETWEEN

362
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:09,424
SIMMERING IT IN THERE
 AND STEAMING IT?
       YES.

363
00:15:09,526 --> 00:15:12,427
WHEN DO WE KNOW
 IT'S READY?
   WHEN THE CLAMS ARE OPEN
   AND IT'S SIMMERING,

364
00:15:12,529 --> 00:15:14,062
IT'S DONE.
OKAY.

365
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:16,064
RIGHT THERE. PERFECT.

366
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,733
SO KIND OF GIVE IT THIS
   A LITTLE BIT HERE.
OH, OH, OH.

367
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:21,235
THE PIèCE de RéSISTANCE--

368
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:24,238
PUT A LITTLE BIT OF GREEN
   ON TOP FOR COLOR,

369
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:26,741
THEN THERE IT IS.

370
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:28,876
BON APPéTIT,
    AS THEY SAY, HUH?

371
00:15:28,979 --> 00:15:31,879
I'M GONNA GET DOWN
  ON IT.
     LET ME GIVE YOU
     A BIB, TOO.

372
00:15:31,982 --> 00:15:33,881
NO BIB.
    NO BIB?
  YOU'RE GOING UNPROTECTED?

373
00:15:33,984 --> 00:15:36,384
NO, I AM GONNA BE
IN IT TO WIN IT.
       YEAH.

374
00:15:36,486 --> 00:15:39,387
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS--
  THE MACHINE.
      I BET.
     OH, I CAN TELL.

375
00:15:39,489 --> 00:15:41,389
WE'LL DO THAT.

376
00:15:41,491 --> 00:15:43,458
I CAN TELL.
 CUCKOO!

377
00:15:48,131 --> 00:15:51,599
THAT WAS A GOOD BITE,
  WASN'T IT?
   OH, DUDE, DID YOU HEAR
  THE SLURPER ON THAT ONE?

378
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:53,601
OH, THIS IS SO GOOD.
THERE YOU GO.

379
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:56,604
LET ME SAY THIS,
  AND I DON'T SAY THIS OFTEN

380
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:59,107
'CAUSE I DON'T LIKE
     TO QUALIFY

381
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:01,109
THAT ANYTHING
  SPECIFICALLY IS THE BEST--

382
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:03,277
THAT MIGHT BE SOME OF
    THE BEST CIOPPINO

383
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,279
I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE.

384
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:08,783
I NEED A NAP
     AND A HOSE.

385
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:12,186
AND I DIDN'T GET
     ANY ON ME.

386
00:16:12,288 --> 00:16:14,689
<i> FOLKS DRIVE HOURS FOR THIS...</i>

387
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:17,892
SO WHICH PART IS YOUR FAVORITE
 PART OF THE CIOPPINO?
      THE CRAB.

388
00:16:17,994 --> 00:16:19,594
<i> AND EVERYTHING ELSE</i>
   <i> ON THE MENU--</i>

389
00:16:19,696 --> 00:16:22,296
<i> NOT JUST BECAUSE</i>
 <i> THE FOOD'S OFF THE HOOK,</i>

390
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,165
<i> BUT BECAUSE IT'S THE WAY</i>
  <i> THEY REMEMBER IT.</i>

391
00:16:24,267 --> 00:16:26,234
IT'S A FAMILY TRADITION
  THAT'S BEEN PASSED ON

392
00:16:26,336 --> 00:16:28,436
FOR GENERATIONS
  AND GENERATIONS.

393
00:16:28,538 --> 00:16:31,673
<i> AND THIS IS ONE OF THE FEW</i>
 <i> PLACES YOU CAN STILL GET</i>

394
00:16:31,775 --> 00:16:35,076
<i> A RARE CALIFORNIA SPECIALTY</i>
 <i> DONE RIGHT--A BIG, RICH,</i>

395
00:16:35,178 --> 00:16:38,246
<i> WEST COAST SHELLFISH CALLED</i>
 <i> ABALONE ON HOMEMADE SOURDOUGH.</i>

396
00:16:38,348 --> 00:16:40,014
SO LET'S MAKE ONE.
OKAY.

397
00:16:40,116 --> 00:16:43,017
WE GIVE IT AN EGG WASH,
GIVE IT A VERY LIGHT--
      LIGHT DUST?

398
00:16:43,119 --> 00:16:46,020
LIGHT DUSTING
OF CRACKER MEAL.
       OKAY.

399
00:16:46,122 --> 00:16:49,457
WE'LL DO THAT TO OUR--WE GET
TWO LITTLE CUTLETS PER SANDWICH.

400
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:52,493
WE'LL BRING IT
 OVER HERE.
  SO IT DOESN'T GET FRIED,
   IT GOES FLAT TOP?

401
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:55,663
IT GOES FLAT TOP GRILL.

402
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:58,733
SEE HOW IT'S STARTING TO GET
 GOLDEN BROWN RIGHT THERE?

403
00:16:58,835 --> 00:17:00,735
THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE LOOKIN' FOR.

404
00:17:00,837 --> 00:17:02,737
WE'RE DONE, SO WE GOT
THE SLICED SOURDOUGH.

405
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:04,706
PUT IT ON THERE
JUST LIKE THAT.

406
00:17:04,808 --> 00:17:06,708
NO LETTUCE,
   NO TOMATO, NO NADA--

407
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:08,643
DON'T INTERRUPT PERFECTION.
THAT'S RIGHT.

408
00:17:08,745 --> 00:17:10,645
OH, THAT IS SO KILLER.

409
00:17:10,747 --> 00:17:12,747
YEAH, IT'S A GOOD,
  HOT ITEM.

410
00:17:15,752 --> 00:17:18,653
MM.
  IF ANYBODY KNOWS ABALONE,

411
00:17:18,755 --> 00:17:22,023
THIS IS--
    THIS IS THE BOMB.

412
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,525
THAT IS SUCH A RICH--

413
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:27,028
I MEAN,
   THE FLAVOR'S SO DEEP,

414
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:29,063
AND THE SEAWEED ADDS
    SOME TEXTURE--OH.

415
00:17:29,165 --> 00:17:31,432
TEXTURE OF THE BREAD--
     JUST DON'T TALK
     DURING THIS.

416
00:17:31,534 --> 00:17:34,836
SEAFOOD IS THE BEST.
  <i> BUT IT ISN'T JUST</i>
   <i> THE SEAFOOD.</i>

417
00:17:34,938 --> 00:17:37,438
<i> WHEN WE COME BACK,</i>
 <i> HERE IN ARTICHOKE COUNTRY,</i>

418
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:40,308
<i>DUARTE'S IS GROWIN' THEIR OWN--</i>
 <i> WAIT TILL YOU SEE WHAT FOR.</i>

419
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:43,411
MM. WOW, THAT IS GOOD.

420
00:17:46,549 --> 00:17:49,450
<i> AT DUARTE'S TAVERN</i>
 <i> IS PESCADERO, CALIFORNIA,</i>

421
00:17:49,552 --> 00:17:52,153
<i> THEY'RE TOTALLY</i>
  <i> INTO LOCAL FLAVOR.</i>

422
00:17:52,255 --> 00:17:54,789
IT'S A FANTASTIC
   PLACE TO COME.
 <i> FRESH FROM THE PACIFIC,</i>

423
00:17:54,891 --> 00:17:58,025
<i>AND FROM THEIR OWN LITTLE PIECE</i>
 <i> OF LAND JUST DOWN THE STREET.</i>

424
00:17:58,128 --> 00:18:00,261
OH, YEAH.
WE'LL USE THAT, AND MAKE
ARTICHOKE SOUP OUT OF IT.

425
00:18:00,363 --> 00:18:02,930
THE ARTICHOKE SOUP--

426
00:18:03,032 --> 00:18:04,532
I CAN'T TELL YOU

427
00:18:04,634 --> 00:18:07,468
THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE THAT WILL
 JUST WALK IN THE DOOR AND SAY,

428
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:09,370
"IS THIS THE PLACE
  WITH THE ARTICHOKE SOUP?"

429
00:18:09,472 --> 00:18:11,205
IT'S OFF THE HOOK,
  BUDDY!

430
00:18:11,307 --> 00:18:14,642
IF WE GET HIM SOME SPIKED BLONDE
HAIR, HE COULD DOUBLE IN FOR ME.

431
00:18:14,744 --> 00:18:16,544
ALL RIGHT, SO TALK
   TO ME ABOUT THE SOUP.

432
00:18:16,646 --> 00:18:19,781
HOW DO WE START THIS?
WE START WITH WHOLE BUTTER,
  CHICKEN BROTH.

433
00:18:19,883 --> 00:18:22,917
CHICKEN BOUILLON TO GIVE IT
 A LITTLE MORE INTENSE FLAVOR.

434
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:25,920
OKAY, SO THESE
    ARE THE ARTICHOKES.
 THESE ARE COOKED
WITH SALT, PEPPER,

435
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:28,923
A LITTLE OIL AND GARLIC.
THEY SHOULD BE SOMEWHAT FIRM...

436
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:31,092
OH, DELICIOUS!
'CAUSE WE DON'T WANT
 TO OVERCOOK 'EM.

437
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:31,526
THREE HANDFULS.

438
00:18:34,464 --> 00:18:37,365
COOL. I'LL BE OVER HERE.
  THIS IS OUR OLD BLENDER.
    COME HERE, GUY.
THREE HANDFULS.

439
00:18:37,467 --> 00:18:40,368
NO, NO, NO, NO.
    THIS IS HIGH TECH.

440
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:43,838
OKAY, THAT'S WHAT WE DO.
 SOUNDS LIKE IT'S
ABOUT READY TO LAUNCH.

441
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:47,508
NOW WE ADD IT TO THE POT.
NOW IS IT SUPPOSED TO HAVE
  A LITTLE CHUNK?

442
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:50,511
YOU DON'T WANNA COMPLETELY
 PURéE IT AND LIQUEFY IT.
    'CAUSE YOU WANT IT
   TO HAVE SOME TEXTURE.

443
00:18:50,613 --> 00:18:52,613
YOU GOTTA HAVE
THE TEXTURE IN THERE.

444
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:55,016
I'M GONNA PUT SALT,
PEPPER AND GARLIC IN IT...
       OKAY.

445
00:18:55,118 --> 00:18:57,018
AND THEN SIMMER IT,
   AND AT THE VERY END,

446
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,020
WE'LL PUT THE CREAM IN--
   WHOLE WHIPPING CREAM.

447
00:18:59,122 --> 00:19:00,655
THAT'S THE END
   OF THE ARTICHOKE SOUP.

448
00:19:00,757 --> 00:19:02,657
THAT'S HOW YOUR DAD
WAS DOING IT BACK--

449
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:05,359
IT'S BEEN THE SAME RECIPE--
BACK IN THE 1960s.

450
00:19:05,461 --> 00:19:07,361
THAT'S RIGHT.
    IS THAT A SHOVEL?

451
00:19:07,463 --> 00:19:09,697
YEAH, WELL, ONLY FOR PEOPLE
  WITH BIG MOUTHS.

452
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:11,332
OH, YEAH, YEAH.

453
00:19:13,837 --> 00:19:16,671
THAT'S FANTASTIC.
  THAT'S NICE AND VELVETY.

454
00:19:16,773 --> 00:19:18,606
OH, IT'S REALLY GOOD, MAN.

455
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:20,942
GREAT.
SIGNATURE ITEM.

456
00:19:21,044 --> 00:19:23,945
I NOW LIVE ON THE EAST COAST,
 SO I HAVE TO GET BACK HERE

457
00:19:24,047 --> 00:19:26,714
FOR MY ARTICHOKE SOUP
  AS OFTEN AS POSSIBLE.

458
00:19:26,816 --> 00:19:29,450
WHAT'S NEXT?

459
00:19:29,552 --> 00:19:31,719
WHAT DO WE EAT NOW?
   THE DESSERTS
   ARE GREAT.

460
00:19:31,821 --> 00:19:33,588
THE OLOLLIEBERRY PIES
   ARE FANTASTIC.

461
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:36,624
<i> THE WHAT BERRY?</i>
OLOLLIEBERRY PIE
à LA MODE.

462
00:19:36,726 --> 00:19:39,227
<i> OLOLLIEBERRIES ARE FOUND</i>
 <i> MOSTLY IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA.</i>

463
00:19:39,329 --> 00:19:41,762
<i> THEY TASTE KIND OF LIKE</i>
 <i> BLACKBERRIES, BUT SWEETER,</i>

464
00:19:41,865 --> 00:19:44,432
<i> AND THEY MAKE A RIGHTEOUS</i>
   <i> HOMEMADE PIE.</i>

465
00:19:44,534 --> 00:19:46,500
THAT'S WHAT MAKES
    THIS PLACE SPECIAL.

466
00:19:46,603 --> 00:19:49,503
OH.
OH, ISN'T THAT AWESOME?

467
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:52,874
HAVE YOU DIED
AND GONE TO HEAVEN YET?

468
00:19:52,976 --> 00:19:56,043
OH, IF I DID, I'D BE THERE
  IN A BOWL OF CIOPPINO.

469
00:19:56,145 --> 00:19:59,213
OH, THIS IS SO GOOD.
  <i> BUT THERE'S ALSO</i>
  <i> THE ABALONE SANDWICH</i>

470
00:19:59,315 --> 00:20:01,582
<i> AND THE ARTICHOKE SOUP.</i>
OH, AND I'LL TAKE

471
00:20:01,684 --> 00:20:03,918
SOME OF THE SOUP
 AND THE PIE HOME AS WELL.

472
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:07,154
<i> AND ALL OF THE OTHER LOCAL</i>
 <i> FLAVORS THAT KEEP FOLKS</i>

473
00:20:07,257 --> 00:20:10,358
<i> PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS PLACE</i>
  <i> DECADE AFTER DECADE.</i>

474
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,860
SO WHEN--

475
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:14,362
HEY!

476
00:20:14,464 --> 00:20:17,098
YOU CAN'T HAVE YOUR ARM
 IN A SLING WHEN YOU'RE WORKIN'.

477
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,600
WELL, THAT'S IT FOR THIS TRIP,
  BUT DON'T WORRY,

478
00:20:19,702 --> 00:20:21,602
I'LL BE LOOKIN' FOR YOU

479
00:20:21,704 --> 00:20:23,938
AT AMERICA'S GREATEST DINERS,
  DRIVE-INS AND DIVES.

480
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,440
AND THEN NOW PUT
  THE CELL PHONES IN, RIGHT?

481
00:20:26,542 --> 00:20:28,943
THAT'S WHEN WE ADD
   THOSE TASTY MORSELS.

482
00:20:29,045 --> 00:20:31,812
I DON'T KNOW--
I DON'T KNOW WHO'S THOSE ARE.

483
00:20:31,915 --> 00:20:33,948
IT SAYS, "PAROLE OFFICER,"
   SO I DON'T KNOW...

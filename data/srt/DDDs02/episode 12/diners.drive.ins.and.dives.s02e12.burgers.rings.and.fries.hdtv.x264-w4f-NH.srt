00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:22,121
PUSH IT DOWN.
 I ALSO PICK UP
THE VINEGAR FLAVOR.

10
00:00:22,223 --> 00:00:25,157
<i> IN SAN FRANCISCO, A PLACE</i>
 <i> THAT'S DOING STEAK BURGERS</i>

00:00:25,259 --> 00:00:27,626
<i> WHILE YOU WATCH.</i>

<i> SHE'S GOING FOR 21.</i>
ARE YOU REALLY GONNA
BE ABLE TO DO 21?

19
00:00:41,842 --> 00:00:43,642
OH, FOR SURE.
 <i> AND THEY'VE GOT ONION RINGS</i>

26
00:01:03,097 --> 00:01:05,497
I REALLY LIKE TO GET MY HANDS
 ON WHAT THE LOCALS LIKE TO EAT.

27
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:07,166
NOW UP HERE
   IN MINNESOTA,

28
00:01:07,268 --> 00:01:08,934
IT'S NOT FRIED PICKLES
   OR CARNITAS,

29
00:01:09,036 --> 00:01:11,370
IT'S WHAT THEY CALL
  "STUFFED BURGERS,"

30
00:01:11,472 --> 00:01:14,806
AND ONE OF THE BEST IS AT THIS
 JOINT--THE NOOK IN ST. PAUL.

31
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:17,443
LOOK AT ALL THAT
  CHEESE GOOIN' OUT OF HERE.

32
00:01:17,545 --> 00:01:20,813
GOOIN' OUT.
   IT'S THAT MELTED,   GOOEY CHEESE INSIDE.

33
00:01:20,915 --> 00:01:23,449
ALEXI, YOU'RE UP.

34
00:01:23,551 --> 00:01:25,684
AND IT'S FANTASTIC,
 AND IT'S HORRIBLY MESSY.

35
00:01:25,786 --> 00:01:27,686
<i> IT'S THE SPECIALTY</i>
  <i> HERE AT THE NOOK.</i>

36
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:29,655
<i> THEY CALL IT</i>
  <i> "THE JUICY NOOKIE."</i>

37
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:31,657
SO HOW IS NOOKIE
     AT LUNCH?

38
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,393
IT'S REALLY GOOD.
       REALLY?

39
00:01:34,495 --> 00:01:36,028
BUT THIS IS THE BEST ONE
   I'VE EVER HAD.

40
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:39,398
<i> AND THEY'VE BEEN DOING KILLER</i>
 <i> BURGERS HERE FOR DECADES.</i>

41
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,333
THIS PLACE WAS  HERE SINCE...
       1938, YEAH.

42
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:45,070
EWIN RTAURANT BIZ.

43
00:01:45,172 --> 00:01:47,306
WE'VE BEEN WORKING
   AT IT SINCE, WHAT, 14?

44
00:01:47,408 --> 00:01:49,274
ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE UP!
 <i> BUT RUNNING THEIR OWN JOINT</i>

45
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:51,076
<i> WAS SOMETHIN' ELSE.</i>

46
00:01:51,178 --> 00:01:53,011
WHEN WE TOOK OVER THIS PLACE,
  WE WERE 20 YEARS OLD.

47
00:01:53,114 --> 00:01:54,680
I MEAN, WE WERE
     REAL YOUNG.

48
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:57,049
<i> AND SMART ENOUGH</i>
  <i> TO ASK FOR HELP</i>

49
00:01:57,151 --> 00:01:59,751
<i> FROM A FORMER OWNER FROM A FEW</i>
 <i> YEARS BACK--MICKEY BROWNSON.</i>

50
00:01:59,854 --> 00:02:02,254
SHE KNEW OUR FATHERS.
  WE HAD HER COME BACK

51
00:02:02,356 --> 00:02:04,623
AND TEACH US
  HOW SHE USED TO DO IT.
      REALLY?
     SMART THINKIN'.

52
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:06,525
<i> AND THAT'S STILL</i>
  <i> HOW THEY DO IT...</i>

53
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:08,260
A BACON CHEESEBURGER.

54
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:10,629
<i> SEVEN YEARS LATER.</i>
ALEXI, YOU'RE UP!

55
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:13,398
WE CALL IT THE HOLY TRINITY
   OF BURGERS.

56
00:02:13,501 --> 00:02:15,601
WE HAVE FRESH BEEF,
  VERY FRESH BUNS DAILY.
     WE ORDER IT IN.

57
00:02:15,703 --> 00:02:17,302
FRESH FRIES
   THAT WE CUT.
   FRESH, FRESH, FRESH.

58
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:19,738
SO THE JUICY NOOKIE--

59
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,407
IT'S CHEESE FOLDED IN HALF

60
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,376
AND YOU FOLD IT AROUND.
A LITTLE SEASONING.

61
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:26,178
AND THIS IS YOUR OWN
SECRET BLEND OF SPICES?

62
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,214
IT'S VERY SECRET.
PRETTY MUCH.

63
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:31,083
WITH SUCH PRECISION.

64
00:02:31,185 --> 00:02:32,985
THEN WE POKE IT. YOU GOTTA
 LET THE CHEESE COME OUT,

65
00:02:33,087 --> 00:02:34,486
OTHERWISE IT'LL FIND
 IT'S OWN WAY OUT.

66
00:02:34,588 --> 00:02:36,722
SO IF YOU DON'T,
   IT'LL HAVE A BLOWOUT.
YEP.

67
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:39,258
YOU DON'T EVER MAKE THE HAMSTER
  NOISE WHEN YOU DO THAT?

68
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,959
LOOK AT THAT.

69
00:02:43,564 --> 00:02:44,763
THAT IS JUICY.

70
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:48,133
DUDE, I'M TELLIN' YA,
THAT'S A TASTY BURGER.

71
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:50,903
IS THIS
THE NUMBER ONE SELLER?
  THAT IS THE NUMBER ONE
   SELLER, YEP.

72
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:53,272
<i> BUT IT'S NOT THE ONLY ONE</i>
 <i> WITH CHEESE ON THE INSIDE.</i>

73
00:02:53,374 --> 00:02:55,274
<i> THIS ONE--</i>
 <i> STUFFED WITH PEPPERED JACK.</i>

74
00:02:55,376 --> 00:02:58,610
NOW THAT LOOKS LIKE
A CHUNK OF CHEESE.

75
00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:01,446
SQUEEZE.
   IT'S A WORKOUT.

76
00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:02,681
YOU READY?

77
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:05,117
OH, I'M IN IT
    TO WIN IT, BABY.
  OH, YEAH, BABY.

78
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:07,085
LOOK AT THAT THING.

79
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,257
OH, YEAH. DUDE...

80
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:15,627
A CHEESE EXPLOSION. MMM.

81
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:18,096
YOU KNOW WHAT I'LL SAY
 I LIKE ABOUT THAT?
   WHAT'S THAT?

82
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:19,097
EVERYTHING.
    COOL.

83
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,099
BUT THE BUN
IS FANTASTIC.

84
00:03:21,202 --> 00:03:22,768
UNBELIEVABLE, ISN'T IT?

85
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,603
<i> AND WHY NOT?</i>
SO WHICH WAY?

86
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:26,638
<i> THEY'RE MAKING 'EM FRESH</i>
  <i> RIGHT DOWN THE STREET.</i>

87

WHOA.

88
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:31,176
LOOK AT THAT--AND THEN
 A LITTLE EGG WASH BRUSH ON TOP?

89
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:33,178
THOSE LOOK FANTASTIC.

90
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,348
MMM. IT'S LIGHT.
 DOES HAVE A LITTLE SWEETNESS.

91
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,750
WRAP THOSE TO GO.
NO PROBLEM.

92
00:03:38,852 --> 00:03:41,253
THANK YOU.
  <i> THEY'LL SERVE MORE</i>
 <i> THAN 1,000 EVERY WEEK--</i>

93
00:03:41,355 --> 00:03:43,956
<i> A NEW BATCH FRESH-MADE DAILY,</i>

94
00:03:44,058 --> 00:03:47,292
<i> JUST LIKE THEIR FRIES.</i>
WE'LL CUT ABOUT 6
50-POUND BOXES A DAY.

95
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,528
300 POUNDS OF POTATOES?
A DAY.

96
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:52,898
PUSH IT DOWN. 5% EXTRA WORK
 MAKES 100% DIFFERENCE.

97
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,401
<i> AND CHECK OUT</i>
  <i> THIS DIFFERENCE.</i>
GIVE ABOUT THREE GLUGS.

98
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:58,070
<i> THEY'RE SOAKING</i>
  <i> THE CUT POTATOES</i>

99
00:03:58,172 --> 00:03:59,905
<i> OVERNIGHT IN WATER</i>
  <i> SPIKED WITH VINEGAR--</i>

100
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:02,074
<i> A TRICK PASSED DOWN</i>
  <i> FROM THE FORMER OWNER.</i>

101
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:04,409
AND WHY THE GLUGS
     OF VINEGAR?
 IT KEEPS
THE FRIES CRISP.

102
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:10,115
I JUST LIKE THAT YOU HAVE
 THE SKIN ON 'EM.

103
00:04:10,217 --> 00:04:12,718
THEY GOT A NICE
 CRUNCH TO 'EM, NOT SUPER OILY.

104
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,853
I ALSO PICK UP
THE VINEGAR FLAVOR.

105
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:17,889
TASTY FRIES, MAN.
  ALWAYS THE FRIES.
  DEFINITELY THE FRIES,

106
00:04:17,992 --> 00:04:22,194
BUT THE BURGERS ARE GREAT.
    SCOOP UP THE CHEESE
    WITH THE FRIES.

107
00:04:22,296 --> 00:04:24,196
DELICIOUS.

108
00:04:24,298 --> 00:04:26,865
<i> AND IF YOU DON'T WANT YOUR</i>
  <i> CHEESE IN THE MIDDLE,</i>

109
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:28,300

  <i> OF OTHER OPTIONS.</i>

110
00:04:28,402 --> 00:04:30,135

    OH, I LIKE THAT.

111
00:04:30,237 --> 00:04:32,971
I LIKE THE LITTLE
  CRUST ON THAT. LOOKS GOOD.

112
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:34,439
NOW FRESH-COOKED
      BACON--

113
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:36,808
AND WHAT I LIKE IS THAT YOU'RE
 COOKING IT ON THE FLAT TOP,

114
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,877
SO YOU'RE GETTING
   A LITTLE BIT OF THAT--

115
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:41,446
EVERY MORNING WE COOK BACON
 ON THE GRIDDLE TO GET IT READY.

116
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:44,149
JUST KINDA SEASON THE GRILL?
  NOW WHAT IS THAT MAYO?

117
00:04:44,251 --> 00:04:46,351

LOT OF PEPPER.

124
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:08,040
NOW WE PUT THE CHEESE
 ON THE BOTTOM OF OUR BURGERS,

125
00:05:08,142 --> 00:05:11,043
UNLIKE MOST PLACES, 'CAUSE
THAT'S WHERE THE TASTE BUDS ARE.

NO, IT'S WHAT MICKEY
  TAUGHT US.

128
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,750
SHE SAID WE HAD TO DO IT,
AND WE JUST KEPT DOING IT.

129
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:20,919

I LIKED 'EM ALL.

138
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,412
I THINK THE JUICY NOOKIE
  IS MY FAVORITE

139
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,881
BECAUSE OF THE CHEESE
  INSIDE.

140
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:53,452
I DON'T THINK IT'S JUST
FOR BREAKFAST ANYMORE EITHER.
     IT'S COMIN' UP.

141
00:05:53,554 --> 00:05:55,454
NOW HAVE YOU BEEN
COMING HERE FOR A WHILE?

142
00:05:55,556 --> 00:05:57,456
JUST NOD TO YOUR QUESTIONS.
   UM-HMM.

143
00:05:57,558 --> 00:05:59,458
FOR FIVE YEARS?
FIVE MONTHS? FIVE DAYS?

144
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,094
YEARS? FIVE YEARS.

145
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:04,529
WE LOVE IT BECAUSE
 IT'S A NEIGHBORHOOD PLACE,

146
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:07,466
AND IT'S NOT A CHAIN,
  AND THE FOOD'S AWESOME.

147
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:09,568
ALL RIGHT.
    HOLE-IN-THE-WALL
     ATMOSPHERE.

148
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,570
AND THE YOUNG GUYS
  THAT KINDA OPENED IT UP.

149
00:06:11,672 --> 00:06:13,405
YOU'D LIKE TO SEE
SUPPORTING THEM.
       YEAH.

150
00:06:13,507 --> 00:06:16,308
WERE YOU GUYS BEST BUDDIES
 BEFORE THIS STARTED?

151
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,143
OLDEST BUDDIES. THERE'S
 A PICTURE OF US IN OUR DIAPERS.

152
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:21,146
<i> AND JUST A FEW YEARS LATER,</i>
 <i> THEY'RE STILL SIDE BY SIDE.</i>

153
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:23,415
ARE YOU GUYS STILL
AS TIGHT AS YOU WERE?

154
00:06:23,517 --> 00:06:25,417
I THINK WE'RE
    TIGHTER ACTUALLY.
REALLY?

155
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:28,420
WE BUTT HEADS I THINK FOR
  THE FIRST COUPLE OF YEARS.

156
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:31,423
FIRST COUPLE YEARS,
 HE COULDN'T DO ANYTHING RIGHT.

157
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:34,659
I FINALLY TRAINED HIM IN,
 SO NOW WE'RE DOING ALL RIGHT.

158
00:06:34,762 --> 00:06:36,628
<i> LOVE TO WORK...</i>
GINA, YOU'RE UP!

159
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,764
<i>THESE DAYS THEY'RE CRANKING OUT</i>
  <i> THE JUICY NOOKIES...</i>

160
00:06:38,866 --> 00:06:41,366
IT'S JUST ALL-AROUND
     DELICIOUS.
  <i> DOUBLE-DECKER BURGERS</i>

161
00:06:41,468 --> 00:06:44,102
<i> AND THE HOME-CUT FRIES.</i>
ALEXI, YOU'RE UP!

162
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:46,471
JUICY, NO ONION.
 <i> AND THE JOINT'S AS BUSY</i>
   <i> AS IT'S BEEN</i>

163
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:48,106
<i> IN ALMOST 70 YEARS.</i>

164
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,975
FOLLOW THE COIN...

165
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:57,048
WHERE'S MY WALLET?

166
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:01,653
<i> UP NEXT, WE'RE HEADING</i>
   <i> TO SAN FRAN,</i>

167
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:04,356
<i> WHERE THEY'RE DEAD SERIOUS</i>
 <i> ABOUT BURGERS FROM SCRATCH.</i>

168
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,425
IF I DON'T EAT IT,
  I WON'T SERVE IT.

169
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:13,165
ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL,
  BUT NOT ALL BURGERS,

170
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:15,467
AND THIS BRINGS US
  TO JOE'S CABLE CAR

171
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:18,103
IN SAN FRANCISCO, AT THE CORNER
  OF SILVER AND MISSION,

172
00:07:18,205 --> 00:07:20,105
WHERE THIS DUDE'S BEEN KNOCKING
  IT OUT OF THE PARK

173
00:07:20,207 --> 00:07:23,108
FOR OVER 40 YEARS WITH SOMETHING
 YOU AND I WOULD CALL A BURGER,

174
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:26,711
BUT HE INSISTS IT'S FRESH
   GROUND STEAK.

175
00:07:26,814 --> 00:07:30,115
I MEAN, LOOK AT IT. IT'S
 JUICY. IT MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH.

176
00:07:30,217 --> 00:07:32,050
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
    YOU GOTTA EAT IT.

177
00:07:32,152 --> 00:07:34,219
IT HAS A UNIQUE TASTE.
   IT WAS GREAT.

178
00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:38,390
EVERYTHING WAS FRESH.
  <i> BIG, THICK AND JUICY,</i>

179
00:07:38,492 --> 00:07:40,392
<i> TOPPED WITH</i>
  <i> JUST ABOUT ANYTHING.</i>

180
00:07:40,494 --> 00:07:43,562
I GOT MINE WITH AN EGG.
    IT'S GREAT.
 THERE'S REALLY GOOD
 VARIETY HERE.

181
00:07:43,664 --> 00:07:45,797
THE BEST BURGER I THINK
  I'VE EVER TASTED.

182
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:48,867
MUSHROOMS
    AND SWISS CHEESE.
  <i> THEY'VE GOT 11</i>
  <i> DIFFERENT CHEESES,</i>

183
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,936
<i> 3 DIFFERENT SIZES--</i>
   <i> A 4-OUNCE,</i>

184
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:52,671
<i> A 6-OUNCE AND A RIGHTEOUS</i>
   <i> 8-OUNCE.</i>

185
00:07:52,773 --> 00:07:55,173
YOU GONNA BE ABLE
TO FINISH ALL THAT?
   I DON'T KNOW.

186
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:58,076
IF YOU DON'T, CALL ME.
 I'LL COME BACK.
     I'M STUFFED.

187
00:07:58,178 --> 00:07:59,711
THIS IS THE BEST BURGER
 IN SAN FRANCISCO.

188
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:02,447
<i> AND IT'S THIS GUY'S PASSION.</i>

189
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:04,883
I KNOW WHAT THE BURGER
    IS MADE OF.
  LOOK AT THAT THING.

190
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:07,319
I GOT A PATTY MELT.
  <i> ARMENIAN NATIVE</i>
   <i> JOE OBEGI</i>

191
00:08:07,421 --> 00:08:10,622
<i> CAME TO AMERICA IN '62,</i>
  <i> AND EVER SINCE,</i>

192
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:12,624
<i> HE'S BEEN MAKING</i>
 <i> THE ALL-AMERICAN BURGER.</i>

193
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:15,160
BASICALLY, IF I DON'T EAT IT,
   I WON'T SERVE IT.

194
00:08:15,262 --> 00:08:18,063
<i> HE BOUGHT THE PLACE 42 YEARS</i>
 <i> AGO, AND HE'S HERE SO MUCH,</i>

195
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:20,599
<i> IT FEELS LIKE HOME.</i>
YOU'RE WELCOME.

196
00:08:20,701 --> 00:08:23,768
THE NEON, THE LIGHTS--IT'S LIKE,
 "WELCOME TO LITTLE VEGAS."

197
00:08:23,871 --> 00:08:26,471
WHAT IS THE THEME?
JUST MAKE IT CHEERFUL.

198
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:29,341
OH, IT IS CHEERFUL.
CHEERS ME UP
 EVERY DAY.

199
00:08:29,443 --> 00:08:31,209
HOLY NEON-O-RAMA.

200
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:33,812
"WELCOME TO JOE'S."
"WELCOME TO JOE'S
ADDICTIVE BURGERS."

201
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:35,814
NOW ARE YOU ALWAYS
 IN THE DINING ROOM DOING THIS--

202
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,816
WALKING AROUND,
  TALKING TO PEOPLE?
SIX DAYS A WEEK.

203
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:39,684
SIX DAYS A WEEK?
SIX, SEVEN DAYS, YEAH.

204
00:08:39,786 --> 00:08:42,020
THE CALIFORNIA. AND HOW
  WOULD YOU LIKE IT COOKED?

205
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:45,323
TODAY I HAD
THE TERIYAKI BURGER.
   I GOT THE PIZZA BURGER.

206
00:08:45,425 --> 00:08:47,759
I GOT A PATTY MELT.
    THEY'RE AMAZING.
 I DO NOT
ADD ANYTHING.

207
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:50,395
I TAKE IT THE WAY
 JOE SERVES IT.
  CHEDDAR,
 CHEDDAR, CHEDDAR.

208
00:08:50,497 --> 00:08:52,631
IT'S JUST A REALLY
  DELICIOUS BURGER.

209
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:55,700
EVERYBODY HAPPY?
 THE MEAT
IS THE STAR.

210
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:57,602
<i> AND TO MAKE IT RIGHT,</i>
   <i> HE INSISTS</i>

211
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:01,706
<i> IT'S ALL ABOUT CUTTING IT</i>
 <i> FRESH--TOP-GRADE CHOICE BEEF.</i>

212
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:03,708
I DON'T LIKE TO USE
    THE WORD "BURGER,"

213
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:06,545
BECAUSE THEN IT MESSES
   EVERYBODY'S BRAIN.

214
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:08,914
IT'S JUICY.
  REAL GROUND BEEF.

215
00:09:09,016 --> 00:09:11,683
<i> AND IT'S TRIMMED</i>
 <i> AND GROUND FRESH EVERY DAY,</i>

216
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:13,985
<i> - RIGHT IN THE RESTAURANT.
- </i> SEEING THAT GUY OVER THERE

217
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:16,121
WITH THAT LITTLE HOOK
 AND THAT KNIFE,

218
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:17,956
JUST CARVING,

219
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:20,492
AND THEN IT GOES
RIGHT INTO THAT GRINDER

220
00:09:20,594 --> 00:09:22,694
AND PLOPS RIGHT
ONTO THAT GRILL.

221
00:09:22,796 --> 00:09:24,396
THEY'RE ALL CHUCK ROLLS.
THEY'RE ALL CHUCK ROLLS.

222
00:09:24,498 --> 00:09:26,097
READY?
GO.

223
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:29,401
WHAT FAT RATIO ARE WE
TRYING TO GET--FAT TO MEAT?

224
00:09:29,503 --> 00:09:32,571
BY THE TIME WE COOK IT,
 YOU END UP WITH 6% TO 8% FAT.

225
00:09:32,673 --> 00:09:34,406
SO YOU'RE GETTING--

226
00:09:34,508 --> 00:09:36,374
CONTRARY TO THE BELIEF
  THAT 80-20

227
00:09:36,476 --> 00:09:39,444
IS THE PREMIUM GRIND
 FOR A BURGER--

228
00:09:39,546 --> 00:09:41,279
BUT IF YOU'RE USING
 THE BEST MEAT,

229
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:43,315
THEN YOU DON'T HAVE
TO WORRY ABOUT THAT FAT.
        NO.

230
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:44,849
OKAY, WELL,
LET'S GRIND.

231
00:09:44,952 --> 00:09:47,986
WHEN WE LOOK INSIDE THIS,
 WE REALLY GET MEAT.

232
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,988
WE GET ACTUAL
CHEWABLE PIECES OF MEAT,

233
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:55,193
NOT MASHED AND PROCESSED.
 I MEAN, YOU ACTUALLY--

234
00:09:55,295 --> 00:09:57,195
AND THAT'S WHY
   IT'S A STEAK BURGER,

235
00:09:57,297 --> 00:09:59,898
BECAUSE IT'S ACTUALLY GOT
 TEXTURE--MEAT TEXTURE TO IT.

236
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,934
AND WHEN YOU BITE INTO IT,
 YOU HAVE MORE FLAVOR,

237
00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:05,070
MORE JUICE.
  THE MEAT HAD FLAVOR.

238
00:10:05,172 --> 00:10:06,671
IT WAS SO FRESH.

239
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:10,041
IT DOESN'T TASTE LIKE YOU WONDER
  WHAT ELSE IS IN IT.

240
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:12,544
SO WHERE'S
    THE PATTY MACHINE?
THAT'S THE PATTY MACHINE.

241
00:10:12,646 --> 00:10:14,980
YOU'RE THE PATTY MACHINE.
   LET ME SEE THAT THING.
YEAH, OH.

242
00:10:15,082 --> 00:10:16,448
WOW.
NOW THE MAGIC STARTS.

243
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:20,051
THIS IS WHEN
    THE MAGIC HAPPENS?
YEAH.

244
00:10:20,153 --> 00:10:22,287
SO THAT'S HOW IT GETS MADE.
  WOW, THAT'S A LOT OF MEAT.

245
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:23,922
WE GOTTA FLATTEN THIS,
     RIGHT?
YEAH.

246
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:25,590
PRESS IT DOWN?

247
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:28,593
SHAPE IT UP.
   THAT'S IT--JUST GIVE
    IT A LITTLE LOVE?

248
00:10:28,695 --> 00:10:30,595
YEAH, AND THEN--
    WANT ME TO PRESS
     IT AGAIN?

249
00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:32,864
WHEN YOU GO LIKE THAT,
  THEN...

250
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,699
SO IT GETS IT
TIGHT TOGETHER.
     AND NOW
    JUST PICK IT UP?

251
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,968
THE WAX PAPER'S NOT EVEN BIG
   ENOUGH, JOE.

252
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,671
SECOND TIME IS WHEN I GIVE IT
  THE BIG SMACKDOWN.

253
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:41,773
YEAH, YOU PUT IT DOWN,
  AND...

254
00:10:43,777 --> 00:10:46,611
DID YOU DO THIS GAME?

255
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:49,347
ALL WE DO IS SALT...

256
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:52,350
WHAT DO WE DO NOW, SING?
 YOU SING,
YOU BLESS IT.

257
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:54,586
YOU BLESS IT?
YEAH!

258
00:10:54,688 --> 00:10:57,589
MOST PEOPLE GO LIKE THIS--
  OH, BLESS.

259
00:10:57,691 --> 00:10:59,324
I THINK THAT'S JUST WHEN THEY'RE
TRYING TO KEEP THEIR HANDS WARM.

260
00:10:59,426 --> 00:11:02,427
JOE, I'M READY
   TO FLIP WHEN YOU ARE.
YEAH, OKAY.

261
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:06,498
WATCH THIS.

262
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,601
- DON'T TRY THIS       AT HOME.
-  DON'T TRY IT.

263
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:15,273
OH.

264
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:18,877
THAT'S BANANAS.
    BANANAS IS GOOD.

265
00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:20,912
LOOK AT ALL THE JUICE.

266
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:22,914
CRISPY BACON.

267
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:25,183
LITTLE BIT OF THAT
   BITE FROM THAT ONION.

268
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:28,119
I LIKE THE TERIYAKI.
  THAT'S A LOT OF AVOCADO.

269
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:30,121
ANYTHING I'D DO
    WITH PIZZA SAUCE.

270
00:11:30,223 --> 00:11:32,624
NUMBER ONE...

271
00:11:32,726 --> 00:11:34,626
NUMBER TWO--

272
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:36,628
THE JOE.
    THE ONIONS INSIDE.

273
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:39,130
NUMBER THREE--
     THE PATTY MELT.
PATTY MELT?

274
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:41,866
OR MAYBE ONE, TWO, THREE.
 YEAH, THESE ARE MY TOP THREE.

275
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:44,869
OKAY, I'M GONNA
     GO TAKE A NAP.
 ALL RIGHT, LET ME
GET YOU YOUR BLANKET.

276
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:46,538
PLEASE. RIGHT HERE.
YEAH.

277
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,541
WHAT IS THE NUMBER ONE
  SELLER?
     THE BASIC ONE.

278
00:11:49,643 --> 00:11:52,010
<i> NEXT IS THE BACON BURGER,</i>
   <i> THEN MUSHROOM,</i>

279
00:11:52,112 --> 00:11:53,745
<i> PATTY MELT AND AVOCADO.</i>

280
00:11:53,847 --> 00:11:55,380

388
00:16:24,718 --> 00:16:27,385
THAT'S ONE OF OUR
BIGGEST EXPENSES

389
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:30,154
IS THE NAPKINS.
  <i> AND FOR SOME FOLKS,</i>
  <i> EVEN THESE BURGERS</i>

390
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:31,823
<i> ARE BETTER WITH</i>
 <i> SOMETHING FRIED ON THE SIDE.</i>

391
00:16:31,925 --> 00:16:34,726
YOU HAVE TO GET FRIES
  TO GO WITH YOUR BURGER,

392
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:37,395
JUST TO TOP IT OFF.
   <i> THEY'VE GOT</i>
 <i> DEEP-FRIED MUSHROOMS...</i>

393
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:40,765
DELICIOUS.
  <i> CAULIFLOWER, BROCCOLI</i>
   <i> AND ZUCCHINI.</i>

394
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:42,834
THE ZUCCHINI IS ONE
    OF MY FAVORITES.

395
00:16:42,936 --> 00:16:45,303
<i> AND THE ONION RINGS?</i>
THESE ARE THE BEST
ONION RINGS IN THE WORLD.

396
00:16:45,405 --> 00:16:47,238
<i>THEY TAKE THREE DAYS TO MAKE...</i>

397
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,673
OH, BEAUTY,
   BEAUTY, BEAUTY.

398
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:51,209
<i> THE FIRST TWO</i>
  <i> JUST TO DRY 'EM OUT,</i>

399
00:16:51,311 --> 00:16:53,478
<i> SO THE BATTER WILL STICK</i>
<i> THE WAY IT SHOULD.</i>
THE FIRST DAY
THE ONION COMES IN,

400
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:56,280
AND IT GETS THE SKIN
TAKEN OFF IT, THE ENDS CUT OFF,

401
00:16:56,383 --> 00:16:58,583
AND IT GETS THROWN IN A TUB
AND REFRIGERATED FOR A DAY.

402
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:01,886
SECOND DAY, IT GETS SLICED,
 PUT BACK IN THE BINS.

403
00:17:01,988 --> 00:17:04,355
ON THE THIRD DAY...
   DIPPED IN THE BATTER

404
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:06,090
AND THEN THROWN INTO BREADING

405
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:08,526
AND TAKEN OUT ON THE LINE
   AND SERVED THAT DAY.

406
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:10,328
SO I GUESS THIS SWEATING
 OF THE ONION IDEA

407
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,330
IS WHEN YOU COOK IT,
THE MOISTURE WOULD WANT

408
00:17:12,432 --> 00:17:15,500
TO EXPEL OUT OF THE ONION,
WHICH WOULD BLOW THE BATTER OFF.
      EXACTLY.

409
00:17:15,602 --> 00:17:18,669
MAN, I CANNOT BELIEVE HOW THAT
BATTER HOLDS ONTO THOSE RINGS.

410
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,240
I'M HAVIN', LIKE,
    A CRUNCH FEST.

411
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:24,242
THESE ONION RINGS,
     REALLY...

412
00:17:24,344 --> 00:17:27,245
ARE UP THERE
     IN ONION RINGS.

413
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:29,947
THANK YOU.
   I MEAN, YOU GUYS
  SHOULD BE PROUD OF THOSE.

414
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,649

415
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:36,054
<i> THE BIG SHOW</i>
<i> IS STILL THE BURGERS.</i>
DELICIOUS AND MESSY.

416
00:17:36,156 --> 00:17:38,089
LET'S SEE. THERE'S THE SINGLE,

YEP. MUSHROOMS, ONION,
    SWISS CHEESE.

420
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:49,100
I'LL JUST KEEP MY HANDS AND FEET
 INSIDE THE RIDE AT ALL TIMES.

421

OH, FOR SURE.

428
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:09,821

<i> WHEN WE COME BACK.</i>
WOW.

429
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:12,323
SHE STARTS OFF WITH A BIG BITE
 AND PICKS UP THE DROPPINGS.

430
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:14,092
THAT DIDN'T SOUND RIGHT.

 <i> THEIR OWN KIND OF BURGER</i>

435
00:18:24,404 --> 00:18:26,804

YOU DON'T COME TO

WITHOUT COMING TO BLIMPY'S.
    NEXT.

437
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:30,808
<i> AND YOU BETTER BE READY</i>

00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:42,186
THE BIGGEST ONE I EVER GOT
   WAS A QUAD.
 I USUALLY GET
A QUAD OR A QUINT.

442

BUT THE RECORD STANDS
AT A LITTLE OVER 4 POUNDS.

444
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:50,094
I SAW THAT THERE WAS A RECORD
 STANDING FOR CLOSE TO A DECADE,

445
00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:52,096
AND I SAID TO MYSELF,
   YOU KNOW WHAT?

446
00:18:52,198 --> 00:18:53,764
ONE OF THESE DAYS,
  I'M GONNA BREAK THAT,

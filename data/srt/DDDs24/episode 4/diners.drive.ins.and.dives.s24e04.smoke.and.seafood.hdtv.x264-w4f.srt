          little Worcestershire.

  Flavortown right there, buddy.

141

And we'll add celery,
and then we got chopped onions.

this is the seafood restaurant
I wanted to come to.

162
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:53,452
You can't hear the seagulls,
you don't see any boats,

163
00:05:53,454 --> 00:05:55,287
and you got a freeway
 in your front yard.

00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:28,720
          So, I'm here
     in Baltimore, Maryland,

177
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:31,289
     in a random parking lot
    to check out a food truck

178
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:32,924
      that's serving up --
         Wait a second.

     Don't get ahead of me.
           No, no, no.

   or something with Old Bay."

 No. It's not what you'd expect.

184
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,237
      I'm here to check out
   a funky, little food truck

185
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:47,506
        that's serving up
    some real-deal barbecue.

186
00:06:47,508 --> 00:06:49,975
   This is The Smoking Swine.

187
00:06:49,977 --> 00:06:52,978
        The Smoking Swine
   is a fantastic food truck.

188
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:56,148
   I wouldn't go anywhere else
   for barbecue in Baltimore.

189
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,949
Lone Star Brisket for Harley!

190
00:06:57,951 --> 00:06:59,584
     Slow-cooked for hours.

191
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:02,120
  Smoke fills the whole truck,
    and it smells delicious.

192
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:03,488
    There's nothing like it.

193
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,957
    FIERI: And there's no one
 quite like owner Drew Pumphrey,

194
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:08,660
      who found his passion
          in a present.

195
00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:11,263
My parents actually got me
a smoker as a Christmas gift.

196
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:13,999
And everything that I put in it
just worked really well,

197
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:16,535
 and I just kind of
took to it naturally.

198
00:07:16,537 --> 00:07:18,603
     Then, when his catering
      and barbecue parties

199
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:23,308
  started blowing up, he moved
to a full-on food truck in 2012.

200
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,377
                 So this is
             your Pork Emporium.

201
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:27,712
              Your Pork Palace.

              says, "PORKBOX".

204
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:36,688
East Carolina for John?

205
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:39,658
    East Carolina pulled pork
     sandwich is fantastic.

206
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:42,828
    It's tender. The coleslaw
    complements it very well.

207
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:45,096
    I always put a little bit
    of the sweet sauce on it.

208
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:47,032
          It's perfect.

209
00:07:47,034 --> 00:07:48,467
                 All right.
              Dry rub it, baby.

210
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:51,803
Cool. We use a little
  dark brown sugar,

211
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:55,540
chili powder, paprika,
    kosher salt,

212
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:58,143
and some butcher-grind
    black pepper.

213
00:07:58,145 --> 00:07:59,611
 Mix It up by hand.

214
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:02,180
  On to the pork butts, and what
     kind of butts are we using?

215
00:08:02,182 --> 00:08:04,616
I like to use a boneless
shoulder, or a boneless butt.

216
00:08:04,618 --> 00:08:06,251
       -Boneless? Really?
         -I go boneless.

217
00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:08,520
Why pay for something
you're not using? [ Laughs ]

  so of course I agree with him.

219
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,091
             Okay, so, dry rub.

220
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:14,526
     And it goes
right into the smoker.

221
00:08:14,528 --> 00:08:15,594
     What do we smoke them with?

222
00:08:15,596 --> 00:08:16,995
     For these,
we're using peachwood.

223
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:18,396
                 Peachwood.

224
00:08:18,398 --> 00:08:21,066
It gives it a flavor profile,
I think, that nobody else,

225
00:08:21,068 --> 00:08:22,734
at least around here,
really can compare with.

226
00:08:22,736 --> 00:08:24,269
But I just wanted to be
 a little different.

227
00:08:24,271 --> 00:08:25,537
                   I think
       you're a little different

228
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:26,938
   regardless of you using peach
                   or not.

229
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,106
     That's what
 my doctor told me.

There's also no crab.

253
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:17,656
So we're using some heavy mayo,
   white vinegar,

254
00:09:17,658 --> 00:09:20,292
  some white sugar,
    celery seed.

Then I just like to add a little
bit of chipotle powder in there.

   And a little bagged slaw mix,
 because you don't have slicers?

00:14:56,663 --> 00:14:59,530
 So, I'm about a half-hour south
          of Key Largo

406
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:00,865
 in an area known as Islamorada.

407
00:15:00,867 --> 00:15:02,533
         Now, the place
     has got a great story.

408
00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:04,535
   The dad wants his daughter
       to move back home,

409
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:05,904
  so he buys her a restaurant.

410
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:07,872
           No, Hunter.
  That's not happening for you.

411
00:15:07,874 --> 00:15:10,742
I'm here because they tell me if
 you catch it, they'll cook it.

412
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:14,012
     This is the Islamorada
          Shrimp Shack.

413
00:15:14,014 --> 00:15:15,346
        Shrimp and grits
         in the window!

414
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:17,382
      When you're traveling
    through the Florida Keys,

415
00:15:17,384 --> 00:15:18,983
        you have to stop
      at the Shrimp Shack.

416
00:15:18,985 --> 00:15:19,984
         Shrimp po' boy.

417
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:22,720
       You will get fresh,
        amazing seafood.

418
00:15:22,722 --> 00:15:25,757
     Blackened shrimp tacos
and a conch poor boy with fries.

419
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:27,225
       We can't get enough
          of the place.

420
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:29,294
         Jill just does
     such an excellent job.

421
00:15:29,296 --> 00:15:31,162
             FIERI:
  That's Keys native Jill Jahn,

422
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:33,564
         whose dad knew
the way to his daughter's heart.

423
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:37,902
I was working as a waitress
in Orlando for like nine months.

424
00:15:37,904 --> 00:15:39,971
The only time I've ever lived
  out of the Keys.

425
00:15:39,973 --> 00:15:42,607
And he was like, "What's it
gonna take to get you home?"

426
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:45,109
And I was like, "Well, I really
want to open a restaurant.

427
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:47,412
  I love to cook."
And he's like, "Let's do it."

428
00:15:47,414 --> 00:15:49,681
                     ♪

429
00:15:49,683 --> 00:15:51,382
      So she ran the joint
        with her parents

430
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:53,584
   as Squid Row for 12 years,

431
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:55,853
            then left
  to focus on raising her kids,

432
00:15:55,855 --> 00:15:57,555
  and her folks sold the place.

433
00:15:57,557 --> 00:15:59,023
        We need a Senator style.

434
00:15:59,025 --> 00:16:00,792
        But the business
        was in her blood,

435
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:04,028
           so in 2011,
   she got the same spot back

436
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,763
 and opened up the Shrimp Shack.

437
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:07,398
'Cause I really wanted
     to do this.

438
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,567
   -You still wanted to do it.
    -Had to do it for myself.

439
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:11,235
 And it's still a family affair,

440
00:16:11,237 --> 00:16:13,972
 because now her daughter Morgan
      helps run the place.

441
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:15,907
      You'll feel the love.
     These girls are great.

442
00:16:15,909 --> 00:16:17,642
      You feel like a local
        when you're here,

443
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:18,810
     whether you are or not.

444
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:20,445
  -An order of shrimp fritters.
           -Thank you.

445
00:16:20,447 --> 00:16:22,013
       The shrimp fritters
         are fantastic.

446
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:24,615
 Very little breading, it's just
 enough to hold it all together.

447
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:27,452
              MAN:
  The sauce is amazing homemade
 remoulade that she makes here.

448
00:16:27,454 --> 00:16:28,653
      It's an awesome dish.

449
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:30,688
  We got remoulade
 set up right here.

450
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:31,856
            Let's get into this.

451
00:16:31,858 --> 00:16:33,925
All right, so, we're gonna add
   our mayonnaise.

452
00:16:33,927 --> 00:16:36,961
               What? Feel like
    I'm on the aircraft carrier.

453
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:38,930
We're gonna add some
    horseradish,

454
00:16:38,932 --> 00:16:42,166
  Cajun seasoning,
  paprika, mustard,

455
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:43,401
         -fresh garlic.
             -Okay.

456
00:16:43,403 --> 00:16:45,803
We're gonna add a few dashes
of Shrimp Shack hot sauce.

457
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:48,139
  -You have your own hot sauce.
    -Have our own hot sauce.

458
00:16:48,141 --> 00:16:49,207
          You guys are too cool.

459
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:50,908
  Now we whisk it,
and it's ready to go.

460
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,677
 -Next up, we make the fritter?
              -Yep.

461
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:57,115
We're gonna add our vegetables,
so we're gonna do celery,

462
00:16:57,117 --> 00:17:00,251
    green pepper,
red pepper, one onion.

463
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:01,519
I'm gonna add my shrimp.

464
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:03,988
-De-veined, shelled, chopped up.
         -Shelled, yep.

465
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,356
Chopped not super fine,

466
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:08,026
'cause I like a nice chunk
of shrimp in each bite.

467
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:10,628
For leavening, we're gonna add
baking powder to the flour.

468
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,864
I'm gonna do a little salt,
   pepper, garlic.

469
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:14,365
 Get it seasoned up.

470
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:15,967
                    Okay.
     You want this incorporated?

471
00:17:15,969 --> 00:17:18,836
Yeah, please. I'm gonna add
the egg while you're doing that.

472
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:20,338
     -As the binder, got it.
           -All right.

473
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,407
Then we're gonna add
 the flour mixture.

474
00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:24,909
    I like that you got a lot of
product here and a little flour.

475
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:26,644
And we got a little bit
    of hot sauce.

476
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:28,846
           Okay, so now we start
               to ball it up?

477
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:30,782
Yep. Put them in the fryer --

478
00:17:30,784 --> 00:17:33,384
     350 degrees
for four to five minutes.

479
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,319
            And that gets served
             with the remoulade.

480
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:36,687
              -Yep.
             -Okay.

481
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:40,091
                     ♪

482
00:17:40,093 --> 00:17:43,628
                   That is
        just the right amount --

483
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:45,129
           just the right amount
                  of flour.

484
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:46,964
             You definitely got
             the shrimp flavor.

485
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:48,466
      All those crunchy veggies.

486
00:17:48,468 --> 00:17:50,168
              The perfect size.

487
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:52,637
           Tender in the middle,
         crunchy on the outside,

488
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:55,807
           a little bit of spice
              in the remoulade.

489
00:17:55,809 --> 00:17:57,708
            If I come to a place
        called the Shrimp Shack,

490
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:00,545
     they make a shrimp fritter,
      it better taste like that.

491
00:18:00,547 --> 00:18:02,547
      Awesome.

492
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:04,082
           -Well done!
           -Thank you.

493
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:05,483
         Got two orders
       of shrimp fritters!

494
00:18:05,485 --> 00:18:06,717
   They're loaded with shrimp.

495
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,753
   Even though they're fried,
       they're not greasy.

496
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:09,854
     The sauce is excellent.

497
00:18:09,856 --> 00:18:11,122
        Fish continental.

498
00:18:11,124 --> 00:18:12,990
       WOMAN: Even though
  it's called the Shrimp Shack,

499
00:18:12,992 --> 00:18:16,427
   it's known for just putting
  fresh seafood on your plate.

500
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:18,129
             FIERI:
    Or what you're catching.

501
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:20,264
 Well, hook and cook is awesome,
     'cause you can go out,

502
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:22,033
        catch some fish,
   bring it to the restaurant.

503
00:18:22,035 --> 00:18:23,301
  Be able to have them cook it.

504
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:25,203
   There's many different ways
      that you can get it.

505
00:18:25,205 --> 00:18:28,506
It's always good to eat the fish
    that you know you caught.

506
00:18:28,508 --> 00:18:30,641
     Straight from the hook
to the table. It's hard to beat.

507
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:33,211
      They can just come in here
  and say, "I want it blackened.

508
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:35,279
             I want it grilled.
          I want it pan sautéed.

509
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:36,414
          I want it deep fried."

510
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:37,849
      -Whatever they want.
      -Every day, all day.

511
00:18:37,851 --> 00:18:40,118
     Regardless to which way
 you get it, you can't go wrong.

512
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,686
What did you bring me today?

513
00:18:41,688 --> 00:18:44,122
      A little mangrove snapper.

514
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:45,323
        Nice.

515
00:18:45,325 --> 00:18:47,091
   -Do you know Captain Tony?
        -Tony's awesome.

516
00:18:47,093 --> 00:18:48,426
               He filleted it.
               He cleaned it.

517
00:18:48,428 --> 00:18:50,928
 How do you want it?

518
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,296
            -Cooked.
       -How about Senator?

519
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:54,599
     -Hook and cook Senator.
           -Thank you.

520
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:56,734
              MAN:
Fish Senator has sliced almonds,

521
00:18:56,736 --> 00:18:59,003
and then they put mushroom sauce
          over the top.

522
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:00,771
          It's so good.

523
00:19:00,773 --> 00:19:03,107
       All right. Senator style.
             Run me through it.

524
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:04,876
-We're gonna dredge it in flour.
             -Okay.

525
00:19:04,878 --> 00:19:07,545
      Egg wash,
and then encrust it in almonds.

526
00:19:07,547 --> 00:19:09,680
   I'm gonna heat
some clarified butter.

527
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:10,882
           So the fish cooks up.

528
00:19:10,884 --> 00:19:12,984
             While that's going,
               we start the --

529
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:15,186
Mushroom garlic butter sauce.

530
00:19:15,188 --> 00:19:16,454
                   Hit it.

531
00:19:16,456 --> 00:19:18,723
I'm gonna add a little butter,
 a little garlic...

532
00:19:18,725 --> 00:19:21,492
             -Okay.
    -...mushrooms, scallions,

533
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:25,062
then add a little bit of salt,
a little parsley, lemon juice.

534
00:19:25,064 --> 00:19:26,831
      And a little white pepper?

535
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,066
              And this will all
           be plated up on what?

536
00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:31,936
A bed of rice, I like it. We
make a different rice every day,

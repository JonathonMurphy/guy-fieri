1
00:00:01,135 --> 00:00:02,201
           Hey there.

2
00:00:02,203 --> 00:00:03,736
         I'm Guy Fieri,
     and we're rolling out,

3
00:00:03,738 --> 00:00:05,871
      looking for America's
        greatest diners,

4
00:00:05,873 --> 00:00:07,006
      drive-ins and dives.

5
00:00:07,008 --> 00:00:08,674
          -This trip...
              -Wow.

6
00:00:08,676 --> 00:00:10,609
        We're throwing it
        into overdrive...

7
00:00:10,611 --> 00:00:12,244
        This dude does not stop.

8
00:00:12,246 --> 00:00:14,913
       Cooking it up with
 some killer kitchen equipment.

9
00:00:14,915 --> 00:00:16,482
              That is awesome.

10
00:00:16,484 --> 00:00:17,716
       In San Francisco...

11
00:00:17,718 --> 00:00:19,551
        Holy breakdown shoulder.

12
00:00:19,553 --> 00:00:21,053
  An all-out barbecue joint...

13
00:00:21,055 --> 00:00:22,855
          We're gonna have to go
             anaconda on my jaw.

14
00:00:22,857 --> 00:00:25,457
       Going to town with
     some rare city smokers.

15
00:00:25,459 --> 00:00:26,525
These are grandfathered in?

16
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:27,760
         Yes, they are.

17
00:00:27,762 --> 00:00:28,761
        FIERI: In Maui...

18
00:00:28,763 --> 00:00:29,762
            What a great set-up.

19
00:00:29,764 --> 00:00:31,263
 A tricked out pizza trailer...

20
00:00:31,265 --> 00:00:32,698
               Buddy, you just
              don't make sense.

21
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,267
         Putting out pie
   from their oven on wheels.

22
00:00:35,269 --> 00:00:37,636
   You can't get pizza that good
            in most restaurants.

23
00:00:37,638 --> 00:00:38,971
 And in Stockton, California...

24
00:00:38,973 --> 00:00:40,472
                Night-night.

25
00:00:40,474 --> 00:00:42,641
        A blow-your-mind
       ravioli machine...

26
00:00:42,643 --> 00:00:44,643
         Ravioli train is coming
            along to Flavortown.

27
00:00:44,645 --> 00:00:47,279
       Chugging along for
         over a century.

28
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:50,716
  I've seen really cool kitchen
      equipment in my day.

29
00:00:50,718 --> 00:00:52,718
   This might be the coolest.

30
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,453
     That's all right here,
           right now,

31
00:00:54,455 --> 00:00:57,322
           on "Diners,
       Drive-Ins & Dives."

32
00:01:09,603 --> 00:01:11,737
    So I'm here at Stockton,
           California,

33
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:14,440
     a city that was founded
          back in 1849,

34
00:01:14,442 --> 00:01:15,941
      so a ton of history.

35
00:01:15,943 --> 00:01:18,143
 And you find a place this old,
 you know what you're gonna get?

36
00:01:18,145 --> 00:01:20,379
     Probably an old-school
     Italian deli somewhere.

37
00:01:20,381 --> 00:01:22,114
       And that's exactly
       what we have here.

38
00:01:22,116 --> 00:01:23,849
           These folks
      for three generations

39
00:01:23,851 --> 00:01:26,051
    have been scratch-making
       the Italian sausage

40
00:01:26,053 --> 00:01:28,787
         and making over
     4,000 raviolis a week.

41
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:30,656
      This is Gian's Deli.

42
00:01:33,327 --> 00:01:34,560
          Pesto pasta.

43
00:01:34,562 --> 00:01:36,762
 -Everybody knows about Gian's.
          -It is truly

44
00:01:36,764 --> 00:01:40,099
     that Italian experience
 transplanted here in Stockton.

45
00:01:40,101 --> 00:01:41,700
       FIERI: Conjured up
       by Gian Bolognini's

46
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:46,338
    cousins generations ago,
  and in 1968, 18-year-old Gian

47
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,173
  arrived and joined the team.

48
00:01:48,175 --> 00:01:49,475
       MAN: Gian came from
        a little village

49
00:01:49,477 --> 00:01:52,311
       up in the foothills
   above Lucca called Corfino.

50
00:01:52,313 --> 00:01:54,279
       FIERI: He took over
         the biz in '72.

51
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:57,983
     Then in 2008, son Jeff
  and his family took the helm

52
00:01:57,985 --> 00:01:59,985
         and have stuck
    to what's tried and true.

53
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:02,588
       Where did that come from?

54
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,756
    Hundred-year-old machine.
  Came from another restaurant

55
00:02:04,758 --> 00:02:06,592
      that was in business
       for about 80 years.

56
00:02:06,594 --> 00:02:07,993
              That is awesome.

57
00:02:07,995 --> 00:02:11,230
    FIERI: Still cranking out
   raviolis by the table load.

58
00:02:11,232 --> 00:02:12,898
  How many raviolis
you guys make a week?

59
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,100
              About 300 pounds.
A lot of raviolis.

60
00:02:15,102 --> 00:02:17,269
  Everybody loves the raviolis.
   Can't order enough of 'em.

61
00:02:17,271 --> 00:02:18,604
    What type of
 raviolis you make?

62
00:02:18,606 --> 00:02:21,840
          Beef, cheese, spinach,
        Swiss chard combination.

63
00:02:21,842 --> 00:02:23,242
    All that together?
                  Yes, sir.

64
00:02:23,244 --> 00:02:25,978
     They are excellent.
 All right, brother.
    Where we at?

65
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:26,979
              Ravioli filling.

66
00:02:26,981 --> 00:02:29,148
   Swiss chard, spinach, onions,

67
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:32,351
          celery, parsley pureed
             with spices, eggs.

68
00:02:32,353 --> 00:02:34,486
Gotta have a little binder.
                        Beef.

69
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:38,123
 Freshly ground Parmesan cheese,
  bread crumbs, salt and pepper.

70
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:39,158
           Two to three minutes.

71
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,526
And what happens to it
     after this?

72
00:02:40,528 --> 00:02:41,660
        We let it sit overnight,

73
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:43,862
               get it to draw
      some of that moisture out.

74
00:02:43,864 --> 00:02:46,899
  FIERI: And while that rests,
  it's go time for dough time,

75
00:02:46,901 --> 00:02:48,433
         and lots of it.

76
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:51,170
  Basketball-sized dough balls
      are floured and sent

77
00:02:51,172 --> 00:02:54,239
   through a sheeter ten times
   to get the right thickness.

78
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:56,141
       Then it's laid out
        on a pasta table

79
00:02:56,143 --> 00:03:00,179
       big enough to make
         2,700 raviolis.

80
00:03:00,181 --> 00:03:02,447
             Now that we've made
          the ravioli filling...

81
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:06,151
So you just keep scooping it,
keep filling it, smearing it.

82
00:03:06,153 --> 00:03:08,320
                    Yup.

83
00:03:08,322 --> 00:03:09,755
I get my Zen moment going.

84
00:03:09,757 --> 00:03:12,057
 I just come in here
  for some therapy.

85
00:03:12,059 --> 00:03:14,493
Now we take down the guard rails
               just like that.

86
00:03:14,495 --> 00:03:15,827
             Take the top piece.

87
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:17,062
   Okay.
                   Gently.

88
00:03:17,064 --> 00:03:19,431
This is a two person job.
                  Absolutely.

89
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:21,934
              It's like making
             a big ravioli bed.

90
00:03:21,936 --> 00:03:25,170
                Night night.
         See you in the morning.

91
00:03:25,172 --> 00:03:27,272
 Etched it down just
  to seal the ends.

92
00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:29,374
                           Okay.
And we're gonna pull that off.

93
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:32,110
          Is this gonna come off
        the rails and drive down

94
00:03:32,112 --> 00:03:33,712
                like a little
               ravioli train?

95
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:37,115
     Yes, it is.
               Oh, I love it.

96
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:40,285
         Ravioli train is coming
               to Flavortown.

97
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:43,689
           Whoo whoo!

98
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:45,324
              Wow.

99
00:03:45,326 --> 00:03:46,925
          That's nuts.

100
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:51,663
     I have seen really cool
  kitchen equipment in my day.

101
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:53,599
   This might be the coolest.

102
00:03:53,601 --> 00:03:56,501
            It's like a mattress
               in Flavortown.

103
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:59,571
Now we cut 'em nine across.

104
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:01,340
Now what are we into?
            Pasta sauce.

105
00:04:01,342 --> 00:04:02,574
        Okay.

106
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,042
             Olive oil, onions.

107
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:06,912
So this is a generic,
almost a bolognese sauce.

108
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:08,280
                    Yeah.
             You take some beef.

109
00:04:08,282 --> 00:04:09,881
        We're gonna get all that
               nice and brown.

110
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:12,017
       Celery, parsley, carrots.

111
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:14,052
And these are all recipes
 that your dad had.

112
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:16,788
     Or that my grandmother used
            and his family used.

113
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,257
      And after about 30 minutes
                 of cooking,

114
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:20,125
               we're gonna add
             some tomato paste,

115
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:21,360
                tomato puree,

116
00:04:21,362 --> 00:04:22,394
             our browned onions,

117
00:04:22,396 --> 00:04:24,796
    beef, and celery concoction,

118
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:26,898
                salt, pepper,
              red chili flakes,

119
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,400
              some white wine,

120
00:04:28,402 --> 00:04:29,835
                 chopped up
             porcini mushrooms.

121
00:04:29,837 --> 00:04:31,603
Dried porcinis rehydrated.

122
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,405
             Water that we used
              in the porcinis.

123
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,940
The steeping liquid,
       got it.

124
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:36,842
     We're gonna let that simmer
              for eight hours.

125
00:04:36,844 --> 00:04:38,777
 And so that's gonna
be used on the ravioli,

126
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:40,045
 this is the go-to.

127
00:04:40,047 --> 00:04:42,514
                 Spaghetti.
          That's it right there.
     Got it.

128
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:44,249
       Now we got those raviolis
                that we made,

129
00:04:44,251 --> 00:04:45,250
             two, three minutes.

130
00:04:45,252 --> 00:04:47,552
              Float to the top,
                they're done.

131
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:49,521
     Now we're gonna add some of
        our homemade meat sauce,

132
00:04:49,523 --> 00:04:50,722
            give it a good stir.

133
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:52,691
    They soak up
a little bit of sauce.

134
00:04:52,693 --> 00:04:54,126
        Freshly grated Parmesan.

135
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:55,727
        And another little stir.

136
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:58,997
     That's what
 I'm talking about.

137
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:02,301
           Garnish with a little
               extra Parmesan.

138
00:05:02,303 --> 00:05:04,102
Welcome to food coma.

139
00:05:10,778 --> 00:05:12,277
   Oh, I'm sorry.

140
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:13,679
I was somewhere else.

141
00:05:13,681 --> 00:05:18,016
 So it takes me back
  to my childhood.

142
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:20,752
Tender, nice little texture
to the pasta itself.

143
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:24,756
  A good balance of
the Swiss chard to the meat.

144
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:26,591
And I love the meat sauce.
  It's very simple.

145
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:28,927
 Just little pillows
   of perfection.

146
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:38,003
I literally could eat
about three plates of these.

147
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:39,571
          -Ravioli up.
         -Can't beat it.

148
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:41,807
    MAN: The spinach filling
      is the perfect bite.

149
00:05:41,809 --> 00:05:42,908
          Great flavor.

150
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:44,543
       WOMAN: You can get
       the frozen raviolis

151
00:05:44,545 --> 00:05:46,244
    and the frozen meat sauce
          to take home.

152
00:05:46,246 --> 00:05:47,779
You have a ravioli train.

153
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:49,214
 That is so unfair.

154
00:05:49,216 --> 00:05:50,582
I want a ravioli train.

155
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:51,917
    Or how about
 their meat cannon?

156
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:55,754
It's like the artillery center
   in Flavortown.

157
00:05:55,756 --> 00:05:57,155
  Oh, yes to that.

158
00:05:57,157 --> 00:05:59,057
  And we're firing
 this baby up next.

159
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:05,997
       FIERI: Gian's deli
    at Stockton, California,

160
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:08,233
      is about as real deal
           as it gets.

161
00:06:08,235 --> 00:06:09,368
       Old school Italian.

162
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,370
Still got all the big blocks
      of cheese

163
00:06:11,372 --> 00:06:14,206
and all the big salumi hair
and they're slicing it to order.

164
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,307
            I've often come here

165
00:06:15,309 --> 00:06:16,775
           when I need something
                 last minute

166
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:18,343
          for an Italian dinner.

167
00:06:18,345 --> 00:06:19,578
            You know,
  whatever you want for lunch,

168
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,712
    they'll make it for you.

169
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,147
    Sausage pepper sandwich.

170
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:24,249
 WOMAN: The sausage is homemade

171
00:06:24,251 --> 00:06:27,119
            and it's
      absolutely delicious.

172
00:06:27,121 --> 00:06:28,587
FIERI: Okay, now we're
into making sausage.

173
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:33,058
             Pork butt, pepper,
                salt, sugar,

174
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,693
          curing salt, allspice.

175
00:06:34,695 --> 00:06:35,894
    A lot of it.

176
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:39,664
          Nutmeg, garlic powder,
        and a little white wine.

177
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:42,734
    Mix this all up until we get
 a nice little bowling ball size

178
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:43,935
           to put in the hopper.

179
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:45,003
 Hopper non-stopper.

180
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:46,037
 Look at the size --

181
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:50,542
   Luke, I am your
  Italian sausage.

182
00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:51,943
              Think we're ready
                 to go here.

183
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:56,014
 Oh, it doesn't have
it's own cool little hinge.

184
00:06:56,016 --> 00:07:00,085
It's like the artillery center
   in Flavortown.

185
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:01,319
        Hook up the hog casings.

186
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:03,488
If I had this in the back
 of a covered wagon,

187
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,891
I'd be called Josey Wales.

188
00:07:05,893 --> 00:07:08,260
    [ Imitating machine gun ]

189
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:12,397
                 All right.
         We're ready to spin it.

190
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:15,500
We're a good team here.
     All right.

191
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:18,770
So now we're gonna take it,
tie it off with string.

192
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:19,938
                  Poke 'em.

193
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,606
  Let a little bit
   of the air out.

194
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:23,575
   Let these hang for about two,
      three days in the walk-in.

195
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:24,643
Build all that flavor.

196
00:07:24,645 --> 00:07:27,779
    Now we're gonna slice it up.

197
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:29,481
             A browned homemade
               Italian sausage

198
00:07:29,483 --> 00:07:33,285
with the homemade focaccia bread
        with some teleme cheese.

199
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:36,254
             We'll finish it off
                in the oven.

200
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:37,522
                 All right.

201
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:40,225
       And fire roasted red bell
          pepper, spicy mustard.

202
00:07:40,227 --> 00:07:41,960
      Mustard.

203
00:07:44,665 --> 00:07:46,264
    Nicely done.

204
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:47,933
Baked the focaccia yourself?

205
00:07:47,935 --> 00:07:50,402
                 Every day.

206
00:07:50,404 --> 00:07:51,903
It's really dynamite.

207
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:53,305
I love the texture of it.

208
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:55,540
The way that you guys get
your grind done for your pork

209
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:57,742
    is right on.

210
00:07:57,744 --> 00:07:58,944
It does a lot of allspice.

211
00:07:58,946 --> 00:08:00,011
It almost has like a little

212
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:02,414
 Swiss-Italian type
 of a flavor to it.

213
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:04,883
And to think that that sausage
recipe still continues on.

214
00:08:04,885 --> 00:08:07,219
   It's good, man.

215
00:08:07,221 --> 00:08:09,221
     It is a solid sandwich
           every time.

216
00:08:09,223 --> 00:08:11,256
         It's got spice
        but it's not hot.

217
00:08:11,258 --> 00:08:12,591
      From the fresh bread

218
00:08:12,593 --> 00:08:15,260
  to the mustard, the sausage,
         the red pepper.

219
00:08:15,262 --> 00:08:16,795
  I mean, how can you go wrong?

220
00:08:16,797 --> 00:08:18,396
    Nothing compares to this.

221
00:08:18,398 --> 00:08:20,632
       My dad was a big believer
       in treating people right,

222
00:08:20,634 --> 00:08:22,267
                serving them
     good quality food homemade.

223
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:24,035
It's a really neat thing
to see how much pride

224
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:25,770
 and how much energy
and how much enthusiasm

225
00:08:25,772 --> 00:08:26,905
that you're carrying on.

226
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:27,939
You ought to be proud.

227
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:30,308
                 Thank you.

228
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:33,211
   Coming up, a southern joint
       in San Francisco...

229
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:34,846
          This is kinda barbecue
                 plus plus.

230
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,781
       Where the biscuits
         are behemoth...

231
00:08:36,783 --> 00:08:39,317
  If you can eat the whole thing
        in a day, you win a car?

232
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:40,318
   And the lamb, well, it's...

233
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,319
                 Lights out.
Awesome.

234
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:42,287
               Excellent job.

235
00:08:50,264 --> 00:08:51,530
   I'm here at San Francisco.

236
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:52,731
        I love this city.

237
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:54,466
   I mean, you're talking tons
           of history,

238
00:08:54,468 --> 00:08:55,901
      awesome sports teams,

239
00:08:55,903 --> 00:08:58,470
    and you wanna talk about
  big restaurants, right here.

240
00:08:58,472 --> 00:09:00,438
     But I gotta be honest,
  not too many barbecue joints.

241
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,274
          Well, I mean,
    you got Gorilla Barbecue,

242
00:09:02,276 --> 00:09:03,642
   or you could find yourself
            over here

243
00:09:03,644 --> 00:09:05,577
 on Folsom in the SoMa district

244
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:07,579
        just a few blocks
       up at union square

245
00:09:07,581 --> 00:09:09,881
  right here at CatHead's BBQ.

246
00:09:12,352 --> 00:09:15,186
         South Carolina chicken.

247
00:09:15,188 --> 00:09:17,122
     A block away your mouth
      just starts watering.

248
00:09:17,124 --> 00:09:19,224
                We have the,
             uh, brisket chili.

249
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:21,293
     It reminds me of going
       to barbecue joints

250
00:09:21,295 --> 00:09:22,427
       back in the South.

251
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:23,795
  It's like fine dining cooking

252
00:09:23,797 --> 00:09:26,197
       but with a regular,
      down-home experience.

253
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:28,567
FIERI: 'Cause owners Pam Schafer
        and Richard Park

254
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:30,936
        are just a couple
   of down-home transplants...

255
00:09:30,938 --> 00:09:32,370
             I'm from Tennessee.
            She's from Michigan.

256
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:34,673
         Cooking up some
         family fixings.

257
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:36,274
        We just bring it
  from all around the country,

258
00:09:36,276 --> 00:09:37,776
    recipes we grew up with.

259
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:39,044
      Pulled pork on a cat head.

260
00:09:39,046 --> 00:09:40,946
Why is it called cat head?

261
00:09:40,948 --> 00:09:42,180
      Cat head is a biscuit

262
00:09:42,182 --> 00:09:43,615
      in the South the size
        of a cat's head.

263
00:09:43,617 --> 00:09:45,050
     If you wanna order it,
         you definitely

264
00:09:45,052 --> 00:09:46,985
           wanna bring
      an appetite with you.

265
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:48,086
            Give me the rundown.
   All right.

266
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,220
 So we're gonna take
   some AP flour.

267
00:09:49,222 --> 00:09:50,422
                           Okay.
We're gonna put it in a bowl.

268
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:51,590
               Do you put most
              of it in the bowl

269
00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:53,124
              or do we just get
              some of it on us?

270
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:55,126
We get most of it on us
and then some of it in the bowl.

271
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:56,328
             Okay. There you go.

272
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,029
So we're gonna put some
baking powder and some salt.

273
00:09:58,031 --> 00:10:00,699
We're gonna add the butter
   and the Crisco.
                         Okay.

274
00:10:00,701 --> 00:10:03,301
  So you just kinda
get it into pea-size shapes.

275
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:04,836
                There we go.
             Making the gravel.

276
00:10:04,838 --> 00:10:05,971
 And then we'll add
   the buttermilk.

277
00:10:05,973 --> 00:10:08,907
So we're just gonna mix
     it around.

278
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:10,542
So you're just gonPu it out.
Push it out.

279
00:10:10,544 --> 00:10:13,278
  So that's the --
that's the ring mold.

280
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,147
  What, if you can eat the whole
  thing in a day, you win a car?

281
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:17,515
       Look at the size of that!

282
00:10:17,517 --> 00:10:18,850
    Pretty much.

283
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:22,520
 So we're going 355
for about 30 minutes.

284
00:10:22,522 --> 00:10:24,022
             All right. Next up.
  Dry rub.

285
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:26,091
    Brown sugar,
  Peruvian paprika.

286
00:10:26,093 --> 00:10:27,359
      It's the one I always use.

287
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:28,526
   Garlic powder.
                           Okay.

288
00:10:28,528 --> 00:10:31,663
Black pepper, cayenne,
    chili powder.

289
00:10:31,665 --> 00:10:32,831
               A ton of cumin.

290
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:37,135
Some, uh, onion powder,
   salt, allspice,

291
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:39,104
poultry seasoning, cinnamon,

292
00:10:39,106 --> 00:10:40,472
  and, uh, nutmeg.

293
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:43,441
    It's like the United Nations
         of seasonings going on.

294
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:45,043
So what we're going to do now

295
00:10:45,045 --> 00:10:46,845
 is we're just gonna
take our, uh, pork butt.

296
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:48,880
                          Okay.
   Give it a nice
  little rub over.

297
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:50,382
Put a little whiskey on it.

298
00:10:50,384 --> 00:10:52,517
               Whiskey bottle.
      Take me home.

299
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:55,520
So this sits in our, uh, fridge
for a couple of days.

300
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:56,688
               How long are we
              gonna smoke that?

301
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,890
   About 14 hours.

302
00:10:58,892 --> 00:11:00,992
            Now we're making our
 North Carolina finishing sauce.

303
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,194
  You know how North Carolinians
       are about their barbecue?

304
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:05,664
  I am all down on
the vinegar side of it.

305
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,465
              Well, this one's
               a little mixed.

306
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:11,436
So we're gonna add some ketchup,
some cider vinegar, brown sugar.

307
00:11:11,438 --> 00:11:12,437
        Okay.

308
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:14,973
               Some, uh, salt,
                black pepper.

309
00:11:14,975 --> 00:11:17,142
You can hear that thing gurgling
 in there right now.

310
00:11:17,144 --> 00:11:20,111
                Chili flake,
            some Worcestershire.

311
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:21,146
     Hot sauce.

312
00:11:21,148 --> 00:11:22,781
                Whisk it up,
             bring it to a boil.

313
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:24,916
            And, uh, it's done.
Oh, and that's gonna

314
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:27,152
go with that pulled pork
  on that cat head?

315
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:28,286
                        Yup.
    [ Whistles ]

316
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:31,623
 This has been going
 for about 14 hours.

317
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:32,757
                Nicely done.

318
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:34,092
Give it a little salt.

319
00:11:34,094 --> 00:11:36,027
And this is the finishing sauce
that we made earlier.

320
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:38,163
  We're gonna take
the cat head biscuit.

321
00:11:38,165 --> 00:11:39,330
This is mustard slaw.

322
00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:41,733
                    Okay.

323
00:11:41,735 --> 00:11:43,268
    Put a little
of these pickles on there.

324
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,704
  And there you go.

325
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:48,073
          We're gonna have to go
             anaconda on my jaw.

326
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:53,111
                     Mm.

327
00:11:53,113 --> 00:11:57,582
     The pork's got great flavor
     to it, nice, tangy vinegar.

328
00:11:57,584 --> 00:11:58,683
                Slaw's great.

329
00:11:58,685 --> 00:12:00,151
         Carolina sauce is dyno.

330
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:03,188
  And that's a nice big biscuit.
                  Oh, boy.

331
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,523
     You know, we just don't get
   enough of this in California.

332
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:07,492
                 Well done.
                Really good.

333
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:08,827
        Cat head biscuit.

334
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:10,795
It's a knife and fork
    kind of meal.

335
00:12:10,797 --> 00:12:12,330
       It's just perfect.
         It's delicious.

336
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:14,065
     It's spicy.
It's a little smoky.

337
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:15,233
      FIERI: Folks come in.

338
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:17,168
     It smells like barbecue
       right off the bat.

339
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:18,336
 You have these beautiful pits.

340
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:20,271
These are grandfathered in?
                Yes, they are.

341
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:21,106
  We're one of two restaurants
   in the city that has them.

342
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:22,540
e most of it,
These are grandfathered in?
                Yes, they are.

343
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:24,709
         smoking up all
      the usual suspects...

344
00:12:24,711 --> 00:12:28,113
St. Louis cut ribs.
        And even mixed in
       a little wild card.

345
00:12:28,115 --> 00:12:29,581
                Smoked lamb.

346
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,750
 You don't really think of lamb
   as, like, a barbecue item.

347
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:34,052
    But this stuff's perfect.

348
00:12:34,054 --> 00:12:36,454
       FIERI: Let's get into it.
I'm gonna make a spice rub.

349
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:39,124
    Dry mustard,
  cumin, allspice,

350
00:12:39,126 --> 00:12:41,659
    chili flake,
cinna-manum-manum-mum-mum.

351
00:12:41,661 --> 00:12:42,927
        FIERI: Hey, wait.
         That's my line!

352
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:44,429
Nutmeg, brown sugar,

353
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:47,198
a lot of salt, paprika,

354
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,067
black pepper and oregano.

355
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:50,969
  And this is just for the lamb.
This is just for the lamb.

356
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:52,103
  We don't do this
 for anything else.

357
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:54,339
  Now it's bone-in
   lamb shoulder.

358
00:12:54,341 --> 00:12:56,574
  Uh, let this also go 48 hours?
Yeah.

359
00:12:56,576 --> 00:12:58,343
We marinate everything
 at least 48 hours.

360
00:12:58,345 --> 00:12:59,911
     Then how long is this gonna
              go in the smoker?

361
00:12:59,913 --> 00:13:01,579
    This goes for
about eight to ten hours,

362
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:03,114
    low and slow.
     All right.

363
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,116
So what we're gonna do now,
we're making an apple slaw.

364
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:08,119
Take some red cabbage, some,
uh, Granny Smith apples.

365
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:09,554
We're gonna just grate those.

366
00:13:09,556 --> 00:13:11,456
       We're gonna degrade them?
            You're a dumb apple.

367
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,324
We're gonna grate them.
            You're so not liked.

368
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:15,093
Then we're gonna take
just a bulb of fennel.

369
00:13:15,095 --> 00:13:17,162
                    Okay.
          Ah, it's good looking.

370
00:13:17,164 --> 00:13:19,531
         I can smell that fennel
                 right now.

371
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:21,432
All right. Let's take
some of this dressing.

372
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:23,301
                 And that's...
Mayonnaise, cider vinegar,

373
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:24,502
lemons, sugar, salt,

374
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:26,004
    black pepper,
    and allspice.

375
00:13:26,006 --> 00:13:27,405
                     Got it.
  All right, so...

376
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:29,641
        Holy breakdown shoulder.

377
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:32,544
So we're gonna shred this up,
put this on the plate

378
00:13:32,546 --> 00:13:34,179
  with a little bit
 of the apple slaw.

379
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:35,747
So we like to just, uh,

380
00:13:35,749 --> 00:13:37,382
   finish her with
just a little bit of salt

381
00:13:37,384 --> 00:13:39,617
and, uh, fennel ketchup
    that we made.

382
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:42,520
  And there you go.

383
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:45,957
 Mm. The lamb meat is very lean,
             but tons of flavor.

384
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:47,358
             And then the fennel
                 apple slaw,

385
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,829
              super refreshing,
              palate cleansing.

386
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:52,163
        The contrast of the cold

387
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:53,832
                with the hot,
        the acid of the ketchup,

388
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:56,467
 the sweetness with the richness
  and the saltiness of the lamb.

389
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:59,304
          This is kinda barbecue
                 plus plus.

390
00:13:59,306 --> 00:14:01,673
         Ah. I think for anybody
    that walks in here and says,

391
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:04,209
        "Ah, I don't like lamb,"
 well, then, you gotta try this.

392
00:14:04,211 --> 00:14:05,443
                Light's out.
 Awesome.

393
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:07,846
               Excellent job.

394
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:09,080
     WOMAN: It's not really

395
00:14:09,082 --> 00:14:11,883
      what you would expect
     when you think of lamb.

396
00:14:11,885 --> 00:14:13,651
 It's tender, juicy.

397
00:14:13,653 --> 00:14:15,787
      The apple fennel slaw
         is perfection.

398
00:14:15,789 --> 00:14:17,555
    This is the place to come
      if you love barbecue.

399
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:18,790
   FIERI: I love the smokers.

400
00:14:18,792 --> 00:14:19,958
        I love the smell.

401
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,160
        Just an awesome,
         awesome place.

402
00:14:24,164 --> 00:14:26,264
      Up next, we're headed
      to the beach in Maui.

403
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:27,398
             Too legit to quit.

404
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,734
      To chow down on some
       wood-fired pizza...

405
00:14:29,736 --> 00:14:31,703
             That is a gorgeous
             looking pie, dude.

406
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:33,404
  While soaking up the scenery.

407
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:34,706
         This is my kind of gig.

408
00:14:41,231 --> 00:14:42,730
   Now I'm over here in Maui.

409
00:14:42,732 --> 00:14:43,998
          Hit it, kid.

410
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,801
     To check out a trailer
    that the guy made himself

411
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:49,704
      and he's also scratch
    making the dough by hand!

412
00:14:49,706 --> 00:14:51,873
    This is Outrigger Pizza.

413
00:14:55,545 --> 00:14:57,545
 By far the best pizza on Maui.

414
00:14:57,547 --> 00:14:58,713
     Pizza in a parking lot.

415
00:14:58,715 --> 00:15:00,298
        Who knew it would
        taste this good.

416
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:00,932
  MAN: I'dat

417
00:15:00,934 --> 00:15:02,233
        watch himit would
        throw the pizza.

418
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,569
    FIERI: A classic pie move
    Philly native Kevin Locke

419
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:05,737
      picked up in college

420
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:07,906
         then perfected
      when he hit the road

421
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:10,808
     with this cart in 2009.

422
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,076
            I love the rig, man.

423
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:13,144
       Who built the pizza oven?

424
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:14,379
                   I did.
Did you really?

425
00:15:14,381 --> 00:15:15,847
                           Yeah.
What temperature you running?
       Seven?

426
00:15:15,849 --> 00:15:17,582
                          700.
 Yeah. What kind of
 wood are you using?

427
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:19,217
            Kiawe wood, which is
           this tree right here.

428
00:15:19,219 --> 00:15:20,718
So the local native hardwood.
                            Yup.

429
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,553
  It brings out that smokiness
          in the dough.

430
00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:23,988
      More of a flatbread style.

431
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,123
 And a lilikoi pork.

432
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,858
        The Lilikoi pizza
        tastes like Maui.

433
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,493
     MAN: It's got that nice
          pulled pork.

434
00:15:28,495 --> 00:15:30,929
          It has a nice
      little lilikoi glaze.

435
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:32,196
                  Lilikoi?
              What is lilikoi?

436
00:15:32,198 --> 00:15:34,098
Lilikoi is a passion fruit.
                          Okay.

437
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,633
          First we're gonna make
                pizza dough.

438
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:37,368
 Yup.
              Hang on a second.

439
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:41,139
             Where's the mixer?

440
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:42,307
     No mixers.
    All by hand.

441
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:43,641
                 Seriously?
  Yeah.

442
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:45,243
I add my yeast to the water.

443
00:15:45,245 --> 00:15:46,411
                       Okay.
    And my sugar.

444
00:15:46,413 --> 00:15:48,379
               Fantastic.
   Five pounds...

445
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:49,847
              I don't want you
           to take any offenses,

446
00:15:49,849 --> 00:15:51,883
but I'm gonna stand on this side
        when you pour the flour.

447
00:15:51,885 --> 00:15:53,551
   That's the side
where the wind's gonna go.

448
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:54,719
                    Okay.
                 Fantastic.

449
00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:57,121
        I'll be right over here.
Unbleached flour,

450
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:59,657
bleached flour, semolina.

451
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:02,894
And now we're gonna take out
     four pounds

452
00:16:02,896 --> 00:16:05,196
   to add that to
our second phase of the dough.

453
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:07,632
                There you go.
  water.

454
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:08,833
         So what'd you do today?

455
00:16:08,835 --> 00:16:11,469
      I watched a guy make dough
             for his pizza cart

456
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:15,006
        at the park by the water
    with some weird contraption.

457
00:16:15,008 --> 00:16:16,841
Danish whisk.
                    You Danish?

458
00:16:16,843 --> 00:16:18,042
         No.

459
00:16:18,044 --> 00:16:20,578
So we're gonna add our activated
  yeast and water.

460
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,714
                     Okay.
Now we'll wait two hours
  for this to poof.

461
00:16:22,716 --> 00:16:26,017
               Oh. [ Laughs ]

462
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:27,685
                 To do what?

463
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:28,786
        Rise.
                      Good.

464
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:30,788
 Now that we've let
   the dough rise,

465
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:34,492
we're gonna reintroduce
our four pounds of flour.

466
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:36,394
 Hawaiian sea salt.

467
00:16:36,396 --> 00:16:37,628
                 All right.
             So that's together.

468
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:40,264
  Two hours later,
we're gonna knead the dough.

469
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:43,201
And into our plastic bag
and then refrigeration.

470
00:16:43,203 --> 00:16:44,702
Let it rest for two days.

471
00:16:44,704 --> 00:16:46,337
               How many ounces
     did you weight this out to?

472
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:48,539
    Four ounces.
              Dough is resting.

473
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,875
      Now we're going to dry rub
               the pork butt.

474
00:16:50,877 --> 00:16:55,346
Coarse black pepper, cumin,
chili powder, garlic,

475
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,348
onion powder, parsley,

476
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,983
and quite a bit of salt.

477
00:16:58,985 --> 00:17:01,652
We're gonna mix this up.
             Generously rub this
                on the pork?

478
00:17:01,654 --> 00:17:03,554
  Yup.
              This is awesome.

479
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:04,856
                         Okay.
   A cup of water.

480
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,891
               So a little bit
             of braising liquid.

481
00:17:06,893 --> 00:17:08,926
 Pop it in the oven.
     And how long's it gonna go?

482
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:11,095
Three and a half hours
       at 350.

483
00:17:11,097 --> 00:17:12,997
       Pull it out, let it cool,
         give it a little shred?

484
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:15,233
   Yup.
                Pork's done.

485
00:17:15,235 --> 00:17:16,467
                Dough's done.

486
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:18,636
So put a little bit of flour
 on our dough ball.

487
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:21,773
Then we're gonna press it out
without touching the edges.

488
00:17:21,775 --> 00:17:22,974
              So you can build
               a little crust.

489
00:17:22,976 --> 00:17:24,375
   Boy, that's some loose dough.

490
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:26,744
                Look at that.
       Little centrifugal force.

491
00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:29,280
               Little semolina
         for some ball bearings.

492
00:17:29,282 --> 00:17:32,917
And then we're gonna do
our garlic aioli base,

493
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:34,952
little bit of garlic,
      the pork,

494
00:17:34,954 --> 00:17:38,623
 Maui sweet onions,
 sweet bell peppers,

495
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:41,626
 mozzarella cheese,
little bit of Romano.

496
00:17:41,628 --> 00:17:42,894
    Boy, that oven's hot, buddy.

497
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:44,862
   They only take
about 90 seconds to cook.

498
00:17:44,864 --> 00:17:46,531
             What a great setup.

499
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:49,167
             That is a gorgeous
             looking pie, dude.

500
00:17:49,169 --> 00:17:51,569
    Do some, uh,
   fresh Parmesan.

501
00:17:55,008 --> 00:17:57,842
And here's our specialty,
    the lilikoi.

502
00:17:57,844 --> 00:18:01,712
              Beautiful pizza.

503
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:03,114
               It's dynamite.

504
00:18:03,116 --> 00:18:08,119
                The crust is
             too legit to quit.

505
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,690
            Not too much cheese.
             Nothing's overdone.

506
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:14,959
 When you do get the little bite
           of pork, you love it.

507
00:18:14,961 --> 00:18:16,527
       When you get a little bit
               of the pepper,

508
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:18,029
            you're down with it.

509
00:18:18,031 --> 00:18:19,997
          Really dynamite pizza.

510
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:22,133
        -A lilikoi pork.
         -Sweet, savory.

511
00:18:22,135 --> 00:18:23,434
    Dough is crisp, a little

512
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:25,002
    charred on the underside
       the way I like it.

513
00:18:25,004 --> 00:18:26,237
        MAN: Real tender
         piece of pork.

514
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:27,438
      It's got a little bit
       of fattiness to it,

515
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,539
      which is really good.

516
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,174
     And it goes really well
        with the lilikoi.

517
00:18:30,176 --> 00:18:32,410
        This is my favorite kind
            of pizza restaurant,

518
00:18:32,412 --> 00:18:34,245
            is sitting out here,
         checking out the water.

519
00:18:34,247 --> 00:18:35,646
  Italian sausage.

520
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:37,348
       My favorite pizza?
       The sausage pizza.

521
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,716
 MAN: His homemade pizza sauce,

522
00:18:38,718 --> 00:18:40,485
        I haven't tasted
 anything like it anywhere else

523
00:18:40,487 --> 00:18:42,086
         on the island.

524
00:18:42,088 --> 00:18:44,021
          All right, what are we
              gonna make next?
  Italian sausage.

525
00:18:44,023 --> 00:18:45,723
      You guys are making almost
        everything from scratch.

526
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:47,024
Yes. We're gonna make
   some red sauce.

527
00:18:47,026 --> 00:18:48,292
                  Go ahead.
          I'm standing over here

528
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:49,494
      because I'm in light blue.

529
00:18:49,496 --> 00:18:50,895
You might get red.
      And I can already tell you

530
00:18:50,897 --> 00:18:52,763
          that that tomato sauce
           is gonna make a mess.

531
00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:55,433
  Ground tomatoes,
 granulated garlic,

532
00:18:55,435 --> 00:18:56,767
one teaspoon of basil,

533
00:18:56,769 --> 00:18:58,970
one teaspoon of thyme,
      oregano,

534
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:02,106
 black pepper, salt,
teaspoon of cinnamon, nutmeg.

535
00:19:02,108 --> 00:19:03,241
And then we're gonna
    mix it here.

536
00:19:03,243 --> 00:19:04,709
           We made dough by hand

537
00:19:04,711 --> 00:19:07,512
        and now you're gonna use
             an electric mixer?

538
00:19:07,514 --> 00:19:09,280
               Buddy, you just
              don't make sense.

539
00:19:09,282 --> 00:19:10,615
One cup of olive oil.

540
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:13,284
Give it a little bit
     of flavor.

541
00:19:13,286 --> 00:19:15,853
   And the sauce,
   ground sausage,

542
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:19,423
 Maui sweet onions,
     mushrooms,

543
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:21,192
and some green peppers.

544
00:19:21,194 --> 00:19:24,362
     Mozzarella,
  top with Romano.

545
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:27,331
Back into the oven.
                 90 seconds.

546
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,233
         This is my kind of gig.

547
00:19:29,235 --> 00:19:31,869
        To be outside like this?
 The life.

548
00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:33,271
               What do you do
            during the holidays?

549
00:19:33,273 --> 00:19:35,373
I sell Christmas trees.

550
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,175
        This dude does not stop.

551
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:39,110
    There you go.
Fresh Parmesan again.

552
00:19:39,112 --> 00:19:41,412
Little bit of truffle salt.

553
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:44,248
  Hear the crunch?

554
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,616
                     Mm.

555
00:19:45,618 --> 00:19:46,951
          Look how thin that is.

556
00:19:46,953 --> 00:19:48,553
      Nice crust, a little char.

557
00:19:48,555 --> 00:19:50,888
             What I like is that
         you're not heavy-handed

558
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:53,758
          with your ingredients.

559
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,093
         It's not supposed to be
              the gooey cheese

560
00:19:56,095 --> 00:19:58,062
               stretching off
              into the sunset.

561
00:19:58,064 --> 00:20:00,231
   It's supposed to be a balance
        between all the flavors.

562
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:01,832
       You can taste everything.
               I'm impressed.

563
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:03,834
                 I wanna buy
           a Christmas tree now.

564
00:20:03,836 --> 00:20:05,836
  Italian sausage.

565
00:20:05,838 --> 00:20:07,371
         Italian sausage
         is really good.

566
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:09,240
   The peppers on it gives it
     that extra little kick.

567
00:20:09,242 --> 00:20:10,241
   It really pops with flavor.

568
00:20:10,243 --> 00:20:11,442
 It's an incredible experience.

569
00:20:11,444 --> 00:20:12,810
          It really is.
        We're very lucky.

570
00:20:12,812 --> 00:20:14,645
   You can't get pizza that good
            at most restaurants.

571
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:16,214
  And I'm doing it
right here on a trailer.

572
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:18,316
                 Well done.
Thank you.

573
00:20:18,318 --> 00:20:20,551
  Was that a road trip or what?

574
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:21,986
        But don't worry.

575
00:20:21,988 --> 00:20:24,355
   There's plenty more joints
  all over this great country.

576
00:20:24,357 --> 00:20:27,058
     I'll be looking for you
     next time on Triple D.

577
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,359
              Think we're ready
                 to go here?

578
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:30,127
     I got him.

579
00:20:30,129 --> 00:20:32,096
   Cover my back.

00:00:01,268 --> 00:00:02,334
         Hey, everybody.

2
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:03,802
         I'm Guy Fieri,
      and we're rolling out

3
00:00:03,804 --> 00:00:06,105
 looking for America's greatest
 diners, drive-ins, and dives.

4
00:00:06,107 --> 00:00:07,506
          This trip...
                    Let's do it.

5
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:09,274
   ...we're tackling tacos...

6
00:00:09,276 --> 00:00:11,443
 I don't know if I should eat it
      or take a picture with it.

7
00:00:11,445 --> 00:00:13,779
         ...tri-tips...
That's competition tri-tip
     right there.

8
00:00:13,781 --> 00:00:15,514
...and a tasty island tradition.

9
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:17,850
                  Then you
             "sophistifunk" it.

10
00:00:17,852 --> 00:00:20,252
   In Stockton, California...
                         Ow!

11
00:00:20,254 --> 00:00:21,653
     ...a little New Orleans
            flavor...

12
00:00:21,655 --> 00:00:22,955
    Get after it.

13
00:00:22,957 --> 00:00:24,857
      ...with a meaty take
          on the crepe.

14
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:27,159
             That does not sound
   like any crepe I've ever had.

15
00:00:27,161 --> 00:00:28,627
    In Islamorada, Florida...

16
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:30,729
 Dude!
       ...a local icon...

17
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:32,464
             I'm excited to see
       what's gonna happen here.

18
00:00:32,466 --> 00:00:34,800
         ...shelling out
      their legendary stew.

19
00:00:34,802 --> 00:00:37,369
I don't know that most
people have ever had turtle.

20
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:38,704
  And in Oakland, California...

21
00:00:38,706 --> 00:00:39,705
            Gorgeous.

22
00:00:39,707 --> 00:00:41,306
  ...a true taste of Mexico...

23
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:42,808
             I feel like I need
                my passport.

24
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:46,011
        ...at the corner
  of Authentic and Outrageous.

25
00:00:46,013 --> 00:00:49,048
         How did our bite taste?
              Tastes fantastic.

26
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:50,849
     That's all right here,
           right now,

27
00:00:50,851 --> 00:00:53,485

           and Dives."

29
00:01:03,798 --> 00:01:06,398
     So, you know that when
     you're enjoying a meal

30
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,666
     it's not just the food
         you're eating,

31
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:09,034
       it's the experience
         you're having.

32
00:01:09,036 --> 00:01:11,070
      You want a real-deal
        pizza experience,

33
00:01:11,072 --> 00:01:12,438
    you're in a pizza parlor.

34
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,406
    You want to have sausage
 and beer, you're in a hofbrau.

35
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:16,008
         You're looking
       for some authentic,

36
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:18,544
     real-deal Mexican food,
   where do you find yourself?

37
00:01:18,546 --> 00:01:20,212
    How about an open market?

38
00:01:20,214 --> 00:01:22,848
     So I'm here in Oakland,
   California, in Old Oakland,

39
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:24,516
   to check out the real deal.

40
00:01:24,518 --> 00:01:26,285
        This is Cosecha.

41
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:31,757
                Here you go,
               pico de gallo.

42
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,560
WOMAN: I've been to, like, every
type of Mexican restaurant,

43
00:01:34,562 --> 00:01:36,962
    and, by far,
 Cosecha's the best.

44
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:38,163
       Four tacos all day?

45
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:40,499
                    MAN:
   Dominica is truly the nicest,

46
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:43,135
   most engaging chef in Oakland
               that I know of.

47
00:01:43,137 --> 00:01:46,371
 FIERI: And Dominica Rice earned
 those chops working in kitchens

48
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:49,441
   from San Fran to Manhattan
        to Mexico City...

49
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:50,776
             I got it, I got it.

50
00:01:50,778 --> 00:01:52,077
    ...before setting up shop

51
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,714
       in a nearly vacant
      marketplace in 2011.

52
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:58,083
  When people started to realize
          how good her food was,

53
00:01:58,085 --> 00:02:01,253
           how authentic it was,
she really filled this place up.

54
00:02:01,255 --> 00:02:03,055
 A revival happened,
  which was great.

55
00:02:03,057 --> 00:02:05,157
                  What kind
    of Mexican restaurant is it?

56
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:07,025
     We're doing
Oakland Mexican food.

57
00:02:07,027 --> 00:02:09,361
This type of cooking
has always been in California.

58
00:02:09,363 --> 00:02:10,929
     But it's her own twist
           on the taco

59
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:12,764
        that's got folks
       filling this joint.

60
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:15,734
    Fish tacos, shrimp tacos,
        pork belly tacos.

61
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:17,736
       We have two orders
         of pork belly.

62
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:21,607
         Amazing, juicy,
       succulent, nom nom,

63
00:02:21,609 --> 00:02:24,443
        pork belly tacos.
              Yeah!

64
00:02:24,445 --> 00:02:26,945
                 Get me into it.
This is skin-on pork belly.

65
00:02:26,947 --> 00:02:28,413
             Where'd you get all
              the earthen-ware?

66
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:31,316
I have them come in
from Mexico that we
have custom made for us,

67
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:33,185
and then the other half
comes in from Spain.

68
00:02:33,187 --> 00:02:34,453
                  Gorgeous.
                  Rumor is

69
00:02:34,455 --> 00:02:36,255
              that Alice Waters
            comes in and eats --

70
00:02:36,257 --> 00:02:38,590
      Oh, yeah.
One of the most important...
                  Amazing woman.

71
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:41,026
...woman chefs in the world,
        yeah.

72
00:02:41,028 --> 00:02:42,761
    -Salt it, and that's it?
           -That's it.

73
00:02:42,763 --> 00:02:45,564
And we let that marinate
     overnight.

74
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:48,066
  We're gonna start
to prepare the achiote paste

75
00:02:48,068 --> 00:02:49,234
 for the pork belly.

76
00:02:49,236 --> 00:02:51,203
Whole garlic, kosher salt.

77
00:02:51,205 --> 00:02:53,639
       -So, you got a nice
    little paste out of that.
              -Yes.

78
00:02:53,641 --> 00:02:56,608
And then we just add the achiote
paste, which is annatto seed.

79
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:00,245
Beautiful red color.
And we're breaking this up.

80
00:03:00,247 --> 00:03:02,181
 We're ready to add
     the citrus.

81
00:03:02,183 --> 00:03:04,416
 Oh, gracias.
           I'll load the cannon.

82
00:03:04,418 --> 00:03:07,753
 Lemon and lime and
a little bit of orange juice.

83
00:03:07,755 --> 00:03:12,357
So, take a little bit
of the achiote paste,

84
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:14,159
we're gonna rub this
   on both sides.

85
00:03:14,161 --> 00:03:15,727
     And you're doing everything
                 authentic.

86
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:17,596
       It's the whole enchilada,
              no pun intended.

87
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:18,964
    [ Chuckles ]
So, we're gonna add --

88
00:03:18,966 --> 00:03:22,267
         The Mexican mirepoix of
  jalapeños, onions, and garlic.

89
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:24,603
  Garlic, exactly.
     Here we go.

90
00:03:24,605 --> 00:03:27,506
I'm gonna top this off
with some nice cerveza.

91
00:03:27,508 --> 00:03:28,974
                    Okay.
                  Covered?

92
00:03:28,976 --> 00:03:30,776
        Yep.

93
00:03:30,778 --> 00:03:34,079
And place it into the oven
       at 350

94
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:36,148
     for an hour
   and 45 minutes.

95
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,917
  So, we're making
the pickled red onions

96
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:40,719
that we use on a lot
    of our tacos.

97
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:45,123
Kosher salt, jalapeños,
   chili de àrbol,

98
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:47,726
     the Mexican
  piloncillo sugar.

99
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:48,794
              Piloncillo sugar?

100
00:03:48,796 --> 00:03:50,529
So, this is cooked-down
  sugarcane juice.

101
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:52,664
So it has all the molasses.
Everything's together.

102
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,366
           Bay Leaves.
           -Hibiscus?

103
00:03:54,368 --> 00:03:55,601
        Yeah.
 The jamaica flower.

104
00:03:55,603 --> 00:03:57,035
Two cinnamon sticks.

105
00:03:57,037 --> 00:03:59,538
We're gonna add some water
      to that,

106
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:02,441
and then we're gonna add
  red wine vinegar.

107
00:04:02,443 --> 00:04:05,344
And I let that simmer
for about 10 to 15 minutes.

108
00:04:05,346 --> 00:04:08,513
             I'll be over here.

109
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:10,549
 Whoo! Press it down
  with the weights,

110
00:04:10,551 --> 00:04:12,551
and then let it sit for,
like, an hour and a half.

111
00:04:12,553 --> 00:04:13,619
                  Love it.

112
00:04:13,621 --> 00:04:15,120
 Then we've chilled
  our pork belly --

113
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:16,555
  And then I'll check the onions
              that we've made.

114
00:04:16,557 --> 00:04:18,790
      -Yes. Yes, yes, yes.
       -That's important.

115
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:20,859
 So, I'm gonna slice
 off a few portions.

116
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:23,462
             Those will be fine.
       A little acid bite there.

117
00:04:23,464 --> 00:04:24,730
Then we salt them up.

118
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:26,131
    And then into the non-stick.

119
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:27,566
             -Yeah.
         -Sear 'em off.

120
00:04:27,568 --> 00:04:29,635
So, we make tortillas.

121
00:04:29,637 --> 00:04:31,637
          That's, like, the most
     perfect hand-made tortilla.

122
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:33,038
They're made to order,

123
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,475
so the skin-on pork belly
I love, because it has that

124
00:04:36,477 --> 00:04:38,710
     little bit
of that chicharrón crunch.

125
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:42,247
And we put a little bit
of the tomatillo salsa.

126
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:43,515
   Pickled onion.

127
00:04:43,517 --> 00:04:46,685
  You've outweighed the tortilla
             5:1 with the pork.

128
00:04:46,687 --> 00:04:50,389
Fresh sliced jalapeño,
and then a little cilantro.

129
00:04:50,391 --> 00:04:54,159
A little sprinkle of salt
and a little bit of lime.

130
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:55,894
   Ready to roll.

131
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:01,900
             The skin is so thin
       in that part of the belly

132
00:05:01,902 --> 00:05:02,968
          it starts to crunch up

133
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,770
              with a little bit
               of its own fat.

134
00:05:04,772 --> 00:05:06,038
             It's quintessential

135
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,774
 that you have the pickled onion
              inside of there.

136
00:05:08,776 --> 00:05:10,375
            It's every aspect --
       the squeeze of the lemon,

137
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:11,543
          the touch of the salt.

138
00:05:11,545 --> 00:05:13,145
                 For people
      right now that are saying,

139
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:17,449
           "I wish I was there,"
         I'm doing this for you.

140
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:20,452
         How did our bite taste?
              Tastes fantastic.

141
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:23,655
   Two pork bellies up on 19.

142
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:26,825
     These tacos are kind of
 an emotional experience for me.

143
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:29,628
      MAN: Just perfectly crispy
         pieces of pork belly --

144
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,430
                nice contrast
             with the red onion.

145
00:05:31,432 --> 00:05:34,099
   Makes you feel like you're
   no longer in the Bay area.

146
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:36,168
             FIERI: You eat out
   of the little pottery dishes,

147
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,303
            and you're thinking,
      "I'm in a Mexican market."

148
00:05:38,305 --> 00:05:40,005
    Doesn't it feel like it?
        -Yeah, for sure.

149
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:41,940
      MAN: You can actually
       smell the tortillas

150
00:05:41,942 --> 00:05:43,241
    from about a block away,

151
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:45,610
         so it's always
      luring you over here.

152
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:47,379
-But that's not all your tricks.
              -No.

153
00:05:47,381 --> 00:05:48,647
          We have more.
     -I heard you got more.

154
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:50,749
         -Carne Adovada?
         -Carne Adovada?

155
00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:52,484
              <i> -Sí.</i>
      -You can't miss this.

156
00:05:52,486 --> 00:05:53,952
                I'll see you
              in a little bit.

157
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:56,254
    I'm gonna have one more taco
            just for us, though.

158
00:05:56,256 --> 00:05:57,756
          -[ Chuckles ]
           -Come back.

159
00:06:04,732 --> 00:06:07,766
  Welcome back. We're at Cosecha
         in Oakland, California.

160
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:10,435
           Now, I know you think
        you've seen enough tacos

161
00:06:10,437 --> 00:06:12,237
               on "Triple D,"
            but I'm telling you,

162
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:14,339
               we are talking
              about real deal.

163
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:16,508
 They hand-make their tortillas,
     they make all their salsas.

164
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:19,211
     It's all about as authentic
              as you can find.

165
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:21,079
          Carne Adovada's ready.

166
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:22,514
        Today I'm having
       the Carne Adovada.

167
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:26,084
       The pork is local.
   It's fresh. It's delicious.

168
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:28,787
                Our next dish
      is gonna be Carne Adovada.

169
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:30,055
        RICE:
It's a pork shoulder.

170
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:33,058
I salt this the night before,
 and we tied it up.

171
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,526
                So, trust it
       so it doesn't fall apart.

172
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:37,162
We're gonna be adding
toasted and ground cumin.

173
00:06:37,164 --> 00:06:39,197
      -Old-school methods.
        -Maximum flavor.

174
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,400
And then we have a little bit
of the Spanish paprika --

175
00:06:41,402 --> 00:06:45,036
smoked pimenton -- tomatoes,
and then bay leaves,

176
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:47,406
     some onion,
     and garlic.

177
00:06:47,408 --> 00:06:50,776
     Cerveza...
that we love so much.

178
00:06:50,778 --> 00:06:53,178
And some jalapeño, as well.
 Ready for the oven.

179
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,947
           Here we go.
-How long are we gonna cook off?

180
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:58,250
For about two and a half hours
       at 350.

181
00:06:58,252 --> 00:06:59,351
                    Okay.
           What are we into now?

182
00:06:59,353 --> 00:07:00,919
We're making guajillo salsa.

183
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:04,156
       So guajillo, chili àrbol,
                 and garlic?

184
00:07:04,158 --> 00:07:06,525
And letting it steep
  for five minutes.

185
00:07:06,527 --> 00:07:09,961
Okay. I'm gonna puree
the guajillo chilies.

186
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:11,496
Add in the chicken borth.

187
00:07:11,498 --> 00:07:14,466
Add a little bit of salt.

188
00:07:14,468 --> 00:07:16,401
Strain the guajillo chili.

189
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:17,636
                    Okay.

190
00:07:17,638 --> 00:07:20,439
This is one of the mother
sauces for Mexican cuisine.

191
00:07:20,441 --> 00:07:23,108
Sauté it with some airomatics
and a little bit of olive oil.

192
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:26,178
 Bay leaves, onion,
     and garlic.

193
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,813
 We're gonna add in
      the cumin

194
00:07:27,815 --> 00:07:30,015
    and the Mexican oregano.
           -Oh, yeah.

195
00:07:30,017 --> 00:07:32,050
 It's very different
than the Italian oregano.

196
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:33,752
              Twice the flavor.

197
00:07:33,754 --> 00:07:35,353
We're adding the guajillo.

198
00:07:35,355 --> 00:07:38,557
   Let this simmer
for about 10, 15 minutes.

199
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:41,793
A little kosher salt,
and it's ready to go.

200
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:46,798
This is the Carne Adovada,
   ready to serve.

201
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,167
             She just threw away
 the dental floss of Flavortown.

202
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:50,902
 Gonna get a little
of chili sauce on top this.

203
00:07:50,904 --> 00:07:52,037
                    Okay.
                   Get it.

204
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:54,272
You have just a little bit
    of cilantro.

205
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:56,341
And some homemade tortillas.

206
00:07:56,343 --> 00:07:57,476
                I don't know
             if I should eat it

207
00:07:57,478 --> 00:07:59,044
              or take a picture
                  with it.

208
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:07,886
You have good tortilla
technique, so that's important.

209
00:08:07,888 --> 00:08:09,488
           I've got a good hold.

210
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:10,789
       <i> Bien?</i>

211
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:12,457
                 I feel like
             I need my passport.

212
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:14,125
     It's a simple Mexican dish.

213
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:16,127
          It's not over-the-top.
              It's pork roast,

214
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:18,730
        guajillo chili de àrbol,
          simple rice and beans,

215
00:08:18,732 --> 00:08:22,501
       great handmade tortillas.

216
00:08:22,503 --> 00:08:25,804
    Everything's just what it is
             in the great form.

217
00:08:25,806 --> 00:08:28,206
          That's the difference.

218
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,609
         -Carne Adovada?
       -It's so tender --

219
00:08:30,611 --> 00:08:32,978
  just simply paired with rice
    and beans and a tortilla.

220
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,179
       It's all you need.

221
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:36,915
  -Like, everything is perfect.
         -Every detail.

222
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:39,584
         But it remains,
 nevertheless, fully accessible.

223
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:41,753
     That's what I want my shirt
                   to say!

224
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:42,954
   You're gonna leave with one

225
00:08:42,956 --> 00:08:44,523
  of the best food experiences
        you've ever had.

226
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:46,291
         And if you've ever been
            to a Mexican market,

227
00:08:46,293 --> 00:08:48,693
      you understand the kinetic
         energy that's going on.

228
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:50,161
    It just has that feeling.
           -Thank you.

229
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:51,630
      And the food is fantastic.

230
00:08:51,632 --> 00:08:52,797
           -Thank you.
          -Outstanding.

231
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:55,033
        Yay!

232
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:57,302
   Coming up, in Islamorada...
Okay.

233
00:08:57,304 --> 00:08:59,237
...a Florida Keys institution...

234
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:01,339
     Wow, buddy.
 What a great place.

235
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:03,542
  ...serving up their own brand
           of comfort.

236
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:05,610
That finishes it off perfect.
        Mmm!

241
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:19,558
  you got to check out Pier 23.
     You're in New Orleans?

242

       Yeah, you're going
         to Casamento's.

243
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:23,995
   If you're in New York City,

        where do you go?

246
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,000
  Exactly -- The Green Turtle.

247
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:33,872
      Everybody in the Keys
     knows the Green Turtle.

248

       We have our famous

  The food here is outstanding.

250
00:09:37,477 --> 00:09:39,878
        This restaurant,
       it's just an icon.

251
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,347
       It opened in 1947.

252
00:09:42,349 --> 00:09:45,083
     FIERI: By local legends
    Sid and Roxie Siderious.

253
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:48,086
      But has gone through
    a few other owners since.

254
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,589
           And today,
   general manager Chris Frank

255
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,157
      and Chef Ryan Wisely

256
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:56,428
    are keeping that classic
  Green Turtle tradition alive.

257
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:57,796
     What's nice
is that people come in,

258
00:09:57,798 --> 00:10:00,231
and they've been here
50 years ago, 40 years ago,

259
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:02,267
then the generations
 just pass on down.

260
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:04,936
   And they're still grabbing
 the original house speciality.

261
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,072
  Turtle chowder in the window.

262
00:10:07,074 --> 00:10:09,474
    It's made with Louisiana
        snapping turtle.

263
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:12,410
           It's loaded
    with a lot of vegetables.

264
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:14,579
        -It's delicious.
  -I got to be honest with you,

265
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:16,581
I don't know that most people
have ever had turtle.

266
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,083
               Then this will
         be very "fall apart-y."

267
00:10:18,085 --> 00:10:19,751
      -Very "fall apart-y"?
            -Correct.

268
00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:21,119
      You know
that's actually not a word?

269
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:23,788
           -It's not.
             -It is
  in the Flavortown dictionary.

270
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:24,956
How are we gonna make it?

271
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,691
     First we're gonna start off
               with our meat.

272
00:10:26,693 --> 00:10:28,293
               We're gonna get
           our steam kettle hot.

273
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:30,095
 Got to love having
 that steam kettle.

274
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:33,531
   Add a little olive oil. Meat.
             Montreal seasoning.

275
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:35,767
The meat's seared up.
Now the mirepoix part goes down?

276
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:38,203
            Correct. Sweat these
            till they're tender.

277
00:10:38,205 --> 00:10:40,639
       Next up, crushed tomatoes
              from California,

278
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:41,806
             Italian seasoning.

279
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,642
  A little garlic.

280
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:46,845
              Cajun seasoning,
             Montreal seasoning,

281
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:48,213
                tomato juice.

282
00:10:48,215 --> 00:10:49,581
           -All right.
      -A little beef base.

283
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:51,016
                Sherry wine.

284
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:52,784
Worcestershire sauce.
                 That's the one.

285
00:10:52,786 --> 00:10:55,587
  We're gonna add our house-made
               chicken stock.

286
00:10:55,589 --> 00:10:58,490
             -Okay.
   -Diced Red Bliss potatoes.

287
00:10:58,492 --> 00:10:59,758
And last but not least.

288
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,059
               Our dark roux.

289
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:03,028
That is chocolate, baby.

290
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,462
How long are we gonna
 let this cook down?

291
00:11:04,464 --> 00:11:05,563
            We're gonna bring it
                 to a boil,

292
00:11:05,565 --> 00:11:07,499
             then let it simmer
            for about two hours.

293
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:08,800
      By then,
  this turtle meat

294
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:10,301
     should be super tender.
            -Correct.

295
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:11,770
         -And not gamey?
            -Promise.

296
00:11:11,772 --> 00:11:13,204
        Okay.

297
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:14,873
                     ♪

298
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:24,082
        Mmm.

299
00:11:24,084 --> 00:11:28,086
It's a super luxurious beef
stew, is what it tastes like.

300
00:11:28,088 --> 00:11:31,322
     Your mix --
the seasoning, the salt,

301
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:33,224
      the roux,
     the potato,

302
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:35,660
    the mirepoix
cooked down, spot on.

303
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:40,098
              And add a little
      ghost-pepper sherry to it.

304
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,267
      Oh, yeah.
   I'm into this.

305
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:43,968
      Ah, dude!

306
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,503
You have to make sure

307
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:47,038
that the ghost pepper
   sherry's there.

308
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,407
That finishes it off
      perfect.

309
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:51,142
      Mmm. Mmm.

310
00:11:53,013 --> 00:11:55,213
  Turtle chowder in the window.

311
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,382
It's very meaty, very flavorful.

312
00:11:57,384 --> 00:12:00,085
  That's just an unusual dish,
   but I highly recommend it.

313
00:12:02,422 --> 00:12:05,790
       Pork belly's ready
         in the window.

314
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:08,393
 WOMAN: Every restaurant in town
    is a seafood restaurant.

315
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:10,795
         Conch fritters
     and fried-fish baskets.

316
00:12:10,797 --> 00:12:13,865
 But coming to the Green Turtle,
you can get a variety of things.

317
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:15,734
   Lots of good comfort food.

318
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:18,002
 Bacon Wrap Love, in the window.

319
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:21,306
 The Bacon Wrap Love is sinful.

320
00:12:21,308 --> 00:12:23,174
   MAN: It's a wonderful piece
         of meatloaf --

321
00:12:23,176 --> 00:12:24,676
    mushrooms on the inside.

322
00:12:24,678 --> 00:12:30,515
      It's wrapped in bacon
  with a decadent sauce on top.

323
00:12:30,517 --> 00:12:31,750
             Let's get in this.
             What are we making?

324
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:34,252
Our house-made bistro sauce
  for our meatloaf.

325
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,520
                Let's do it!

326
00:12:35,522 --> 00:12:37,922
We're gonna start off
with a cola, raisins,

327
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:40,291
  crushed tomatoes,
  granulated sugar.

328
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:41,326
                    Okay.

329
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:43,962
 Water. Kosher salt.

330
00:12:43,964 --> 00:12:45,230
Ground black pepper.

331
00:12:45,232 --> 00:12:46,331
               A ton of that.

332
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:47,565
 Granulated garlic.

333
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:48,666
 Italian seasoning.

334
00:12:48,668 --> 00:12:50,335
   Worcestershire.

335
00:12:50,337 --> 00:12:51,369
                  Oh, boy,
              give me the soy.

336
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:53,004
And soy, soy, oh, boy.

337
00:12:53,006 --> 00:12:54,939
Then an exact amount
    of Sriracha.

338
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:56,107
 right about there.

339
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:58,176
                 Lay it on.
 Mix it up, and let it simmer...

340
00:12:58,178 --> 00:12:59,644
For about 45 minutes

341
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:01,279
   and then hit it
with the immersion blender.

342
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:02,547
                   Dig it.

343
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:04,115
            Now we're gonna make
                the meatloaf.

344
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,584
This is ground pork-and-beef
      mixture.

345
00:13:06,586 --> 00:13:08,253
   We're gonna add
fresh chopped garlic,

346
00:13:08,255 --> 00:13:10,555
  red bell pepper,
sweet vidalia onion,

347
00:13:10,557 --> 00:13:12,991
chopped green bell pepper.
                         Okay.

348
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:14,859
   Two large eggs.
   Worcestershire.

349
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:16,394
                You guys like
your Worcestershire around here.

350
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:18,830
      Sure do.
 Panko breadcrumbs,

351
00:13:18,832 --> 00:13:22,033
     whole milk,
  ground coriander,

352
00:13:22,035 --> 00:13:23,701
 parsley and chives,

353
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:25,436
  salt, pepper.
                    All right.

354
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:27,872
Now here's where the love
      comes in.

355
00:13:27,874 --> 00:13:29,574
             I'm excited to see
       what's gonna happen here.

356
00:13:29,576 --> 00:13:32,310
     All right.
Now we weave the bacon.

357
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:33,411
 Now we're gonna add
  our meat mixture,

358
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:35,313
 make a little vein
   in the meatloaf

359
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,816
for our bistro sauce
with cremini mushrooms.

360
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:39,284
        All that flavor -- okay.

361
00:13:39,286 --> 00:13:40,885
And cover it with the rest
    of the meat.

362
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:42,587
Now we're gonna thatch it
       again.

363
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:44,189
                 I like it.

364
00:13:44,191 --> 00:13:45,557
   Flip her over.

365
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:47,091
         In the oven, what temp?

366
00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:49,727
350 for about 45 minutes.

367
00:13:49,729 --> 00:13:51,963
  Just coats it in the bacon fat
                as it cooks.

368
00:13:51,965 --> 00:13:53,331
                  And then
            when it comes out...

369
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,799
Let it cool down, slice it.

370
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:56,167
               What the sauce
               we put on top?

371
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:58,636
  Ketchup and house
bistro sauce mixture.
                      I like it.

372
00:13:58,638 --> 00:14:01,105
 Finish in the oven,
   then serve it.

373
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:02,740
      -Let's see it, buddy.
           -All right.

374
00:14:02,742 --> 00:14:05,877
Creamy mashed potatoes,
portabella mushroom gravy,

375
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:08,012
   butter braise green beans,

376
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:11,316
    and for the grand finale,
        Bacon Wrap Love.

377
00:14:11,318 --> 00:14:13,017
  Enjoy, my friend.

378
00:14:15,956 --> 00:14:19,357
               Mmm. It's nice
           and light and tender.

379
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,492
            That bistro sauce --
              really dynamite.

380
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:25,930
        You got this old-school,
           nostalgic reputation,

381
00:14:25,932 --> 00:14:27,332
            and you're thinking,
           "That's what you have

382
00:14:27,334 --> 00:14:29,467
        in an old-school place,"
           is you have meatloaf.

383
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:31,636
                  But then
           you "sophistifunk" it

384
00:14:31,638 --> 00:14:35,006
                and stuff it
             with the mushrooms.

385
00:14:35,008 --> 00:14:36,441
                  Dynamite.

386
00:14:36,443 --> 00:14:38,509
 I mean, it's wrapped in bacon,
          first of all,

387
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:40,144
   so stop right there, right?

388
00:14:40,146 --> 00:14:42,113
       Bacon Wrapped Love.

389
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:43,648
I love the mushrooms
   folded into it,

390
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,483
and it's just awesome.

391
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:47,619
  Can I get some more meatloaf
      to the line, please?

392
00:14:47,621 --> 00:14:49,687
  MAN: The romance is palatable
           in the food

393
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:51,589
   and in the atmosphere here.

394
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:53,591
                 Wow, buddy.
             What a great place.

395
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:54,659
             Really nicely done.

396
00:14:54,661 --> 00:14:56,561
Appreciate that, Chef.
                            Mmm!

397
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:01,065
            Up next,
   a Stockton California Cafe.

398
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:02,834
 You've knocked this
  out of the park.

399
00:15:02,836 --> 00:15:05,136
       ...giving beignets
      a morning makeover...

400
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:06,738
That's a country breakfast
if I've ever seen it.

401
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,373
        ...and beefing up
      their signature dish.

402
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:09,908
   If you weren't
in the crepe business,

403
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,809
I would tell you to get
into the barbecue business.

404
00:15:14,214 --> 00:15:20,852
                     ♪

405
00:15:20,854 --> 00:15:22,921
            I'm here
    at Stockton, California,

406
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:24,455
      just a couple blocks
         down the street

407
00:15:24,457 --> 00:15:26,224
       from the University
         of the Pacific,

408
00:15:26,226 --> 00:15:27,892
        and this is known
      as the Miracle Mile.

409
00:15:27,894 --> 00:15:29,928
   And you can find just about
    every kind of restaurant

410
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,529
       and store down here
        that you'd expect

411
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:33,197
          and even some
      you wouldn't expect.

412
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,934
       This is the Midtown
       Creperie and Cafe.

413
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:41,172
             I need a Big Easy.
              Dixieland Crepe.

414
00:15:41,174 --> 00:15:42,373
           The crepes
     are out of this world.

415
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:43,775
              MAN:
    Crepe Brulée ready to go.

416
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:47,545
         Mmm. Wonderful.
    Everybody loves it here.

417
00:15:47,547 --> 00:15:50,682
             FIERI:
   Which is big, since owners
   Matthew and Melissa Grizzle

418
00:15:50,684 --> 00:15:52,850
      truly started cooking
          from scratch.

419
00:15:52,852 --> 00:15:54,319
            So, you guys weren't
     in the restaurant business?

420
00:15:54,321 --> 00:15:57,188
              -No.
          -Not at all.

421
00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:01,125
             FIERI:
 But that didn't stop them from
 seizing an opportunity in 2010.

422
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:02,894
            The crepe restaurant
           in town had closed...

423
00:16:02,896 --> 00:16:04,329
             -Right.
             -Right.

424
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:05,830
         ...and you just decided

425
00:16:05,832 --> 00:16:08,099
               Stockton needs
       another crepe restaurant.

426
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:10,401
      -That's what we did.
     -"That's what we did."

427
00:16:10,403 --> 00:16:13,204
 I like the menu. There are just
   interesting items on there

428
00:16:13,206 --> 00:16:15,273
       that you won't find
         anywhere else.

429
00:16:15,275 --> 00:16:17,208
        All righty, guys.
        We got Rex Crepe.

430
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:19,444
   MAN: It's got real tender,
          thin-sliced,

431
00:16:19,446 --> 00:16:20,945
  smoked tri-tip in the middle.

432
00:16:20,947 --> 00:16:24,983
         With asparagus
 and a basil-pesto cream sauce.

433
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:27,051
             That does not sound
 like any crepe I have ever had.

434
00:16:27,053 --> 00:16:28,686
      Absolutely delicious.

435
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:31,222
       -Let's get started.
  -So, we're gonna make our rub
        for our tri-tip.

436
00:16:31,224 --> 00:16:33,858
          -So, hit it.
    -We got our brown sugar,
          onion powder,

437
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,260
               garlic powder,
                pepper, salt.

438
00:16:36,262 --> 00:16:39,163
     -And a little paprika?
     -And a little paprika.

439
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:40,665
        And then rub our tri-tip
                    down.

440
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,033
How long is it gonna go
 in the smoker for?

441
00:16:42,035 --> 00:16:44,602
      225 for an hour and a half
           with applewood chips.

442
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:47,372
    Pull it out,
let it cool, slice it thin,

443
00:16:47,374 --> 00:16:49,607
and then it'll kind of
get reheated when it
goes into the crepe.

444
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:51,042
                  Exactly.
    Dig it.

445
00:16:51,044 --> 00:16:53,111
What are we making?
                We're making
       our classic crepe batter.

446
00:16:53,113 --> 00:16:55,079
             -Okay.
-So we've got our fat-free milk,

447
00:16:55,081 --> 00:16:58,016
      a splash of vegetable oil,
              our liquid eggs,

448
00:16:58,018 --> 00:16:59,250
           a little bit of salt.

449
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:00,518
   Nice measuring.

450
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,420
          And last but not least
      is your all-purpose flour.

451
00:17:02,422 --> 00:17:03,888
        Wait.

452
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,457
       <i> -That's</i> your lid?
        -This is my lid.

453
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:08,526
  FIERI: Oh, I'm so not standing
                   by you.

454
00:17:10,497 --> 00:17:15,366
Make sure you get the sides
and you got a nice consistency.

455
00:17:17,971 --> 00:17:19,470
This bad boy's done.

456
00:17:19,472 --> 00:17:21,205
                       Ow!
   [ Chuckles ]

457
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:23,574
       So, now
we've got to make our crepe.

458
00:17:23,576 --> 00:17:24,776
  Drop it on here.

459
00:17:24,778 --> 00:17:26,677
Drop it like it's...
         Drop it like it's hot.

460
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:28,312
     Thank you.

461
00:17:28,314 --> 00:17:32,216
Ooh, I like the little wooden
dowel Geppetto made for you.

462
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:35,019
                    Yes.
       Geppetto made a good one.

463
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:36,954
And then you bring out
your "Pirates of the
Caribbean" sword.

464
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:38,923
                   You do.
      And you flip this bad boy.

465
00:17:38,925 --> 00:17:40,625
   Nice and thin.
That's what we're looking for.

466
00:17:40,627 --> 00:17:41,726
Just a little brown.

467
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:43,294
             We're gonna flip it
                 back over,

468
00:17:43,296 --> 00:17:44,796
    just for 30 seconds more.
             -Okay.

469
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:46,431
     -Now we're gonna put it
            together.
           -All right.

470
00:17:46,433 --> 00:17:48,366
          We take our asparagus,
               and then we add

471
00:17:48,368 --> 00:17:50,334
               that wonderful,
      slow-smoked tri-tip to it.

472
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:52,804
       We're gonna put it
       on top right here.

473
00:17:52,806 --> 00:17:55,973
        -Lot of filling.
      -You want to be full.

474
00:17:55,975 --> 00:17:57,308
                There we are.

475
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,544
         And last but not least,
             basil-pesto sauce.

476
00:17:59,546 --> 00:18:00,678
       And that's the Rex Crepe.

477
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,046
And why do you call it
      the Rex?

478
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:04,482
        The Rex means "The King"
               in New Orleans.

479
00:18:04,484 --> 00:18:06,050
The Rex means "The King"?

480
00:18:13,126 --> 00:18:14,926
You've knocked this crepe
  out of the park.

481
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:17,328
     It's light,
got a great texture to it.

482
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:20,665
The basil cream sauce
     is spot-on.

483
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:23,768
I like the little inclusion
  of the asparagus.

484
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,169
   If you weren't
in the crepe business,

485
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:27,071
I would tell you to get
into the barbecue business.

486
00:18:27,073 --> 00:18:28,739
That's competition tri-tip,
    right there.

487
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:30,708
       This is
a really good crepe.

488
00:18:32,178 --> 00:18:33,878
        Mmm.

489
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,046
           Rex Crepe!

490
00:18:35,048 --> 00:18:36,881
         It's delicious.
   They're tri-tip's amazing.

491
00:18:36,883 --> 00:18:38,883
You get that nice smokey
flavor coming through.

492
00:18:38,885 --> 00:18:40,351
  The crepe is nice and fluffy.

493
00:18:40,353 --> 00:18:41,586
         Big Easy Crepe.

494
00:18:41,588 --> 00:18:43,554
             Had you had crepes
before you came to the Creperie?

495
00:18:43,556 --> 00:18:44,989
I have in New Orleans.

496
00:18:44,991 --> 00:18:47,625
         And how do their crepes
                  compare?

497
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:49,927
I feel like I'm back
    in Louisiana.

498
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:51,262
             FIERI:
     And that's no accident.

499
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:52,763
        The owners' love
         of New Orleans

500
00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:54,332
 is stamped all over this joint.

501
00:18:54,334 --> 00:18:56,667
 You've got the nice
French Quarter vibe going on.

502
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:58,436
               Oh, that patio
            out there, for sure.

503
00:18:58,438 --> 00:19:00,905
    Plus, they're serving up
       a Big Easy classic

504
00:19:00,907 --> 00:19:02,507
  with their own added flavor.

505
00:19:02,509 --> 00:19:03,975
            MELISSA:
      Beignets & Gravy up.

506
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:06,010
     People aren't expecting
      a country-type gravy

507
00:19:06,012 --> 00:19:08,412
          to be placed
     over a French beignet.

508
00:19:08,414 --> 00:19:09,814
                We're making
             our beignet batter.

509
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:12,817
  So we start it off with yeast.
           We add our hot water.

510
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:14,352
    So, not just
  dry active yeast.

511
00:19:14,354 --> 00:19:16,120
      We've got
some real live yeast.

512
00:19:16,122 --> 00:19:18,923
               Yes. You put in
              evaporating milk,

513
00:19:18,925 --> 00:19:21,092
                soybean oil,
           a little bit of salt,

514
00:19:21,094 --> 00:19:23,060
                  and then
           you've got four eggs.

515
00:19:23,062 --> 00:19:24,662
        Okay.

516
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:27,265
       And then you start adding
   your flour, little by little,

517
00:19:27,267 --> 00:19:29,033
        get it all incorporated.

518
00:19:29,035 --> 00:19:30,768
                  And then
        we're gonna roll it out.

519
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:31,969
    Get after it.

520
00:19:31,971 --> 00:19:34,639
        You want it not too soft
              and not too firm.

521
00:19:34,641 --> 00:19:37,775
             Now we roll it out,
            cut it into squares,

522
00:19:37,777 --> 00:19:39,210
                just like so.

523
00:19:39,212 --> 00:19:40,378
         They go in the freezer.

524
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,812
So they don't proof at all.
     All right.

525
00:19:41,814 --> 00:19:43,247
                We're making
             our country gravy.

526
00:19:43,249 --> 00:19:44,815
                So we've got
               our whole milk,

527
00:19:44,817 --> 00:19:47,385
            rub -- sage, pepper,
               little salt --

528
00:19:47,387 --> 00:19:50,021
   and we cooked off our sausage
               and our bacon.

529
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:52,423
               Come to a boil.
And then it'll just reduce down,

530
00:19:52,425 --> 00:19:53,691
               and you've got
             your country gravy.

531
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:55,826
   And then we fry
    the beignets.

532
00:19:55,828 --> 00:19:58,362
              Two nice beignets
is what you get with your order.

533
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:00,965
And then give it some good gravy
                  on there.

534
00:20:00,967 --> 00:20:02,700
                Here we are.

535
00:20:04,771 --> 00:20:07,738
Nice and light and fluffy.
Tender, not overcooked.

536
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:11,742
   Gravy's creamy,
  not over-salted.

537
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:13,511
Sage and gravy go together.

538
00:20:13,513 --> 00:20:15,413
  A lot of sausage,
   a lot of bacon.

539
00:20:15,415 --> 00:20:17,782
That's a country breakfast
if I've ever seen it.

540
00:20:17,784 --> 00:20:21,319
             We got
      two Beignets & Gravy.

541
00:20:21,321 --> 00:20:23,754
      I would never have it
       on biscuits again.

542
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:26,123
         The perfect combination
             of sweet and salty.

543
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,825
   Just something new to try.

544
00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:29,360
            MELISSA:
      Beignets. Jambalaya.

545
00:20:29,362 --> 00:20:31,696
       -I love this place.
    -I'm glad you enjoyed it.

546
00:20:31,698 --> 00:20:33,831
        It's refreshing.

547
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:37,301
   Excellent job.
    Really nice.

548
00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:40,371
      So, was that another
  righteous road trip or what?

549
00:20:40,373 --> 00:20:42,740
      But don't you worry,
    we got plenty more joints

550
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,442
 to find all over this country.

551
00:20:44,444 --> 00:20:46,077
         I'll be looking
        for you next week

552
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:48,346
     on "Diners, Drive-Ins,
           and Dives."

553
00:20:48,348 --> 00:20:50,982
   How many people
   take it to go?

554
00:20:50,984 --> 00:20:53,918
         A day, a week, a month?

555
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,187
Talk about interesting stuff.
I'm just trying to eat.

556
00:20:56,189 --> 00:20:58,889
          [ Laughter ]

1
00:00:01,268 --> 00:00:02,334
Hey, everybody.

2
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:03,802
I'm Guy Fieri,
  and we're rolling out

3
00:00:03,804 --> 00:00:06,105
looking for America's greatest
 diners, drive-ins, and dives.

4
00:00:06,107 --> 00:00:07,506
This trip...
     Let's do it.

5
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:09,274
...we're tackling tacos...

6
00:00:09,276 --> 00:00:11,443
I don't know if I should eat it
  or take a picture with it.

7
00:00:11,445 --> 00:00:13,779
...tri-tips...
That's competition tri-tip
  right there.

8
00:00:13,781 --> 00:00:15,514
...and a tasty island tradition.

9
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:17,850
Then you
    "sophistifunk" it.

10
00:00:17,852 --> 00:00:20,252
In Stockton, California...
       Ow!

11
00:00:20,254 --> 00:00:21,653
...a little New Orleans
   flavor...

12
00:00:21,655 --> 00:00:22,955
Get after it.

13
00:00:22,957 --> 00:00:24,857
...with a meaty take
   on the crepe.

14
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:27,159
That does not sound
 like any crepe I've ever had.

15
00:00:27,161 --> 00:00:28,627
In Islamorada, Florida...

16
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:30,729
Dude!
  ...a local icon...

17
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:32,464
I'm excited to see
  what's gonna happen here.

18
00:00:32,466 --> 00:00:34,800
...shelling out
  their legendary stew.

19
00:00:34,802 --> 00:00:37,369
I don't know that most
people have ever had turtle.

20
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:38,704
And in Oakland, California...

21
00:00:38,706 --> 00:00:39,705
Gorgeous.

22
00:00:39,707 --> 00:00:41,306
...a true taste of Mexico...

23
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:42,808
I feel like I need
    my passport.

24
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:46,011
...at the corner
 of Authentic and Outrageous.

25
00:00:46,013 --> 00:00:49,048
How did our bite taste?
    Tastes fantastic.

26
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:50,849
That's all right here,
   right now,

27
00:00:50,851 --> 00:00:53,485
on "Diners, Drive-ins,
   and Dives."

28
00:01:03,798 --> 00:01:06,398
So, you know that when
  you're enjoying a meal

29
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,666
it's not just the food
   you're eating,

30
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:09,034
it's the experience
   you're having.

31
00:01:09,036 --> 00:01:11,070
You want a real-deal
  pizza experience,

32
00:01:11,072 --> 00:01:12,438
you're in a pizza parlor.

33
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,406
You want to have sausage
 and beer, you're in a hofbrau.

34
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:16,008
You're looking
  for some authentic,

35
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:18,544
real-deal Mexican food,
 where do you find yourself?

36
00:01:18,546 --> 00:01:20,212
How about an open market?

37
00:01:20,214 --> 00:01:22,848
So I'm here in Oakland,
 California, in Old Oakland,

38
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:24,516
to check out the real deal.

39
00:01:24,518 --> 00:01:26,285
This is Cosecha.

40
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:31,757
Here you go,
    pico de gallo.

41
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,560
I've been to, like, every
type of Mexican restaurant,

42
00:01:34,562 --> 00:01:36,962
and, by far,
 Cosecha's the best.

43
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:38,163
Four tacos all day?

44
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:40,499
Dominica is truly the nicest,

45
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:43,135
most engaging chef in Oakland
    that I know of.

46
00:01:43,137 --> 00:01:46,371
And Dominica Rice earned
 those chops working in kitchens

47
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:49,441
from San Fran to Manhattan
  to Mexico City...

48
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:50,776
I got it, I got it.

49
00:01:50,778 --> 00:01:52,077
...before setting up shop

50
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,714
in a nearly vacant
  marketplace in 2011.

51
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:58,083
When people started to realize
   how good her food was,

52
00:01:58,085 --> 00:02:01,253
how authentic it was,
she really filled this place up.

53
00:02:01,255 --> 00:02:03,055
A revival happened,
 which was great.

54
00:02:03,057 --> 00:02:05,157
What kind
 of Mexican restaurant is it?

55
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:07,025
We're doing
Oakland Mexican food.

56
00:02:07,027 --> 00:02:09,361
This type of cooking
has always been in California.

57
00:02:09,363 --> 00:02:10,929
But it's her own twist
   on the taco

58
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:12,764
that's got folks
  filling this joint.

59
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:15,734
Fish tacos, shrimp tacos,
  pork belly tacos.

60
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:17,736
We have two orders
   of pork belly.

61
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:21,607
Amazing, juicy,
  succulent, nom nom,

62
00:02:21,609 --> 00:02:24,443
pork belly tacos.
    Yeah!

63
00:02:24,445 --> 00:02:26,945
Get me into it.
This is skin-on pork belly.

64
00:02:26,947 --> 00:02:28,413
Where'd you get all
    the earthen-ware?

65
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:31,316
I have them come in
from Mexico that we
have custom made for us,

66
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:33,185
and then the other half
comes in from Spain.

67
00:02:33,187 --> 00:02:34,453
Gorgeous.
     Rumor is

68
00:02:34,455 --> 00:02:36,255
that Alice Waters
   comes in and eats --

69
00:02:36,257 --> 00:02:38,590
Oh, yeah.
One of the most important...
     Amazing woman.

70
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:41,026
...woman chefs in the world,
  yeah.

71
00:02:41,028 --> 00:02:42,761
- Salt it, and that's it?
   -That's it.

72
00:02:42,763 --> 00:02:45,564
And we let that marinate
  overnight.

73
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:48,066
We're gonna start
to prepare the achiote paste

74
00:02:48,068 --> 00:02:49,234
for the pork belly.

75
00:02:49,236 --> 00:02:51,203
Whole garlic, kosher salt.

76
00:02:51,205 --> 00:02:53,639
- So, you got a nice
 little paste out of that.
    -Yes.

77
00:02:53,641 --> 00:02:56,608
And then we just add the achiote
paste, which is annatto seed.

78
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:00,245
Beautiful red color.
And we're breaking this up.

79
00:03:00,247 --> 00:03:02,181
We're ready to add
  the citrus.

80
00:03:02,183 --> 00:03:04,416
Oh, gracias.
   I'll load the cannon.

81
00:03:04,418 --> 00:03:07,753
Lemon and lime and
a little bit of orange juice.

82
00:03:07,755 --> 00:03:12,357
So, take a little bit
of the achiote paste,

83
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:14,159
we're gonna rub this
 on both sides.

84
00:03:14,161 --> 00:03:15,727
And you're doing everything
     authentic.

85
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:17,596
It's the whole enchilada,
    no pun intended.

86
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:18,964
So, we're gonna add --

87
00:03:18,966 --> 00:03:22,267
The Mexican mirepoix of
 jalapeños, onions, and garlic.

88
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:24,603
Garlic, exactly.
  Here we go.

89
00:03:24,605 --> 00:03:27,506
I'm gonna top this off
with some nice cerveza.

90
00:03:27,508 --> 00:03:28,974
Okay.
     Covered?

91
00:03:28,976 --> 00:03:30,776
Yep.

92
00:03:30,778 --> 00:03:34,079
And place it into the oven
  at 350

93
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:36,148
for an hour
 and 45 minutes.

94
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,917
So, we're making
the pickled red onions

95
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:40,719
that we use on a lot
 of our tacos.

96
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:45,123
Kosher salt, jalapeños,
 chili de àrbol,

97
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:47,726
the Mexican
 piloncillo sugar.

98
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:48,794
Piloncillo sugar?

99
00:03:48,796 --> 00:03:50,529
So, this is cooked-down
 sugarcane juice.

100
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:52,664
So it has all the molasses.
Everything's together.

101
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,366
Bay Leaves.
   -Hibiscus?

102
00:03:54,368 --> 00:03:55,601
Yeah.
 The jamaica flower.

103
00:03:55,603 --> 00:03:57,035
Two cinnamon sticks.

104
00:03:57,037 --> 00:03:59,538
We're gonna add some water
  to that,

105
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:02,441
and then we're gonna add
 red wine vinegar.

106
00:04:02,443 --> 00:04:05,344
And I let that simmer
for about 10 to 15 minutes.

107
00:04:05,346 --> 00:04:08,513
I'll be over here.

108
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:10,549
Whoo! Press it down
 with the weights,

109
00:04:10,551 --> 00:04:12,551
and then let it sit for,
like, an hour and a half.

110
00:04:12,553 --> 00:04:13,619
Love it.

111
00:04:13,621 --> 00:04:15,120
Then we've chilled
 our pork belly --

112
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:16,555
And then I'll check the onions
    that we've made.

113
00:04:16,557 --> 00:04:18,790
- Yes. Yes, yes, yes.
  -That's important.

114
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:20,859
So, I'm gonna slice
 off a few portions.

115
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:23,462
Those will be fine.
  A little acid bite there.

116
00:04:23,464 --> 00:04:24,730
Then we salt them up.

117
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:26,131
And then into the non-stick.

118
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:27,566
- Yeah.
   -Sear 'em off.

119
00:04:27,568 --> 00:04:29,635
So, we make tortillas.

120
00:04:29,637 --> 00:04:31,637
That's, like, the most
  perfect hand-made tortilla.

121
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:33,038
They're made to order,

122
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,475
so the skin-on pork belly
I love, because it has that

123
00:04:36,477 --> 00:04:38,710
little bit
of that chicharrón crunch.

124
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:42,247
And we put a little bit
of the tomatillo salsa.

125
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:43,515
Pickled onion.

126
00:04:43,517 --> 00:04:46,685
You've outweighed the tortilla
    5:1 with the pork.

127
00:04:46,687 --> 00:04:50,389
Fresh sliced jalapeño,
and then a little cilantro.

128
00:04:50,391 --> 00:04:54,159
A little sprinkle of salt
and a little bit of lime.

129
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:55,894
Ready to roll.

130
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:01,900
The skin is so thin
  in that part of the belly

131
00:05:01,902 --> 00:05:02,968
it starts to crunch up

132
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,770
with a little bit
    of its own fat.

133
00:05:04,772 --> 00:05:06,038
It's quintessential

134
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,774
that you have the pickled onion
    inside of there.

135
00:05:08,776 --> 00:05:10,375
It's every aspect --
  the squeeze of the lemon,

136
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:11,543
the touch of the salt.

137
00:05:11,545 --> 00:05:13,145
For people
  right now that are saying,

138
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:17,449
"I wish I was there,"
   I'm doing this for you.

139
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:20,452
How did our bite taste?
    Tastes fantastic.

140
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:23,655
Two pork bellies up on 19.

141
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:26,825
These tacos are kind of
 an emotional experience for me.

142
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:29,628
Just perfectly crispy
   pieces of pork belly --

143
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,430
nice contrast
    with the red onion.

144
00:05:31,432 --> 00:05:34,099
Makes you feel like you're
 no longer in the Bay area.

145
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:36,168
You eat out
 of the little pottery dishes,

146
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,303
and you're thinking,
  "I'm in a Mexican market."

147
00:05:38,305 --> 00:05:40,005
Doesn't it feel like it?
  -Yeah, for sure.

148
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:41,940
You can actually
  smell the tortillas

149
00:05:41,942 --> 00:05:43,241
from about a block away,

150
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:45,610
so it's always
  luring you over here.

151
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:47,379
- But that's not all your tricks.
    -No.

152
00:05:47,381 --> 00:05:48,647
We have more.
  -I heard you got more.

153
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:50,749
- Carne Adovada?
   -Carne Adovada?

154
00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:52,484
<i> -Sí.</i>
- You can't miss this.

155
00:05:52,486 --> 00:05:53,952
I'll see you
    in a little bit.

156
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:56,254
I'm gonna have one more taco
   just for us, though.

157
00:05:56,256 --> 00:05:57,756
--Come back.

158
00:06:04,732 --> 00:06:07,766
Welcome back. We're at Cosecha
   in Oakland, California.

159
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:10,435
Now, I know you think
  you've seen enough tacos

160
00:06:10,437 --> 00:06:12,237
on "Triple D,"
   but I'm telling you,

161
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:14,339
we are talking
    about real deal.

162
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:16,508
They hand-make their tortillas,
  they make all their salsas.

163
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:19,211
It's all about as authentic
    as you can find.

164
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:21,079
Carne Adovada's ready.

165
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:22,514
Today I'm having
  the Carne Adovada.

166
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:26,084
The pork is local.
 It's fresh. It's delicious.

167
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:28,787
Our next dish
  is gonna be Carne Adovada.

168
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:30,055
It's a pork shoulder.

169
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:33,058
I salt this the night before,
 and we tied it up.

170
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,526
So, trust it
  so it doesn't fall apart.

171
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:37,162
We're gonna be adding
toasted and ground cumin.

172
00:06:37,164 --> 00:06:39,197
- Old-school methods.
  -Maximum flavor.

173
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,400
And then we have a little bit
of the Spanish paprika --

174
00:06:41,402 --> 00:06:45,036
smoked pimenton -- tomatoes,
and then bay leaves,

175
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:47,406
some onion,
  and garlic.

176
00:06:47,408 --> 00:06:50,776
Cerveza...
that we love so much.

177
00:06:50,778 --> 00:06:53,178
And some jalapeño, as well.
 Ready for the oven.

178
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,947
Here we go.
- How long are we gonna cook off?

179
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:58,250
For about two and a half hours
  at 350.

180
00:06:58,252 --> 00:06:59,351
Okay.
   What are we into now?

181
00:06:59,353 --> 00:07:00,919
We're making guajillo salsa.

182
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:04,156
So guajillo, chili àrbol,
     and garlic?

183
00:07:04,158 --> 00:07:06,525
And letting it steep
 for five minutes.

184
00:07:06,527 --> 00:07:09,961
Okay. I'm gonna puree
the guajillo chilies.

185
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:11,496
Add in the chicken borth.

186
00:07:11,498 --> 00:07:14,466
Add a little bit of salt.

187
00:07:14,468 --> 00:07:16,401
Strain the guajillo chili.

188
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:17,636
Okay.

189
00:07:17,638 --> 00:07:20,439
This is one of the mother
sauces for Mexican cuisine.

190
00:07:20,441 --> 00:07:23,108
Sauté it with some airomatics
and a little bit of olive oil.

191
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:26,178
Bay leaves, onion,
  and garlic.

192
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,813
We're gonna add in
  the cumin

193
00:07:27,815 --> 00:07:30,015
and the Mexican oregano.
   -Oh, yeah.

194
00:07:30,017 --> 00:07:32,050
It's very different
than the Italian oregano.

195
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:33,752
Twice the flavor.

196
00:07:33,754 --> 00:07:35,353
We're adding the guajillo.

197
00:07:35,355 --> 00:07:38,557
Let this simmer
for about 10, 15 minutes.

198
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:41,793
A little kosher salt,
and it's ready to go.

199
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:46,798
This is the Carne Adovada,
 ready to serve.

200
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,167
She just threw away
 the dental floss of Flavortown.

201
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:50,902
Gonna get a little
of chili sauce on top this.

202
00:07:50,904 --> 00:07:52,037
Okay.
     Get it.

203
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:54,272
You have just a little bit
 of cilantro.

204
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:56,341
And some homemade tortillas.

205
00:07:56,343 --> 00:07:57,476
I don't know
    if I should eat it

206
00:07:57,478 --> 00:07:59,044
or take a picture
     with it.

207
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:07,886
You have good tortilla
technique, so that's important.

208
00:08:07,888 --> 00:08:09,488
I've got a good hold.

209
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:10,789
<i> Bien?</i>

210
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:12,457
I feel like
    I need my passport.

211
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:14,125
It's a simple Mexican dish.

212
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:16,127
It's not over-the-top.
    It's pork roast,

213
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:18,730
guajillo chili de àrbol,
   simple rice and beans,

214
00:08:18,732 --> 00:08:22,501
great handmade tortillas.

215
00:08:22,503 --> 00:08:25,804
Everything's just what it is
    in the great form.

216
00:08:25,806 --> 00:08:28,206
That's the difference.

217
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,609
- Carne Adovada?
  -It's so tender --

218
00:08:30,611 --> 00:08:32,978
just simply paired with rice
 and beans and a tortilla.

219
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,179
It's all you need.

220
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:36,915
- Like, everything is perfect.
   -Every detail.

221
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:39,584
But it remains,
 nevertheless, fully accessible.

222
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:41,753
That's what I want my shirt
     to say!

223
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:42,954
You're gonna leave with one

224
00:08:42,956 --> 00:08:44,523
of the best food experiences
  you've ever had.

225
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:46,291
And if you've ever been
   to a Mexican market,

226
00:08:46,293 --> 00:08:48,693
you understand the kinetic
   energy that's going on.

227
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:50,161
It just has that feeling.
   -Thank you.

228
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:51,630
And the food is fantastic.

229
00:08:51,632 --> 00:08:52,797
- Thank you.
   -Outstanding.

230
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:55,033
Yay!

231
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:57,302
Coming up, in Islamorada...
Okay.

232
00:08:57,304 --> 00:08:59,237
...a Florida Keys institution...

233
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:01,339
Wow, buddy.
 What a great place.

234
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:03,542
...serving up their own brand
   of comfort.

235
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:05,610
That finishes it off perfect.
  Mmm!

236
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:14,953
You got to love finding
  legendary restaurants

237
00:09:14,955 --> 00:09:16,087
in iconic locations.

238
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:17,489
Like,
 if you're in San Francisco,

239
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:19,558
you got to check out Pier 23.
  You're in New Orleans?

240
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,159
Yeah, you're going
   to Casamento's.

241
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:23,995
If you're in New York City,
 you're going to John's on 12th.

242
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:25,163
So, when you're in the Keys here

243
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:26,831
in Islamorada,
  where do you go?

244
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,000
Exactly -- The Green Turtle.

245
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:33,872
Everybody in the Keys
  knows the Green Turtle.

246
00:09:33,874 --> 00:09:36,207
We have our famous
  Barney fish sandwich.

247
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:37,475
The food here is outstanding.

248
00:09:37,477 --> 00:09:39,878
This restaurant,
  it's just an icon.

249
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,347
It opened in 1947.

250
00:09:42,349 --> 00:09:45,083
By local legends
 Sid and Roxie Siderious.

251
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:48,086
But has gone through
 a few other owners since.

252
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,589
And today,
 general manager Chris Frank

253
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,157
and Chef Ryan Wisely

254
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:56,428
are keeping that classic
 Green Turtle tradition alive.

255
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:57,796
What's nice
is that people come in,

256
00:09:57,798 --> 00:10:00,231
and they've been here
50 years ago, 40 years ago,

257
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:02,267
then the generations
 just pass on down.

258
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:04,936
And they're still grabbing
 the original house speciality.

259
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,072
Turtle chowder in the window.

260
00:10:07,074 --> 00:10:09,474
It's made with Louisiana
  snapping turtle.

261
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:12,410
It's loaded
 with a lot of vegetables.

262
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:14,579
- It's delicious.
 -I got to be honest with you,

263
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:16,581
I don't know that most people
have ever had turtle.

264
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,083
Then this will
   be very "fall apart-y."

265
00:10:18,085 --> 00:10:19,751
- Very "fall apart-y"?
   -Correct.

266
00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:21,119
You know
that's actually not a word?

267
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:23,788
- It's not.
    -It is
 in the Flavortown dictionary.

268
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:24,956
How are we gonna make it?

269
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,691
First we're gonna start off
    with our meat.

270
00:10:26,693 --> 00:10:28,293
We're gonna get
   our steam kettle hot.

271
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:30,095
Got to love having
 that steam kettle.

272
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:33,531
Add a little olive oil. Meat.
    Montreal seasoning.

273
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:35,767
The meat's seared up.
Now the mirepoix part goes down?

274
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:38,203
Correct. Sweat these
   till they're tender.

275
00:10:38,205 --> 00:10:40,639
Next up, crushed tomatoes
    from California,

276
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:41,806
Italian seasoning.

277
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,642
A little garlic.

278
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:46,845
Cajun seasoning,
    Montreal seasoning,

279
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:48,213
tomato juice.

280
00:10:48,215 --> 00:10:49,581
- All right.
  -A little beef base.

281
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:51,016
Sherry wine.

282
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:52,784
Worcestershire sauce.
     That's the one.

283
00:10:52,786 --> 00:10:55,587
We're gonna add our house-made
    chicken stock.

284
00:10:55,589 --> 00:10:58,490
- Okay.
 -Diced Red Bliss potatoes.

285
00:10:58,492 --> 00:10:59,758
And last but not least.

286
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,059
Our dark roux.

287
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:03,028
That is chocolate, baby.

288
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,462
How long are we gonna
 let this cook down?

289
00:11:04,464 --> 00:11:05,563
We're gonna bring it
     to a boil,

290
00:11:05,565 --> 00:11:07,499
then let it simmer
   for about two hours.

291
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:08,800
By then,
 this turtle meat

292
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:10,301
should be super tender.
   -Correct.

293
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:11,770
- And not gamey?
   -Promise.

294
00:11:11,772 --> 00:11:13,204
Okay.

295
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:24,082
Mmm.

296
00:11:24,084 --> 00:11:28,086
It's a super luxurious beef
stew, is what it tastes like.

297
00:11:28,088 --> 00:11:31,322
Your mix --
the seasoning, the salt,

298
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:33,224
the roux,
  the potato,

299
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:35,660
the mirepoix
cooked down, spot on.

300
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:40,098
And add a little
  ghost-pepper sherry to it.

301
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,267
Oh, yeah.
 I'm into this.

302
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:43,968
Ah, dude!

303
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,503
You have to make sure

304
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:47,038
that the ghost pepper
 sherry's there.

305
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,407
That finishes it off
  perfect.

306
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:51,142
Mmm. Mmm.

307
00:11:53,013 --> 00:11:55,213
Turtle chowder in the window.

308
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,382
It's very meaty, very flavorful.

309
00:11:57,384 --> 00:12:00,085
That's just an unusual dish,
 but I highly recommend it.

310
00:12:02,422 --> 00:12:05,790
Pork belly's ready
   in the window.

311
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:08,393
Every restaurant in town
 is a seafood restaurant.

312
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:10,795
Conch fritters
  and fried-fish baskets.

313
00:12:10,797 --> 00:12:13,865
But coming to the Green Turtle,
you can get a variety of things.

314
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:15,734
Lots of good comfort food.

315
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:18,002
Bacon Wrap Love, in the window.

316
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:21,306
The Bacon Wrap Love is sinful.

317
00:12:21,308 --> 00:12:23,174
It's a wonderful piece
   of meatloaf --

318
00:12:23,176 --> 00:12:24,676
mushrooms on the inside.

319
00:12:24,678 --> 00:12:30,515
It's wrapped in bacon
 with a decadent sauce on top.

320
00:12:30,517 --> 00:12:31,750
Let's get in this.
    What are we making?

321
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:34,252
Our house-made bistro sauce
 for our meatloaf.

322
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,520
Let's do it!

323
00:12:35,522 --> 00:12:37,922
We're gonna start off
with a cola, raisins,

324
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:40,291
crushed tomatoes,
 granulated sugar.

325
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:41,326
Okay.

326
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:43,962
Water. Kosher salt.

327
00:12:43,964 --> 00:12:45,230
Ground black pepper.

328
00:12:45,232 --> 00:12:46,331
A ton of that.

329
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:47,565
Granulated garlic.

330
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:48,666
Italian seasoning.

331
00:12:48,668 --> 00:12:50,335
Worcestershire.

332
00:12:50,337 --> 00:12:51,369
Oh, boy,
    give me the soy.

333
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:53,004
And soy, soy, oh, boy.

334
00:12:53,006 --> 00:12:54,939
Then an exact amount
 of Sriracha.

335
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:56,107
right about there.

336
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:58,176
Lay it on.
 Mix it up, and let it simmer...

337
00:12:58,178 --> 00:12:59,644
For about 45 minutes

338
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:01,279
and then hit it
with the immersion blender.

339
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:02,547
Dig it.

340
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:04,115
Now we're gonna make
    the meatloaf.

341
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,584
This is ground pork-and-beef
  mixture.

342
00:13:06,586 --> 00:13:08,253
We're gonna add
fresh chopped garlic,

343
00:13:08,255 --> 00:13:10,555
red bell pepper,
sweet vidalia onion,

344
00:13:10,557 --> 00:13:12,991
chopped green bell pepper.
       Okay.

345
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:14,859
Two large eggs.
 Worcestershire.

346
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:16,394
You guys like
your Worcestershire around here.

347
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:18,830
Sure do.
 Panko breadcrumbs,

348
00:13:18,832 --> 00:13:22,033
whole milk,
 ground coriander,

349
00:13:22,035 --> 00:13:23,701
parsley and chives,

350
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:25,436
salt, pepper.
     All right.

351
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:27,872
Now here's where the love
  comes in.

352
00:13:27,874 --> 00:13:29,574
I'm excited to see
  what's gonna happen here.

353
00:13:29,576 --> 00:13:32,310
All right.
Now we weave the bacon.

354
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:33,411
Now we're gonna add
 our meat mixture,

355
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:35,313
make a little vein
 in the meatloaf

356
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,816
for our bistro sauce
with cremini mushrooms.

357
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:39,284
All that flavor -- okay.

358
00:13:39,286 --> 00:13:40,885
And cover it with the rest
 of the meat.

359
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:42,587
Now we're gonna thatch it
  again.

360
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:44,189
I like it.

361
00:13:44,191 --> 00:13:45,557
Flip her over.

362
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:47,091
In the oven, what temp?

363
00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:49,727
350 for about 45 minutes.

364
00:13:49,729 --> 00:13:51,963
Just coats it in the bacon fat
    as it cooks.

365
00:13:51,965 --> 00:13:53,331
And then
   when it comes out...

366
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,799
Let it cool down, slice it.

367
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:56,167
What the sauce
    we put on top?

368
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:58,636
Ketchup and house
bistro sauce mixture.
      I like it.

369
00:13:58,638 --> 00:14:01,105
Finish in the oven,
 then serve it.

370
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:02,740
- Let's see it, buddy.
   -All right.

371
00:14:02,742 --> 00:14:05,877
Creamy mashed potatoes,
portabella mushroom gravy,

372
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:08,012
butter braise green beans,

373
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:11,316
and for the grand finale,
  Bacon Wrap Love.

374
00:14:11,318 --> 00:14:13,017
Enjoy, my friend.

375
00:14:15,956 --> 00:14:19,357
Mmm. It's nice
   and light and tender.

376
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,492
That bistro sauce --
    really dynamite.

377
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:25,930
You got this old-school,
   nostalgic reputation,

378
00:14:25,932 --> 00:14:27,332
and you're thinking,
   "That's what you have

379
00:14:27,334 --> 00:14:29,467
in an old-school place,"
   is you have meatloaf.

380
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:31,636
But then
   you "sophistifunk" it

381
00:14:31,638 --> 00:14:35,006
and stuff it
    with the mushrooms.

382
00:14:35,008 --> 00:14:36,441
Dynamite.

383
00:14:36,443 --> 00:14:38,509
I mean, it's wrapped in bacon,
   first of all,

384
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:40,144
so stop right there, right?

385
00:14:40,146 --> 00:14:42,113
Bacon Wrapped Love.

386
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:43,648
I love the mushrooms
 folded into it,

387
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,483
and it's just awesome.

388
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:47,619
Can I get some more meatloaf
  to the line, please?

389
00:14:47,621 --> 00:14:49,687
The romance is palatable
   in the food

390
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:51,589
and in the atmosphere here.

391
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:53,591
Wow, buddy.
    What a great place.

392
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:54,659
Really nicely done.

393
00:14:54,661 --> 00:14:56,561
Appreciate that, Chef.
       Mmm!

394
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:01,065
Up next,
 a Stockton California Cafe.

395
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:02,834
You've knocked this
 out of the park.

396
00:15:02,836 --> 00:15:05,136
...giving beignets
  a morning makeover...

397
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:06,738
That's a country breakfast
if I've ever seen it.

398
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,373
...and beefing up
  their signature dish.

399
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:09,908
If you weren't
in the crepe business,

400
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,809
I would tell you to get
into the barbecue business.

401
00:15:20,854 --> 00:15:22,921
I'm here
 at Stockton, California,

402
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:24,455
just a couple blocks
   down the street

403
00:15:24,457 --> 00:15:26,224
from the University
   of the Pacific,

404
00:15:26,226 --> 00:15:27,892
and this is known
  as the Miracle Mile.

405
00:15:27,894 --> 00:15:29,928
And you can find just about
 every kind of restaurant

406
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,529
and store down here
  that you'd expect

407
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:33,197
and even some
  you wouldn't expect.

408
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,934
This is the Midtown
  Creperie and Cafe.

409
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:41,172
I need a Big Easy.
    Dixieland Crepe.

410
00:15:41,174 --> 00:15:42,373
The crepes
  are out of this world.

411
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:43,775
Crepe Brulée ready to go.

412
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:47,545
Mmm. Wonderful.
 Everybody loves it here.

413
00:15:47,547 --> 00:15:50,682
Which is big, since owners
 Matthew and Melissa Grizzle

414
00:15:50,684 --> 00:15:52,850
truly started cooking
   from scratch.

415
00:15:52,852 --> 00:15:54,319
So, you guys weren't
  in the restaurant business?

416
00:15:54,321 --> 00:15:57,188
- No.
   -Not at all.

417
00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:01,125
But that didn't stop them from
 seizing an opportunity in 2010.

418
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:02,894
The crepe restaurant
   in town had closed...

419
00:16:02,896 --> 00:16:04,329
- Right.
    -Right.

420
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:05,830
...and you just decided

421
00:16:05,832 --> 00:16:08,099
Stockton needs
  another crepe restaurant.

422
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:10,401
- That's what we did.
  -"That's what we did."

423
00:16:10,403 --> 00:16:13,204
I like the menu. There are just
 interesting items on there

424
00:16:13,206 --> 00:16:15,273
that you won't find
   anywhere else.

425
00:16:15,275 --> 00:16:17,208
All righty, guys.
  We got Rex Crepe.

426
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:19,444
It's got real tender,
   thin-sliced,

427
00:16:19,446 --> 00:16:20,945
smoked tri-tip in the middle.

428
00:16:20,947 --> 00:16:24,983
With asparagus
 and a basil-pesto cream sauce.

429
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:27,051
That does not sound
 like any crepe I have ever had.

430
00:16:27,053 --> 00:16:28,686
Absolutely delicious.

431
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:31,222
- Let's get started.
 -So, we're gonna make our rub
  for our tri-tip.

432
00:16:31,224 --> 00:16:33,858
- So, hit it.
 -We got our brown sugar,
   onion powder,

433
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,260
garlic powder,
    pepper, salt.

434
00:16:36,262 --> 00:16:39,163
- And a little paprika?
  -And a little paprika.

435
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:40,665
And then rub our tri-tip
     down.

436
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,033
How long is it gonna go
 in the smoker for?

437
00:16:42,035 --> 00:16:44,602
225 for an hour and a half
   with applewood chips.

438
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:47,372
Pull it out,
let it cool, slice it thin,

439
00:16:47,374 --> 00:16:49,607
and then it'll kind of
get reheated when it
goes into the crepe.

440
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:51,042
Exactly.
 Dig it.

441
00:16:51,044 --> 00:16:53,111
What are we making?
    We're making
  our classic crepe batter.

442
00:16:53,113 --> 00:16:55,079
- Okay.
- So we've got our fat-free milk,

443
00:16:55,081 --> 00:16:58,016
a splash of vegetable oil,
    our liquid eggs,

444
00:16:58,018 --> 00:16:59,250
a little bit of salt.

445
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:00,518
Nice measuring.

446
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,420
And last but not least
  is your all-purpose flour.

447
00:17:02,422 --> 00:17:03,888
Wait.

448
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,457
<i> -That's</i> your lid?
  -This is my lid.

449
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:08,526
Oh, I'm so not standing
     by you.

450
00:17:10,497 --> 00:17:15,366
Make sure you get the sides
and you got a nice consistency.

451
00:17:17,971 --> 00:17:19,470
This bad boy's done.

452
00:17:19,472 --> 00:17:21,205
Ow!

453
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:23,574
So, now
we've got to make our crepe.

454
00:17:23,576 --> 00:17:24,776
Drop it on here.

455
00:17:24,778 --> 00:17:26,677
Drop it like it's...
   Drop it like it's hot.

456
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:28,312
Thank you.

457
00:17:28,314 --> 00:17:32,216
Ooh, I like the little wooden
dowel Geppetto made for you.

458
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:35,019
Yes.
  Geppetto made a good one.

459
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:36,954
And then you bring out
your "Pirates of the
Caribbean" sword.

460
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:38,923
You do.
  And you flip this bad boy.

461
00:17:38,925 --> 00:17:40,625
Nice and thin.
That's what we're looking for.

462
00:17:40,627 --> 00:17:41,726
Just a little brown.

463
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:43,294
We're gonna flip it
     back over,

464
00:17:43,296 --> 00:17:44,796
just for 30 seconds more.
    -Okay.

465
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:46,431
- Now we're gonna put it
   together.
   -All right.

466
00:17:46,433 --> 00:17:48,366
We take our asparagus,
    and then we add

467
00:17:48,368 --> 00:17:50,334
that wonderful,
  slow-smoked tri-tip to it.

468
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:52,804
We're gonna put it
  on top right here.

469
00:17:52,806 --> 00:17:55,973
- Lot of filling.
  -You want to be full.

470
00:17:55,975 --> 00:17:57,308
There we are.

471
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,544
And last but not least,
    basil-pesto sauce.

472
00:17:59,546 --> 00:18:00,678
And that's the Rex Crepe.

473
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,046
And why do you call it
  the Rex?

474
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:04,482
The Rex means "The King"
    in New Orleans.

475
00:18:04,484 --> 00:18:06,050
The Rex means "The King"?

476
00:18:13,126 --> 00:18:14,926
You've knocked this crepe
 out of the park.

477
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:17,328
It's light,
got a great texture to it.

478
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:20,665
The basil cream sauce
  is spot-on.

479
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:23,768
I like the little inclusion
 of the asparagus.

480
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,169
If you weren't
in the crepe business,

481
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:27,071
I would tell you to get
into the barbecue business.

482
00:18:27,073 --> 00:18:28,739
That's competition tri-tip,
 right there.

483
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:30,708
This is
a really good crepe.

484
00:18:32,178 --> 00:18:33,878
Mmm.

485
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,046
Rex Crepe!

486
00:18:35,048 --> 00:18:36,881
It's delicious.
 They're tri-tip's amazing.

487
00:18:36,883 --> 00:18:38,883
You get that nice smokey
flavor coming through.

488
00:18:38,885 --> 00:18:40,351
The crepe is nice and fluffy.

489
00:18:40,353 --> 00:18:41,586
Big Easy Crepe.

490
00:18:41,588 --> 00:18:43,554
Had you had crepes
before you came to the Creperie?

491
00:18:43,556 --> 00:18:44,989
I have in New Orleans.

492
00:18:44,991 --> 00:18:47,625
And how do their crepes
     compare?

493
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:49,927
I feel like I'm back
 in Louisiana.

494
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:51,262
And that's no accident.

495
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:52,763
The owners' love
   of New Orleans

496
00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:54,332
is stamped all over this joint.

497
00:18:54,334 --> 00:18:56,667
You've got the nice
French Quarter vibe going on.

498
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:58,436
Oh, that patio
   out there, for sure.

499
00:18:58,438 --> 00:19:00,905
Plus, they're serving up
  a Big Easy classic

500
00:19:00,907 --> 00:19:02,507
with their own added flavor.

501
00:19:02,509 --> 00:19:03,975
Beignets & Gravy up.

502
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:06,010
People aren't expecting
  a country-type gravy

503
00:19:06,012 --> 00:19:08,412
to be placed
  over a French beignet.

504
00:19:08,414 --> 00:19:09,814
We're making
    our beignet batter.

505
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:12,817
So we start it off with yeast.
   We add our hot water.

506
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:14,352
So, not just
 dry active yeast.

507
00:19:14,354 --> 00:19:16,120
We've got
some real live yeast.

508
00:19:16,122 --> 00:19:18,923
Yes. You put in
    evaporating milk,

509
00:19:18,925 --> 00:19:21,092
soybean oil,
   a little bit of salt,

510
00:19:21,094 --> 00:19:23,060
and then
   you've got four eggs.

511
00:19:23,062 --> 00:19:24,662
Okay.

512
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:27,265
And then you start adding
 your flour, little by little,

513
00:19:27,267 --> 00:19:29,033
get it all incorporated.

514
00:19:29,035 --> 00:19:30,768
And then
  we're gonna roll it out.

515
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:31,969
Get after it.

516
00:19:31,971 --> 00:19:34,639
You want it not too soft
    and not too firm.

517
00:19:34,641 --> 00:19:37,775
Now we roll it out,
   cut it into squares,

518
00:19:37,777 --> 00:19:39,210
just like so.

519
00:19:39,212 --> 00:19:40,378
They go in the freezer.

520
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,812
So they don't proof at all.
  All right.

521
00:19:41,814 --> 00:19:43,247
We're making
    our country gravy.

522
00:19:43,249 --> 00:19:44,815
So we've got
    our whole milk,

523
00:19:44,817 --> 00:19:47,385
rub -- sage, pepper,
    little salt --

524
00:19:47,387 --> 00:19:50,021
and we cooked off our sausage
    and our bacon.

525
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:52,423
Come to a boil.
And then it'll just reduce down,

526
00:19:52,425 --> 00:19:53,691
and you've got
    your country gravy.

527
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:55,826
And then we fry
 the beignets.

528
00:19:55,828 --> 00:19:58,362
Two nice beignets
is what you get with your order.

529
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:00,965
And then give it some good gravy
     on there.

530
00:20:00,967 --> 00:20:02,700
Here we are.

531
00:20:04,771 --> 00:20:07,738
Nice and light and fluffy.
Tender, not overcooked.

532
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:11,742
Gravy's creamy,
 not over-salted.

533
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:13,511
Sage and gravy go together.

534
00:20:13,513 --> 00:20:15,413
A lot of sausage,
 a lot of bacon.

535
00:20:15,415 --> 00:20:17,782
That's a country breakfast
if I've ever seen it.

536
00:20:17,784 --> 00:20:21,319
We got
  two Beignets & Gravy.

537
00:20:21,321 --> 00:20:23,754
I would never have it
  on biscuits again.

538
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:26,123
The perfect combination
    of sweet and salty.

539
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,825
Just something new to try.

540
00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:29,360
Beignets. Jambalaya.

541
00:20:29,362 --> 00:20:31,696
- I love this place.
 -I'm glad you enjoyed it.

542
00:20:31,698 --> 00:20:33,831
It's refreshing.

543
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:37,301
Excellent job.
 Really nice.

544
00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:40,371
So, was that another
 righteous road trip or what?

545
00:20:40,373 --> 00:20:42,740
But don't you worry,
 we got plenty more joints

546
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,442
to find all over this country.

547
00:20:44,444 --> 00:20:46,077
I'll be looking
  for you next week

548
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:48,346
on "Diners, Drive-Ins,
   and Dives."

549
00:20:48,348 --> 00:20:50,982
How many people
 take it to go?

550
00:20:50,984 --> 00:20:53,918
A day, a week, a month?

551
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,187
Talk about interesting stuff.
I'm just trying to eat.

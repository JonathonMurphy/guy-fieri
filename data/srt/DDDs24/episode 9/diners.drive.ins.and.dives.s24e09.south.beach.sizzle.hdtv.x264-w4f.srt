1
00:00:01,669 --> 00:00:03,135
         I'm Guy Fieri,
      and we're rolling out

2
00:00:03,137 --> 00:00:05,637
 looking for America's greatest
  diners, drive-ins, and dives.

3
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:07,072
          This trip...

4
00:00:07,074 --> 00:00:08,941
 Like I was getting ready to fly
      "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang."

5
00:00:08,943 --> 00:00:11,477
        we're hanging out
   in South Beach, Florida...

6
00:00:11,479 --> 00:00:12,644
     Fantastic.

7
00:00:12,646 --> 00:00:15,514
        ...taking a bite
 of their cosmopolitan cuisine.

8
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:17,282
         I'm really telling you,
               it's dynamite.

9
00:00:17,284 --> 00:00:19,818
             First,
     a real-deal taqueria...

10
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,220
                 This is not
              your first rodeo.

11
00:00:21,222 --> 00:00:23,122
       ...getting way back
         to the basics.

12
00:00:23,124 --> 00:00:24,823
               I've made a lot
         of tortillas in my day.

13
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:26,492
         I have never seen this.

14
00:00:26,494 --> 00:00:28,927
        Then an authentic
       German beer hall...

15
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:30,896
Will you be dressing in
any type of lederhosen?

16
00:00:30,898 --> 00:00:32,164
   ...cooking up the classics.

17
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:34,333
  This will not be
the last time you see me.

18
00:00:34,335 --> 00:00:35,901
  Plus, Mediterranean flavor...

19
00:00:35,903 --> 00:00:38,203
There's a lot going on
for one paella dish.

20
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:40,539
          ...served up
       at a hidden oasis.

21
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:43,609
I don't want to hear it,
but I'm almost speechless.

22
00:00:43,611 --> 00:00:44,309
     'sll

23
00:00:54,488 --> 00:00:56,221
   So, every year in February,

24
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:58,624
           I head down
     to South Beach, Miami,

25
00:00:58,626 --> 00:01:00,959
 for one of the most outrageous,
      over-the-top events.

26
00:01:00,961 --> 00:01:02,061
      It's actually called

27
00:01:02,063 --> 00:01:04,296
         the South Beach
      Wine & Food Festival.

28
00:01:04,298 --> 00:01:06,065
   This is where amazing chefs

29
00:01:06,067 --> 00:01:08,267
         and great fans
  come together for one weekend

30
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:10,302
        for a party that,
   well, you got to check out.

31
00:01:10,304 --> 00:01:12,604
 But just like any of my trips,
  I'm saying, "Where do I eat?

32
00:01:12,606 --> 00:01:13,839
         Where do I find
       the local's food?"

33
00:01:13,841 --> 00:01:15,174
   Well, this time I'm lucky,

34
00:01:15,176 --> 00:01:17,276
    'cause I'm right here on
  Collins Avenue in South Beach

35
00:01:17,278 --> 00:01:19,511
      to check out a joint
         called Taquiza.

36
00:01:19,513 --> 00:01:21,046
                     ♪

37
00:01:21,048 --> 00:01:24,650
 There's nobody else in town who
 puts that kind of craftsmanship

38
00:01:24,652 --> 00:01:27,019
    into what they're doing.
       -Two carne asadas.

39
00:01:27,021 --> 00:01:28,053
      I'm having everything
          on the menu.

40
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:29,354
       MAN: Asada camaron.

41
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:32,357
Get a little beach, get to swim,
      come grab some tacos.

42
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:34,827
     FIERI: Which is exactly
     the vibe restaurant vet

43
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:37,262
       Washington Charles
     and computer programmer

44
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:39,131
  Steve Santana were going for

45
00:01:39,133 --> 00:01:41,733
      when they transformed
  a closed-up restaurant space

46
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:43,936
            in 2014.

47
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:46,972
  We blew out this whole front
  door open, front window open.

48
00:01:46,974 --> 00:01:49,374
          It's like a food truck
                on steroids.

49
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:50,776
       FIERI: And they're
       pumping up the menu

50
00:01:50,778 --> 00:01:52,277
   by keeping things grounded.

51
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:54,580
         Try to keep it
    as authentic as possible.

52
00:01:54,582 --> 00:01:56,081
    Favorite item
    on the menu.

53
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:57,249
                Chips by far.

54
00:01:57,251 --> 00:01:59,251
   MAN #1: They're delicious,
         they're crispy,

55
00:01:59,253 --> 00:02:00,886
          they're still
       soft on the inside.

56
00:02:00,888 --> 00:02:02,321
    MAN #2: Totopos and guac.

57
00:02:02,323 --> 00:02:05,157
   They pair with a guacamole
     like unbelievably well.

58
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:08,127
Here we're gonna prepare
    the nixtamal,

59
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:10,295
which is a first step
   to making masa.

60
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:13,999
This is organic non-GMO
blue corn from Mexico.

61
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:15,501
                    Okay,
        so let's get after this.

62
00:02:15,503 --> 00:02:17,336
  Pickle and lime.
       Water.

63
00:02:17,338 --> 00:02:19,271
So, it's just gonna change
the pH a little bit.

64
00:02:19,273 --> 00:02:20,372
              Just so the skins
               will come off?

65
00:02:20,374 --> 00:02:21,573
        Yeah.

66
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:23,876
        I've only seen one place
    in the history of "Triple D"

67
00:02:23,878 --> 00:02:26,979
 that has made the nixtamal like
    this to make their own masa,

68
00:02:26,981 --> 00:02:30,282
     and that was in, believe it
          or not, New York City.

69
00:02:30,284 --> 00:02:32,017
              All right, so now
    we let this go for how long?

70
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:33,619
Five minutes, super quick.

71
00:02:33,621 --> 00:02:35,220
Then it soaks overnight.

72
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:38,123
           All right, so this is
               all of the corn

73
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:39,525
               after the skin
              has been removed.

74
00:02:39,527 --> 00:02:41,393
    Yeah.
                   Let's hit it.

75
00:02:41,395 --> 00:02:44,096
 Like I was getting ready to fly
      "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang."

76
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:46,832
I just want water to start
flowing through the stones.

77
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:48,300
                Look at that.

78
00:02:48,302 --> 00:02:49,902
               That's real deal.
   Yeah.

79
00:02:49,904 --> 00:02:51,036
                Now we gonna
               make tortillas?

80
00:02:51,038 --> 00:02:52,437
     Yep.
                     <i> Andale.</i>

81
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:54,306
              So, there we have
                  the masa.

82
00:02:54,308 --> 00:02:55,841
              This is the right
               moisture level?

83
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:57,009
   You just want,
  like, a Play-Doh.

84
00:02:57,011 --> 00:02:58,210
                    Okay.
                  Drop it.

85
00:02:58,212 --> 00:03:00,512
So, we do about 100 grams.

86
00:03:02,116 --> 00:03:04,116
With all this moisture,
   the fresh masa,

87
00:03:04,118 --> 00:03:05,951
 it's gonna puff up
 with all the steam,

88
00:03:05,953 --> 00:03:07,719
  so it's gonna get
a thin, crispy outside

89
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:10,772
and the inside is gonna be
fluffy, creamy, awesome texture.

90
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:13,041
                  Oh, we're
             ripping off chunks?

91
00:03:13,043 --> 00:03:17,246
             So, a lot heartier,
             a lot more magical

92
00:03:17,248 --> 00:03:19,982
than the regular chips and salsa
        that people are used to.

93
00:03:19,984 --> 00:03:22,434
  Yeah, these are,
like, really hearty.

94
00:03:22,436 --> 00:03:24,002
than the regular chips and salsa
        that you get in a 'male.

95
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:25,837
       Then you get a little bit
               of the crunch,

96
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:26,872
             little bit of salt.

97
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:28,440
               You definitely
             taste all the corn.

98
00:03:28,442 --> 00:03:30,609
                  You make
            the guacamole fresh.

99
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:33,111
            It's dynamite, dude.

100
00:03:33,113 --> 00:03:35,447
         I'm really telling you,
               it's dynamite.

101
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:37,049
                    Amen.

102
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:38,850
    Totopos, guac and salsa.

103
00:03:38,852 --> 00:03:41,753
 You could eat your body weight
   in those chips right there.

104
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:42,921
   They're hot, they're soft.

105
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:44,623
      It's full of flavor.

106
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,658
        For me, Taquiza's
      in the perfect spot.

107
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,160
  Seconds away from the beach.

108
00:03:48,162 --> 00:03:50,429
  So, you're kind of right here
  in the middle of everything.

109
00:03:50,431 --> 00:03:52,331
      People watching here
          is wonderful.

110
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:53,699
 MAN: You know, it's quick eats.

111
00:03:53,701 --> 00:03:55,334
       I wouldn't miss it
     if you're here in town.

112
00:03:55,336 --> 00:03:56,435
            So, here's the deal.

113
00:03:56,437 --> 00:03:58,036
                I want to try
          the grasshopper tacos.

114
00:03:58,038 --> 00:03:59,271
            I can't even believe
              I just said that.

115
00:03:59,273 --> 00:04:00,372
               But I got to go
               check on my car

116
00:04:00,374 --> 00:04:01,773
             'cause it's parked
        right next door to where

117
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:03,208
          they rent the Ferraris
            and the Lamborghinis

118
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:04,443
            here in South Beach.

119
00:04:04,445 --> 00:04:05,844
         So to make sure
  that they didn't rent my car,

120
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:07,112
               would you maybe
           get everything ready?

121
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:08,547
               We'll be back.
             Don't go anywhere,

122
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:10,382
       'cause of course you want
    to see me eat a grasshopper.

123
00:04:10,384 --> 00:04:12,284
          I'll see you a minute.
  I'll see you later.

            It's not that scary.

131
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:32,771
                And what else
             are we gonna make?

132
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:33,972
    Carne asada.

133
00:04:33,974 --> 00:04:36,475
          Oh, really? You had to
          drop the whole accent?

134
00:04:36,477 --> 00:04:38,443
   I'm from here.
  This is my home.

135
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,679
         The carne asada
       taco is fantastic.

136
00:04:40,681 --> 00:04:43,315
     It's spicy, it's rich.

137
00:04:43,317 --> 00:04:44,483
             All right, hit it.

138
00:04:44,485 --> 00:04:46,118
Chile de árbol.
            You hear the accent?

139
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,119
  Black peppercorn.

140
00:04:47,121 --> 00:04:48,620
Some Mexican oregano.

141
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:51,757
    Here is some
naked pasilla chiles.

142
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:52,958
Garlic cloves in there.

143
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,726
    White onion.

144
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:56,128
    Kosher salt.

145
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,797
Little oil just to kind of
get a nice texture going.

146
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,265
  Fresh lime juice.
     Fresh O.J.

147
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:01,466
       You just took this Cuban.

148
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:02,701
  This is my home.

149
00:05:02,703 --> 00:05:04,970
               No, I got you.
 I know exactly where you're at.

150
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:06,738
 And what are we gonna marinate?
             What kind of meat?

151
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:07,773
  Hanger steak.
                       Really?

152
00:05:07,775 --> 00:05:10,976
        Yeah.
Half an onion in the bag.

153
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:13,078
And now we just pour
the marinade right on top.

154
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,579
Vacuum it overnight.

155
00:05:14,581 --> 00:05:16,481
           It really pushes that
         marinade into the meat.

156
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:18,617
  Yeah. Everything
 gets vacuum sealed.

157
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:20,052
                You nerdified
                a taco stand.

158
00:05:20,054 --> 00:05:22,020
  Oh, if I have to.

159
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:24,489
      Oh, there goes your little
  chefy, geeky part right there,

160
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,091
          you and your tweezers.

161
00:05:26,093 --> 00:05:29,494
     Love them.
Marinated carne asada.

162
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,196
                I made a lot
         of tortillas in my day.

163
00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:32,964
         I have never seen this.

164
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:35,467
So, we just kind of get it,
    form in here,

165
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:36,768
and we just crank it off.

166
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:39,304
      So, see?

167
00:05:39,306 --> 00:05:41,506
                Look at that.
   This is not your first rodeo.

168
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:44,443
Here's our nice, little,
charred hanger steak.

169
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:48,080
Just a little greenery.

170
00:05:48,082 --> 00:05:51,183
All our tacos come with
just tortilla and the protein,

171
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:52,617
and then they can do
 whatever they want.

172
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:55,420
They add their onions,
cilantro, lime, radish.

173
00:05:55,422 --> 00:05:57,556
We have two hot sauces
   made in house.

174
00:05:57,558 --> 00:06:00,792
That's a charred cherry pepper,
and that's a charred jalapeño.

175
00:06:05,265 --> 00:06:08,500
          The first thing you're
       getting is that tortilla.

176
00:06:08,502 --> 00:06:12,604
              The hanger steak
               is ridiculous.

177
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:13,872
             Especially going on
               to blanch that,

178
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,073
                you're going
              on that flat-top,

179
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:16,408
             really gets a nice,
           little texture to it.

180
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:17,709
              You get a little
               caramelization.

181
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,544
  Yeah, yep.
                 The marinade --

182
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:20,846
       the sour orange in there.

183
00:06:20,848 --> 00:06:22,514
   Yeah.
               Salsa's dynamite.

184
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:27,085
             Mmm. Nice acidity,
                nice balance.

185
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:28,153
           This is spot on, man.

186
00:06:28,155 --> 00:06:30,956
              This is a really
               dynamite taco.

187
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,157
                    Mmm.

188
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:35,694
        They really nail
     the meat to masa ratio.

189
00:06:35,696 --> 00:06:38,163
    I've never had a tortilla
   like this ever in my life.

190
00:06:38,165 --> 00:06:41,533
Right now you're getting some
"Triple D" royalty, all right?

191
00:06:41,535 --> 00:06:43,902
The guy that takes all of
the blah, blah, blah

192
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:46,538
that I do on the show
and makes it turn into magic --

193
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,039
this is our editor, Jamie.

194
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:51,276
This is where you'll dub
in a bunch of clapping, okay?

195
00:06:51,278 --> 00:06:53,845
So, give me a breakdown.
Tell me about the carne asada.

196
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:56,982
 It's got some, like, brightness
     to it, tender, really good.

197
00:06:58,185 --> 00:07:00,485
            Let's finish this up
         with some grasshoppers.

198
00:07:00,487 --> 00:07:02,187
 They're nutty, they're crunchy.

199
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:04,423
        -Two chapulines.
         -It's amazing.

200
00:07:04,425 --> 00:07:05,357
              Well, hop to it.

201
00:07:05,359 --> 00:07:07,025
      SANTANA:
These are from Oaxaca.

202
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:09,194
Just kind of give them
a little extra toast.

203
00:07:09,196 --> 00:07:10,695
                Okay, so now
          we mix in the peppers.

204
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:12,230
Some oils from the chiles
 are gonna come out,

205
00:07:12,232 --> 00:07:13,865
so we just give them
a little more depth to it.

206
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:15,333
           How long are we gonna
             toast them up for?

207
00:07:15,335 --> 00:07:16,701
 Like 10 minutes.
                     10 minutes.

208
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:17,736
  250, real quick.

209
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:19,337
               And this is all
             it is in the taco?

210
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:20,572
        Yes.

211
00:07:20,574 --> 00:07:22,040
             So, basically we're
           putting the guac down

212
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:23,508
       just so we have something
          for the little hoppers

213
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,810
                to stick to.
    Yeah.

214
00:07:24,812 --> 00:07:26,611
Every time we make an order,
we just kind of toast them

215
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,180
a little bit more, just
warm a little through.

216
00:07:28,182 --> 00:07:29,848
                 Wake them up?
    Yeah.

217
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:32,617
And then there's one of my
favorite misused ingredients --

218
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:35,687
Tajín -- so it's like
a chile lime seasoning.

219
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:37,355
It's made for fruit.

220
00:07:37,357 --> 00:07:40,158
        So, I can feel that I'll
      run faster, jump higher...

221
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,293
     Of course.

222
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:44,463
           ...and live healthier
            eating grasshoppers.

223
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,067
             There's like a ton
        of chicharróns in there.

224
00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:54,739
       What? Am I Andrew Zimmern
                 right now?

225

                   Andrew.

226
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:59,077
              This is the bomb.
                Nicely done.

227
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:00,812
        MAN: A little bit
  intimidating at first glance,

228
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:04,149
    but you got to go for it
 'cause the flavors are amazing.

229
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:06,751

      when you get into it.

230
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:08,119
         There's nothing
         more depressing

231
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:09,855
 than looking down at your tray
       and nothing's left,

232
00:08:09,857 --> 00:08:12,757
but you can just walk a few feet
       and get some more.

233
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:16,761
    This is probably the closest
   to a legit Mexican taco stand

234
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:18,363

262
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:21,493
 And this is Hofbrau
like you'd find in Munich?

263
00:09:21,495 --> 00:09:22,694
                  Exactly.
            It's the same thing.

264
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:24,563
Will you be dressing
in any type of lederhosen?

265
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:27,098
               Uh...sometimes.
                [ Chuckles ]

266
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,967
      And Chef Mike Smerda
         is making sure

267
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:30,502
       that what's coming
       out of the kitchen

268
00:09:30,504 --> 00:09:32,704
      is also straight out
        of the homeland.

269
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:35,240
                 Sauerbraten
           with napkin dumpling.

270
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:36,641
  The sauerbraten is wonderful.

271
00:09:36,643 --> 00:09:40,111
        My mother's isn't
        as good as this.

272
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:41,546
          I'm making sauerbraten
               for you today.

273
00:09:41,548 --> 00:09:44,416
     It's a very classic recipe,
   but I give it a modern twist.

274
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:45,984
             I use beef knuckle.

275
00:09:45,986 --> 00:09:47,886
                   We use
           the wine and vinegar.

276
00:09:47,888 --> 00:09:49,321
 The "winegar"?
                      Yes.

277
00:09:49,323 --> 00:09:51,556
        Now we have a little bit
            of balsamic vinegar.

278
00:09:51,558 --> 00:09:53,625
                     Soy sauce.
 Worcestershire.

279
00:09:53,627 --> 00:09:54,726
                   Honey.

280
00:09:54,728 --> 00:09:56,061
  Cinnamon sticks.
                Cinnamon sticks.

281
00:09:56,063 --> 00:09:58,163
               Some bay leafs.
                Fresh garlic.

282
00:09:58,165 --> 00:10:00,198
               Sliced ginger.
                   Cloves.

283
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,300
        Crushed juniper berries.
                  Allspice.

284
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:04,035
                 Some thyme.
                  Rosemary.

285
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:05,136
    Okay.
                 We have onions.

286
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:06,838
     Very nice.
                      Carrots.

287
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,307
            Chopped celery roots
              and sliced leek.

288
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:11,242
We'll let it marinate
like this for how long?

289
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:13,278
               For seven days.

290
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,647
             And now I show you
     how I make my meat dry rub.

291
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:18,516
             We start with salt,
           brown onions, garlic,

292
00:10:18,518 --> 00:10:20,952
                black pepper,
              ground coriander,

293
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:23,388
           paprika, a little bit
              of sugar, nutmeg.

294
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,656
    Mix that up.

295
00:10:24,658 --> 00:10:26,157
    Rub that on.

296
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:28,426
     I will sear it on the grill
              on the flat-top.

297
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:30,362
               And also I sear
               the vegetables.

298
00:10:30,364 --> 00:10:32,564
So, once it's seared,
it'll go back in the pan

299
00:10:32,566 --> 00:10:34,332
with the braising liquid?

300
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:35,500
Braise the whole thing off.

301
00:10:35,502 --> 00:10:37,002
     For three-and-a-half hours.
 At what temp?

302
00:10:37,004 --> 00:10:38,436
                    350.

303
00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:39,704
             Now we start making
             a pretzel dumpling.

304
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:41,106
 Bavarian pretzels.
                        Yes.

305
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:42,140
How big do we cut them?

306
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:44,576
         Very small, very small.

307
00:10:44,578 --> 00:10:45,944
         I already prepare some.
  All right.

308
00:10:45,946 --> 00:10:47,946
       Then I have melted butter
                and hot milk.

309
00:10:47,948 --> 00:10:50,215
       This is
pretzel bread pudding.

310
00:10:50,217 --> 00:10:52,851
             I sauté with bacon
          and onions to the mix.

311
00:10:52,853 --> 00:10:54,586
Lots of deliciousness
    right there.

312
00:10:54,588 --> 00:10:57,922
                Black pepper,
        the salt, ground nutmeg.

313
00:10:57,924 --> 00:10:59,224
               Then toss them.

314
00:10:59,226 --> 00:11:01,459
             This has to set for
   10, 15 minutes in the fridge.

315
00:11:01,461 --> 00:11:03,128
     All right,
so this is cooled down.

316
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,562
Now we add the eggs.

317
00:11:04,564 --> 00:11:05,730
                Chopped parsley.
    Okay.

318
00:11:05,732 --> 00:11:07,065
                     Marjoram.
     Okay.

319
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:09,134
                Combine them.

320
00:11:09,136 --> 00:11:10,602
             I need some panko.

321
00:11:10,604 --> 00:11:13,004
Japanese breadcrumbs
   in German food.

322
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,006
                  That set
           15, 20 minutes again.

323
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,708
Okay. And it's called
 a napkin dumpling?

324
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,610
               Napkin dumpling
        because back in the day,

325
00:11:18,612 --> 00:11:22,881
        we used regular napkins,
         but I use plastic wrap.

326
00:11:22,883 --> 00:11:25,583
Seen this every day --
    not so much.

327
00:11:25,585 --> 00:11:26,851
  Okay, so you poke
  some holes in it.

328
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:27,919
                It has to get
               some water in.

329
00:11:27,921 --> 00:11:28,920
How long does that boil?

330
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:30,588
                 25 minutes.
             Just let it simmer.

331
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:33,091
Then we bring it out,
unwrap it, and then slice it.

332
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:34,693
               Then I sear it.
 You sear it in butter.

333
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:35,960
           In butter, of course.

334
00:11:35,962 --> 00:11:36,961
     Fantastic.

335
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:38,697
                    Okay.
         Here's the sauerbraten.

336
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:39,998
              Nice color, huh?

337
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,033
 Look at that, huh?

338
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,702
                  Let's see
              how tender it is.

339
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:46,604
              Some red cabbage
               and then meat.

340
00:11:46,606 --> 00:11:47,706
          And a little of gravy.

341
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,541
And this is the drippings
   out of the pan?

342
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:52,711
      Absolutely. And then I add
             a pretzel dumpling.

343
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:55,180
                 Good to go.

344
00:11:55,182 --> 00:11:56,281
        Mmm.

345
00:11:56,283 --> 00:12:00,051
I pick up the allspice
and the crushed juniper.

346
00:12:01,188 --> 00:12:02,954
The gravy comes through
 right off the bat.

347
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:05,023
  You want to drink
  a bucket of that.

348
00:12:05,025 --> 00:12:07,692
The pretzel dumpling
 is just ridiculous.

349
00:12:07,694 --> 00:12:08,760
  I love pretzels.

350
00:12:08,762 --> 00:12:10,061
 You get that nice,
    little flavor

351
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,030
of that coming through.

352
00:12:12,032 --> 00:12:13,665
And then you get a little bit
   of the cabbage.

353
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:15,166
Refreshes the palate.

354
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:16,101
        Mmm.

355
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:17,435
 Nicely done, buddy.
    Nicely done.

356
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:18,770
                      Thank you.
It's really good.

357
00:12:18,772 --> 00:12:20,321
    Really g hf or

358
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:22,457
They're a little crispy,
                      Thank you.
Itbut yet they're soft inside.

359
00:12:22,459 --> 00:12:23,558
    MAN: You don't really get

360
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,527
         to enjoy these
     kind of flavors often.

361
00:12:25,529 --> 00:12:27,662
    MAN #2: Curry sausage in
 the window, please! Pick it up!

362
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:28,963
    Currywurst is very good.

363
00:12:28,965 --> 00:12:31,966
       Little more lively
     than regular bratwurst.

364
00:12:31,968 --> 00:12:33,301
        So, for our curry sauce,

365
00:12:33,303 --> 00:12:36,304
              I need oil, a lot
      of onions, garlic, ginger.

366
00:12:36,306 --> 00:12:37,439
             Our curry blend in.

367
00:12:37,441 --> 00:12:38,740
                       Ketchup.
   Ketchup.

368
00:12:38,742 --> 00:12:39,908
     That's what
   I was thinking.

369
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,142
               Diced tomatoes.

370
00:12:41,144 --> 00:12:42,410
         A good amount of honey.

371
00:12:42,412 --> 00:12:43,578
           And now we fill it up
                 with water.

372
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,979
How long is this gonna
  cook down, Chef?

373
00:12:44,981 --> 00:12:46,181
                 25 minutes.

374
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:48,149
All right, so you hit
the immersion blender in here

375
00:12:48,151 --> 00:12:49,150
to break it all down.

376
00:12:49,152 --> 00:12:52,921
            Score the bratwurst,
                curry sauce.

377
00:12:52,923 --> 00:12:54,556
       More of
the currywurst powder.

378
00:12:54,558 --> 00:12:55,924
                    Yes.

379
00:12:57,861 --> 00:12:59,928
Mmm. That's a really
    good sausage.

380
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:02,564
 The gravy's great.

381
00:13:02,566 --> 00:13:04,299
It's deep, a unique flavor.

382
00:13:04,301 --> 00:13:06,501
There's nothing you're
not gonna like about that.

383
00:13:06,503 --> 00:13:07,669
            WAITRESS:
       This is currywurst.

384
00:13:07,671 --> 00:13:09,003
        It is excellent.

385
00:13:09,005 --> 00:13:10,972
WOMAN: I am halfway through one,
     and I plan to eat both.

386
00:13:10,974 --> 00:13:12,240
         It's delicious.

387
00:13:12,242 --> 00:13:14,142
    It's a great experience.

388
00:13:14,144 --> 00:13:15,543
    When you walk
through these doors,

389
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:17,712
you come to a funky,
old German bar, real beer,

390
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:20,114
     big steins,
and great German food

391
00:13:20,116 --> 00:13:21,349

461
00:15:35,318 --> 00:15:36,517
              So it doesn't get

464
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:41,322
      And then?

465
00:15:41,324 --> 00:15:42,890
    A little bit of lemon juice.
                 That's it.

466
00:15:42,892 --> 00:15:44,192
                   Plate it up.
  Here we go.

467
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:46,361
    We're gonna build a fortress
       of mussels all around it.

468
00:15:46,363 --> 00:15:47,462
 A mussel fortress.

469
00:15:47,464 --> 00:15:50,064
               Finish spooning
                it up on top.

470
00:15:50,066 --> 00:15:53,668
               Celery micros,

I'll tell you what, buddy.

473

 Your seafood depth,
all that shell stock

479

   from the clams
and from the mussels

480
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,021
really, really opens up

Of course I've got to have
Carl the Cuban down here.

     Real deal?

492

            Scallops.

496
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,053
   But once you come in here,

497
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,788
  you feel like you're actually
      in a different world.

   You don't have
a dining room, okay?

505
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:02,170
 People sit outside
     by a pool,

in this tiny, little kitchen.

00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:05,473
              Yeah, every day.

508
00:17:05,475 --> 00:17:06,641
  So, Caputo flour.

509
00:17:06,643 --> 00:17:07,942
                      Semolina.
      Okay.

510
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:10,044
                Hook this up
               to the blender.

511
00:17:10,046 --> 00:17:12,346
             And we're gonna add
            our eggs one by one.

512
00:17:12,348 --> 00:17:13,481
        Okay.

513
00:17:13,483 --> 00:17:16,184
            Then dust the table,
         and we're gonna roll it

514
00:17:16,186 --> 00:17:18,453
                until you get
           a doughy consistency.

515
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:19,320
                There you go.

516
00:17:19,322 --> 00:17:21,522
    Let it rest,
   portion it off.

517
00:17:21,524 --> 00:17:22,890
      We're gonna hand-crank it,

518
00:17:22,892 --> 00:17:24,258
            and then we're gonna
               cut it by hand.

519
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,627
 Beautiful linguine
      in house.

520
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:28,196
The fact you made it yourself --
      I mean...

521
00:17:28,198 --> 00:17:29,564
                There you go.

522
00:17:29,566 --> 00:17:31,466
     We're gonna start by adding
           olive oil to our pot.

523
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:32,600
                  Shallots.

524
00:17:32,602 --> 00:17:33,935
                Fresh garlic.

525
00:17:33,937 --> 00:17:35,636
                  Bay leaf.

526
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:37,071
        Add a little pinch of...

527
00:17:37,073 --> 00:17:38,206
    Chile flake.

528
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:42,276
              We glaze the pan
           with oil, white wine.

529
00:17:42,278 --> 00:17:44,645
               Add our clams.

530
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:45,980
        Okay.
Little chicken stock.

531
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:47,949
                   Mm-hmm.
                Pasta's down.

532
00:17:47,951 --> 00:17:49,650
           Clams are opening up.

533
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:52,220
        And then we're gonna add
     more pasta to our stockpot.

534
00:17:52,222 --> 00:17:55,289
So that pasta will absorb
all of that great flavor.

535
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:56,357
It'll finish cooking
   in that broth.

536
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:57,625
   Got it.
                That is correct.

537
00:17:57,627 --> 00:18:00,094
           Add some heavy cream,
       butter to finish cooking.

538
00:18:00,096 --> 00:18:02,029
    Okay.
         A little bit of pepper.

539
00:18:02,031 --> 00:18:04,699
             All right. Little,
    tiny squeeze of lemon juice.

540
00:18:04,701 --> 00:18:07,635
     Beautiful clams, little bit
              of sauce, micros.

541
00:18:07,637 --> 00:18:09,370
                   Voilà.

542
00:18:11,608 --> 00:18:14,408
The pasta's al dente,
 really nicely done.

543
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:15,710
Finishing it in the sauce

544
00:18:15,712 --> 00:18:17,645
  to let it absorb
those great flavors.

545
00:18:17,647 --> 00:18:19,380
  It's outstanding.

546
00:18:19,382 --> 00:18:21,616
 Everything you do,
    you do right.

547
00:18:21,618 --> 00:18:23,284
I mean, I'm -- I'm --

548
00:18:23,286 --> 00:18:25,586
And I don't want to hear it,
but I'm almost speechless.

549
00:18:25,588 --> 00:18:27,555
                [ Chuckles ]

550
00:18:27,557 --> 00:18:29,023
   I said I don't
  want to hear it.

551
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:32,727
         Spicy linguine.
      It's just incredible.

552
00:18:32,729 --> 00:18:33,628
Break it down for me.

553
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:34,829
              It's just simple.

554
00:18:34,831 --> 00:18:36,264
             Everyone overthinks
                 this dish.

555
00:18:36,266 --> 00:18:37,598
         They do too much to it.

556
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,033
               The best thing
                about this is

557
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:41,269
            he had the restraint
               of a real chef.

558
00:18:41,271 --> 00:18:43,070
       Strong Bow Chicken.

559
00:18:43,072 --> 00:18:45,273
  It's a wonderful oasis here.
          It really is.

560
00:18:45,275 --> 00:18:46,440
   You're a funky,
    little joint

561
00:18:46,442 --> 00:18:48,976
     tucked away
under an unassuming name,

562
00:18:48,978 --> 00:18:50,378
  and you're doing
   rockstar food.

563
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,979
               Thank you, sir.

564
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:55,650
     FIERI: Think that's all
     the South Beach we got?

565
00:18:55,652 --> 00:18:58,119
            Not yet.
   There's just one more spot.

566
00:18:58,121 --> 00:18:59,554
  How are you, brother?
                 I'm doing good.

567
00:18:59,556 --> 00:19:02,323
  This is kind of an official,
   unofficial "Triple D" spot

568
00:19:02,325 --> 00:19:04,025
    because I've been coming
     to this place forever.

569
00:19:04,027 --> 00:19:06,527
        This is a walk-up
       cool place to hang,

570
00:19:06,529 --> 00:19:08,029
  and the sandwiches are legit.

571
00:19:08,031 --> 00:19:09,430
  I'm talking real deal legit.

572
00:19:09,432 --> 00:19:11,098
  Let's do a Napoli.
                        Yeah.

573
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:15,570
 Let's do a Frenchie
  and a SOBE Club.

574
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:17,438
             Okay. And you want
             everything, right?

575
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,373
 Do it up.
          With the magic sauce?

576
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:20,975
With the magic sauce.
                   You got it.

577
00:19:20,977 --> 00:19:22,844
So, tell me how this opened.
Give me the rundown.

578
00:19:22,846 --> 00:19:24,645
                Before we was
       living in Thailand and...

579
00:19:24,647 --> 00:19:26,747
So you came to Miami
 to go scuba diving,

580
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:28,149
 but you were living
    in Thailand.

581
00:19:28,151 --> 00:19:29,584
And you're from France.
                       Yeah.

582
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:31,219
 Oh, yeah. You hear
that story every day.

583
00:19:31,221 --> 00:19:33,321
  And South Beach, at that time,
          it was really nothing.

584
00:19:33,323 --> 00:19:34,689
    You were here
 before it was cool.

585
00:19:34,691 --> 00:19:36,290
                    Yeah.
                 Since 1988.

586
00:19:36,292 --> 00:19:38,860
So I mean, you're kind of like
one of the anchors down here.

587
00:19:38,862 --> 00:19:40,962
How many sandwiches do you guys
serve in, let's say,

588
00:19:40,964 --> 00:19:42,029
  a busy Saturday?

589
00:19:42,031 --> 00:19:44,465
               Sometimes 500,
           sometimes like 1,000.

590
00:19:44,467 --> 00:19:45,800
So, when you come here,

591
00:19:45,802 --> 00:19:47,969
you can stand in line,
you can maybe get a stool.

592
00:19:47,971 --> 00:19:50,071
   You're probably
 gonna get it to go.

593
00:19:50,073 --> 00:19:52,106
    Nice people,
  great sandwiches.

594
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:53,641
  I mean, you won't
  be disappointed.

595
00:19:53,643 --> 00:19:55,576
  Right? Told you I'd bring you
         a funky joint.

596
00:19:55,578 --> 00:19:56,510
          Here you go.

597
00:19:56,512 --> 00:19:57,511
              Here you go, Guy.

598
00:19:57,513 --> 00:19:59,247
                The Frenchie,
           the SOBE, the Napoli,

599
00:19:59,249 --> 00:20:00,848
            and the magic sauce,
                 my friend.

600
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:02,450
   Oh, I get a jar
 of the magic sauce?

601
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:03,618
                    Magic sauce.
   You're the best.

602
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,186
             You take care, man.
 I'll see you, brother.

603
00:20:05,188 --> 00:20:06,888
 Be good.
             I'll see you later.

604
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:11,058
  So, that's it for this trip,
        but don't worry!

605
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,727
       There's plenty more
        "Triple D" joints

606
00:20:12,729 --> 00:20:14,161
      all over the country!

607
00:20:14,163 --> 00:20:15,863
         I'll be looking
      for you next week on

608
00:20:15,865 --> 00:20:18,699
 "Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives."

609
00:20:18,701 --> 00:20:20,701
 I want you to say,
"It's all right here,

610
00:20:20,703 --> 00:20:23,404
    right now on
'Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives.'"

611
00:20:23,406 --> 00:20:26,474
                   Here on
  "Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives."

612
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:28,676
 I like that. I got
to start speaking more German.

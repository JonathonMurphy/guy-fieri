1
00:00:01,002 --> 00:00:02,067
Hey, everybody.

2
00:00:02,069 --> 00:00:03,535
I'm Guy Fieri,
  and we're rolling out

3
00:00:03,537 --> 00:00:06,905
looking for America's greatest
 diners, drive-ins, and dives.

4
00:00:06,907 --> 00:00:08,374
This trip...

5
00:00:08,376 --> 00:00:09,241
Ho!

6
00:00:09,243 --> 00:00:10,376
...we're heating up the meat...

7
00:00:10,378 --> 00:00:11,810
This should seriously
  be illegal.

8
00:00:11,812 --> 00:00:14,013
...alongside cool
  veggie creations.

9
00:00:14,015 --> 00:00:15,481
That's lights out.

10
00:00:15,483 --> 00:00:16,749
In Modesto, California...

11
00:00:16,751 --> 00:00:18,717
Ding, ding, ding, ding!

12
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:20,219
...a strip-mall standout...

13
00:00:20,221 --> 00:00:21,120
Spot-on.

14
00:00:21,122 --> 00:00:22,621
...laying it on thick.

15
00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:24,456
Boy,
that's a big sandwich, man.

16
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:25,791
In Oakland, California...

17
00:00:25,793 --> 00:00:26,592
That's how I roll.

18
00:00:26,594 --> 00:00:28,127
...a legit vegan joint...

19
00:00:28,129 --> 00:00:29,328
You had me at hello.

20
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:31,663
...where soul is served
 straight from the heart.

21
00:00:31,665 --> 00:00:33,232
All day long, girl.

22
00:00:33,234 --> 00:00:34,466
In Islamorada, Florida...

23
00:00:34,468 --> 00:00:37,169
So this is a little
 pigskin candy.

24
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:39,104
...a rare non-seafood spot...

25
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:40,139
That is weird.

26
00:00:40,141 --> 00:00:42,508
...puts some zing in the wing.

27
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:44,543
I might have
to borrow this recipe.

28
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:46,545
That's all right here,
   right now,

29
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:48,614
on "Diners, Drive-ins,
   and Dives."

30
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:05,664
So,
 when you're traveling south

31
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:07,599
from Miami, Florida,
  through the Keys,

32
00:01:07,601 --> 00:01:09,668
you'll come through a chain
 of islands known as Islamorada.

33
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:10,836
And you'll see a bunch
   of restaurants.

34
00:01:10,838 --> 00:01:12,571
Let's see,
 you got seafood restaurant,

35
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:14,239
seafood restaurant,
  seafood restaurant,

36
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:16,108
and then finally M.E.A.T.

37
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,746
Juicy Lucy in the window.

38
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:22,481
I love what they do here.

39
00:01:22,483 --> 00:01:23,882
Homemade pastrami Reuben.

40
00:01:23,884 --> 00:01:26,618
It's very different and unique.

41
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,887
These guys are just amazing.

42
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:31,790
That'd be restaurant lifers
 George Patti and Thomas Smith

43
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:36,495
who partnered up on this rogue
 Florida Keys joint in 2012.

44
00:01:36,497 --> 00:01:39,031
People told us we were insane
for doing this concept.

45
00:01:39,033 --> 00:01:40,866
They did.
You can't eat seafood every day.

46
00:01:40,868 --> 00:01:42,634
So, George puts his chef cred

47
00:01:42,636 --> 00:01:45,170
on display with food
  that doesn't swim.

48
00:01:45,172 --> 00:01:46,939
He is a burger champ.

49
00:01:46,941 --> 00:01:50,542
He does great things
 with smoking meats and wings.

50
00:01:50,544 --> 00:01:51,643
Chicken wings in the window.

51
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:53,545
The chicken wings
   just rock here.

52
00:01:53,547 --> 00:01:54,580
They're smoked.

53
00:01:54,582 --> 00:01:55,814
They have a dry rub on them.

54
00:01:55,816 --> 00:01:58,250
You can taste all
  of that in the wing.

55
00:01:58,252 --> 00:01:59,618
Into making wings.
Give me the rundown.

56
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:03,922
Okay, we got our water,
 bay leaf, salt, sugar, garlic.

57
00:02:03,924 --> 00:02:06,825
Boil it, add the wings
  to a big plastic container,

58
00:02:06,827 --> 00:02:07,993
dump it over hot,

59
00:02:07,995 --> 00:02:09,895
let it sit on it
   for about a half-hour,

60
00:02:09,897 --> 00:02:11,263
and then hit ice on top.

61
00:02:11,265 --> 00:02:13,732
Cover it, in the cooler
 overnight for about 12 hours.

62
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:17,469
So you mildly poach
  your wings

63
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,538
to brine them
and partially cook them.

64
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:20,672
- Correct.
   -That is weird.

65
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:22,374
- This is M.E.A.T.
    -Okay.

66
00:02:22,376 --> 00:02:24,443
Okay, now
  we're gonna make the rub.

67
00:02:24,445 --> 00:02:26,778
Kosher salt,
    sugar, brown sugar.

68
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:27,880
Okay.

69
00:02:27,882 --> 00:02:32,151
Cumin, chili powder,
   black pepper, paprika,

70
00:02:32,153 --> 00:02:33,452
and Cayenne.

71
00:02:33,454 --> 00:02:35,287
The dry rub onto the wings.

72
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:39,691
Go into the smoker
  for 4 hours at 200 degrees.

73
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:40,759
And now what are we into?

74
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:42,161
Our house-made
   Worcestershire sauce.

75
00:02:42,163 --> 00:02:44,263
And you make the Worcestershire
to go in the barbecue sauce?

76
00:02:44,265 --> 00:02:46,298
- Correct.
  -Of course you do.

77
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,834
Oil, onions, jalapeños,

78
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:50,502
garlic, black pepper,

79
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:51,870
anchovies.
    -Ho!

80
00:02:51,872 --> 00:02:53,438
They look like snails,
  but that's just anchovies.

81
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,473
Cloves.

82
00:02:54,475 --> 00:02:56,742
Salt, lemons, corn syrup.

83
00:02:56,744 --> 00:02:57,876
- Really?
   -Mm-hmm.

84
00:02:57,878 --> 00:03:00,913
Rice wine vinegar,
   ginger, horseradish.

85
00:03:00,915 --> 00:03:02,814
- Wow.
    -Cumin.

86
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:04,216
I might have to
 borrow this recipe.

87
00:03:04,218 --> 00:03:07,719
A little bit of water,
     molasses.

88
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:09,188
We're gonna let
   that come up to a boil

89
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,789
and then let it go
    about 4 hours.

90
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:12,057
That's crazy.

91
00:03:12,059 --> 00:03:14,059
Then we puree it,
     strain it.

92
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:16,295
It keeps in the cooler
    for up to a year.

93
00:03:16,297 --> 00:03:19,364
This is the honey-chipotle
    barbecue sauce.

94
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:20,532
The molasses-beer barbecue.

95
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,100
And that has
the Worcestershire in it.

96
00:03:22,102 --> 00:03:25,704
Correct.
 Chipotle peppers, lime juice.

97
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:28,240
Sweet chili sauce.

98
00:03:28,242 --> 00:03:29,841
Honey, and then a little bit
     of salt.

99
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:32,945
Okay.

100
00:03:32,947 --> 00:03:34,012
This should be good.

101
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:36,782
Mmm.

102
00:03:36,784 --> 00:03:37,983
That'd be great
 on anything.

103
00:03:37,985 --> 00:03:39,651
You can put it on a shoe.
    You know the deal.

104
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:41,019
- A flip-flop.
 -I heard that somewhere.

105
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:42,221
Yeah.

106
00:03:42,223 --> 00:03:43,322
Wings are out of the smoker.

107
00:03:43,324 --> 00:03:44,656
A little bit of water.

108
00:03:44,658 --> 00:03:45,991
Not gonna fry them.

109
00:03:45,993 --> 00:03:48,260
Nope, and then we'll glaze them
  with the barbecue sauce,

110
00:03:48,262 --> 00:03:49,928
and we'll cook them
 until they're basically soft.

111
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,531
The idea is to have them,
 like, fall apart like a rib.

112
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:53,732
These better be good,
  George.

113
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:54,900
I'm trusting you.

114
00:03:57,171 --> 00:04:00,973
Blue cheese crumbles,
    and that's it.

115
00:04:03,344 --> 00:04:04,509
That's a good wing, man.

116
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:06,011
- Thank you.
 -That's a really good wing.

117
00:04:06,013 --> 00:04:07,879
So soft and so tender.

118
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:09,481
The seasoning is great.

119
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:10,949
The smoke is in balance.

120
00:04:10,951 --> 00:04:12,317
A little bit
 of the blue cheese

121
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,685
gives a nice little tang
  to it.

122
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:17,089
The key, though,
without question, the sauce.

123
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:18,357
- Cool.
 -The sauce should be bottled,

124
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:20,559
and serve it
with a complimentary flip-flop.

125
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:22,194
--Spot-on. Well done.

126
00:04:22,196 --> 00:04:23,195
Thank you.

127
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:25,897
Chicken wings.

128
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:28,533
They taste phenomenal.

129
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:32,104
They got that sweet spicy
  little heat to them.

130
00:04:32,106 --> 00:04:33,372
Wings in a pan.

131
00:04:33,374 --> 00:04:35,807
George is a very creative chef.

132
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:37,476
It turns out,
 we have a "Triple D" vet

133
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:38,844
who feels the same way.

134
00:04:38,846 --> 00:04:41,380
So, you guys
know who this guy is, right?

135
00:04:41,382 --> 00:04:43,115
This is our buddy
Stretch from Grinders.

136
00:04:43,117 --> 00:04:45,384
So, Stretch,
you could certify this guy?

137
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:48,754
Dynamite. All right.

138
00:04:48,756 --> 00:04:50,355
I just wanted to make sure.

139
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:53,692
You got this kind
 of gourmet meats every day.

140
00:04:53,694 --> 00:04:56,361
Homemade pork rinds
 with a chimichurri aioli.

141
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:58,964
The pork rinds are the freshest
   I've ever had.

142
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:00,999
They come out cracking.

143
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:02,034
- We're making chicharrones.
    -Yes.

144
00:05:02,036 --> 00:05:03,602
So, we're talking pork skin

145
00:05:03,604 --> 00:05:05,203
that's had the hair
 taken off of it.

146
00:05:05,205 --> 00:05:06,271
The fat's been trimmed off.

147
00:05:06,273 --> 00:05:08,573
b leaf,
 that's had the hair
 taken off of it.

148
00:05:08,575 --> 00:05:10,208
and then
   we just add the skin.

149
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,543
And how long are we gonna
 let this go?

150
00:05:11,545 --> 00:05:13,111
About three hours
     at a simmer

151
00:05:13,113 --> 00:05:15,747
until it just about
  falls apart, translucent.

152
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:17,382
- Got it.
 -We lay it on a sheet pan,

153
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:19,017
let it go
  in the walk-in overnight,

154
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:20,619
then we get a kitchen spoon
    and scrape it.

155
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:21,853
The little bit
of fat that was left.

156
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:23,388
- Correct.
    -Then?

157
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:28,060
We cut them into small cubes,
 put them into the dehydrator.

158
00:05:28,062 --> 00:05:30,462
So, this is the little
 pigskin candy.

159
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:33,832
Man, that's a lot
 of work, dude.

160
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:35,701
Let's go,
get some chicharrones frying.

161
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:41,673
Once you have chicharrones
  like this,

162
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:44,276
you will never want to have them
out of the bag again.

163
00:05:44,278 --> 00:05:46,378
And then this is
   the barbecue seasoning.

164
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,579
You can hear them
crackling right now,

165
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:48,880
that season starts to hit it.

166
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:50,482
Yeah, people love it
 when they come out like that.

167
00:05:50,484 --> 00:05:51,516
And what's gonna
 go with this?

168
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,085
The chimichurri aioli.

169
00:05:55,356 --> 00:05:56,521
Can you hear that?

170
00:06:00,094 --> 00:06:02,027
I've had a lot
of chicharrones, man.

171
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:04,863
This right here,
this is the benchmark.

172
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:05,864
- Cool.
  -I mean, really, dude.

173
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:06,898
Thank you.

174
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,567
This should seriously
  be illegal.

175
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:12,771
The little chimichurri aioli
  is perfect.

176
00:06:12,773 --> 00:06:14,539
Look it up
 in the dictionary,

177
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,308
and this is what
you'll see coming together.

178
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,776
When they made
that peanut butter cup

179
00:06:17,778 --> 00:06:20,612
and chocolate thing,
they were trying to create this.

180
00:06:20,614 --> 00:06:23,048
I like that.

181
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,350
That's good.

182
00:06:25,352 --> 00:06:29,254
Crunchy, airy, spicy,
  flavorful all at once.

183
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:31,123
Dr. Jelly Finger
   in the window.

184
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:32,290
It's phenomenal.

185
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:34,126
Our favorite place to go.

186
00:06:34,128 --> 00:06:35,260
- Real deal.
    -Yep.

187
00:06:35,262 --> 00:06:36,661
- Nicely done.
   -Thanks, Guy.

188
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:38,930
- Now make me some more.

189
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,166
Coming up in Oakland...

190
00:06:41,168 --> 00:06:42,801
Good look right there.

191
00:06:42,803 --> 00:06:44,136
...serious soul food...

192
00:06:44,138 --> 00:06:45,904
Take me to po' boy town.
  ...minus the meat.

193
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:47,239
I'm not missing the chicken
    in that at all.

194
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:56,715
So, I think on "Triple D,"

195
00:06:56,717 --> 00:06:59,851
by now, you've come
 to expect the unexpected.

196
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:01,953
So, I'm here in Oakland,
   California,

197
00:07:01,955 --> 00:07:04,222
in an area known
  as Jack London Square.

198
00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:05,590
All kinds of restaurants.

199
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:07,993
Indian, pizza, steakhouse.

200
00:07:07,995 --> 00:07:09,561
So, what am I here to check out?

201
00:07:09,563 --> 00:07:11,229
Wait for it, wait for it.

202
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:13,231
Exactly
 what you're not expecting --

203
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:14,399
a vegan joint.

204
00:07:14,401 --> 00:07:16,535
Actually, Souley Vegan.

205
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:20,572
Steak burger with fries.

206
00:07:20,574 --> 00:07:23,141
When I stumbled upon this
gold mine, I was, like, "Wow."

207
00:07:23,143 --> 00:07:25,477
We have the platter
   here for you.

208
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:26,611
It's amazing.

209
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,480
Full of all kinds
  of different flavors.

210
00:07:28,482 --> 00:07:29,748
Black-eyed pea fritters up.

211
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,317
It's not just for
  vegetarians and vegans,

212
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,352
but soul-food enthusiasts.

213
00:07:34,354 --> 00:07:37,656
And it comes from a Bay Area
 native with Louisiana roots,

214
00:07:37,658 --> 00:07:40,659
Tamearra Dyson,
 whose passion started young.

215
00:07:40,661 --> 00:07:42,194
I turned vegan at 17

216
00:07:42,196 --> 00:07:45,096
and started cooking
at about 18 years old.

217
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:46,932
Which is a skill
  she kept developing

218
00:07:46,934 --> 00:07:48,567
while working to become a nurse

219
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:51,703
until finally, well,
 she went with her true passion

220
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:54,105
and opened this joint
   in 2009.

221
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:57,943
I just want to introduce
vegan food to people in a way

222
00:07:57,945 --> 00:07:59,478
that they can just
 understand it.

223
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,712
Okra gumbo up.

224
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:02,147
The okra gumbo,
 it's a great, hearty meal.

225
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:04,850
It's very flavorful,
 just bursts in your mouth.

226
00:08:04,852 --> 00:08:05,884
How we starting this?

227
00:08:05,886 --> 00:08:09,020
I am going
to make my love spice.

228
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:13,692
So, we have
granulated garlic, sea salt,

229
00:08:13,694 --> 00:08:15,794
black pepper,
 and paprika.

230
00:08:15,796 --> 00:08:17,095
Give it a little mix.

231
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:19,431
So we're using this as the base
 for my okra gumbo.

232
00:08:19,433 --> 00:08:21,333
- Got it.
  -All right, olive oil.

233
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:22,701
Onions first. All right.

234
00:08:22,703 --> 00:08:24,636
Now we have our red
and green bell pepper.

235
00:08:24,638 --> 00:08:26,605
When you put that many peppers
   and onions in a dish,

236
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:28,139
you had me at hello.

237
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:30,275
Sea salt,
coarse black pepper.

238
00:08:30,277 --> 00:08:33,378
- Of course you do.
   -Cayenne, okra.

239
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,746
- Okay.
    -Corn.

240
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:36,982
- Okay.
  -Seaweed, love spice.

241
00:08:36,984 --> 00:08:38,149
Love spice.

242
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:41,686
Stewed tomatoes.

243
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,722
Oh, so now
  we're putting in the pork.

244
00:08:43,724 --> 00:08:46,391
No, this is marinated,
 seasoned tofu.

245
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:49,261
Now, how long is this gonna
     cook down?

246
00:08:49,263 --> 00:08:50,896
30 to 45 minutes.

247
00:08:50,898 --> 00:08:52,898
- We serve that with...
   -Basmati rice.

248
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,066
And a big sheet of nori.

249
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:56,701
That's how I roll.

250
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:02,374
There's a tremendous amount
     of flavor,

251
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:06,177
and your spice love,
    that whole piece.

252
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:07,646
The okra's
    been cooked down.

253
00:09:07,648 --> 00:09:11,016
Love the little pop
    of the corn.

254
00:09:11,018 --> 00:09:12,651
The tofu is the kicker.

255
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:14,386
I'm not missing the chicken
    in that at all.

256
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:16,054
I'm not missing the shrimp
    or the sausage.

257
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:18,423
That just reminds me of
  what you can do with tofu

258
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:20,625
and how well it takes on
    other flavors.

259
00:09:23,864 --> 00:09:25,497
All day long, girl.

260
00:09:25,499 --> 00:09:27,465
- Here's the gumbo for you.
   -Awesome.

261
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:29,000
Man, it just gave me a ray

262
00:09:29,002 --> 00:09:31,136
of flavors
 that I can really enjoy.

263
00:09:31,138 --> 00:09:33,471
People that I know usually
 like soul food,

264
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:35,574
and to give them
another variation of it,

265
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:36,975
that really impresses them.

266
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:39,210
But it wasn't easy
  getting to this point.

267
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:40,912
Tamearra came through
  a tough childhood

268
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:43,048
with a determination
  to follow her dream,

269
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:46,818
but that meant
 putting everything on the line.

270
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,787
You're a single mom
    at the time.
  Yeah.

271
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:52,924
To quit a really good job
   in the medical field

272
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,660
to go sell food
    at an open market

273
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:58,663
to come and take
an abandoned restaurant building

274
00:09:58,665 --> 00:10:00,865
and to do it all
   at a very young age.

275
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:03,768
I want people to feel good.

276
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,004
I'm not even a vegan.
 I just really like coming here.

277
00:10:06,006 --> 00:10:08,139
When I eat here,
 I feel healthier when I leave.

278
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:09,941
Here's your po' boy and fries.

279
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,576
This is one
 of my favorite sandwiches.

280
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:14,613
Just the seitan and the way
it's cooked and prepared

281
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:16,815
brings in
a lot of the flavor.

282
00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:18,116
Take me to po' boy town.

283
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,517
Okay, so first we're gonna make

284
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,586
the seitan vital wheat
 gluten flour.

285
00:10:21,588 --> 00:10:22,954
It's the protein
 of whole wheat.

286
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,322
That's what
    I thought it was.

287
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:28,960
Liquid amino acid,
 blended seaweed.

288
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:30,428
- Okay.
   -Fresh garlic,

289
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:31,863
and I have my love spice.

290
00:10:31,865 --> 00:10:33,164
Form this
 into a ball here.

291
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:37,402
Now, does this need
     to set up,

292
00:10:37,404 --> 00:10:39,270
It boils for about 45 minutes
  to an hour.

293
00:10:39,272 --> 00:10:40,839
We're gonna cut
 these into cubes.

294
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:42,040
There's some texture
     there.

295
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:43,775
Then we're gonna dredge it.
 Wet batter first.

296
00:10:43,777 --> 00:10:44,843
What's in the wet batter?

297
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:47,679
Unbleached flour,
 love spice, water.

298
00:10:47,681 --> 00:10:51,483
And then we have the dry batter,
which is flour and cornmeal.

299
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:52,717
We're gonna fry this off?

300
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:53,952
That's right.

301
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:56,154
- Now what are we gonna make?
  -Our "vegan mayo."

302
00:10:56,156 --> 00:11:00,392
Great.
So, we're starting
 with silken tofu,

303
00:11:00,394 --> 00:11:02,427
and I'm gonna add
some coarse black pepper,

304
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:03,595
a little yellow mustard

305
00:11:03,597 --> 00:11:05,897
and granulated garlic,
  sea salt.

306
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:08,466
Mix together
and put it in the refrigerator

307
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:09,901
overnight
 for it to set.

308
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:11,336
Okay.
    Po' boy time.

309
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:13,872
All right, so I have my Dutch
crunch bread that I toasted,

310
00:11:13,874 --> 00:11:16,941
and then I have
my vegan mayo, mustard,

311
00:11:16,943 --> 00:11:18,877
tomatoes,
 shredded lettuce.

312
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:20,011
Okay. I like it.

313
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:22,347
And then I have my seitan.

314
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:23,948
A little bit more mayo,

315
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:26,785
squeeze a little lemon juice.

316
00:11:26,787 --> 00:11:29,721
It weighs about ten pounds,
    just so you know.

317
00:11:34,261 --> 00:11:37,395
I don't know exactly what
    po' boy I'm having,

318
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:38,930
but there's no question,
    that's a po' boy.

319
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:39,931
All right.

320
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:41,566
The Dutch crunch
   is a perfect choice.

321
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:42,767
The lettuce is cut right.

322
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:45,770
The tomato's great on there.

323
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:48,339
The vegan mayo,
    that's lights out.

324
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:50,842
I mean, we got to get a tub
   of that for my house.

325
00:11:50,844 --> 00:11:53,344
But the home run
    is the seitan

326
00:11:53,346 --> 00:11:55,480
with that little bit
    of the nori.

327
00:11:55,482 --> 00:11:56,815
I'm not kidding you.
    It's the real deal.

328
00:11:56,817 --> 00:11:58,116
I know, don't come down

329
00:11:58,118 --> 00:12:00,852
expecting it
    to be fried shrimp.

330
00:12:00,854 --> 00:12:03,221
Come down just expecting it
 to be a really good po' boy.

331
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:06,157
I think you're gonna dig it.
     Mmm.

332
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:07,459
Po' boy with fries up.

333
00:12:07,461 --> 00:12:09,294
It's some of the best seitan
    that I've ever had.

334
00:12:09,296 --> 00:12:11,129
It's one of the best po' boys
  I've ever had, actually.

335
00:12:11,131 --> 00:12:12,230
It is a bomb po' boy.

336
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:14,132
I love po' boys,
   and this is delicious.

337
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:15,600
I would say
 this is about as healthy

338
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:17,402
as fried Southern food can get.

339
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:18,837
- You have another one?
  -I do have another one.

340
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:21,005
You got another trick?
   It's not even a trick.

341
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:22,974
Black bean and quinoa burger up.

342
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:25,610
You feel very satisfied
  after eating it.

343
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:27,278
This girl can get it going.
  See you in a little bit.

344
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,947
- All right.
 -I got to finish the po' boy.

345
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:36,154
Welcome back.
    Hanging out here

346
00:12:36,156 --> 00:12:38,423
in Oakland, California,
    at Souley Vegan.

347
00:12:39,693 --> 00:12:41,926
Now, my sister, Morgan,
   was a vegetarian/vegan.

348
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:44,162
And so this is something that's
  near and dear to my heart.

349
00:12:44,164 --> 00:12:45,396
I know everybody
   sees me on "Triple D,"

350
00:12:45,398 --> 00:12:47,899
and they say, "Oh, that guy
  eats a bunch of nachos."

351
00:12:47,901 --> 00:12:49,067
I like my nachos.

352
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:51,970
But this food
   makes you feel good.

353
00:12:51,972 --> 00:12:53,404
Here you are.

354
00:12:53,406 --> 00:12:54,839
There's actually a lot of things

355
00:12:54,841 --> 00:12:56,141
that you can make
  with vegan food,

356
00:12:56,143 --> 00:12:59,144
and I feel like Souley Vegan
  really takes that on.

357
00:12:59,146 --> 00:13:01,813
The things that they do
  are done so well,

358
00:13:01,815 --> 00:13:03,181
you don't miss the meat at all.

359
00:13:03,183 --> 00:13:04,983
We had the black bean
  and quinoa burger.

360
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:07,385
The quinoa black bean
 veggie burger tastes different

361
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:09,387
than any other veggie burger
   I've had.

362
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:11,022
A great burger
  if it's your first time

363
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:13,424
eating a vegetarian burger.

364
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:15,393
Quinoa is one of
     the superfoods.
  Mm-hmm.

365
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:17,796
If you haven't done quinoa,
    give it a shot.

366
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:19,731
So, we're gonna start
with our olive oil, onions.

367
00:13:19,733 --> 00:13:21,733
We're just gonna
let those caramelize,

368
00:13:21,735 --> 00:13:23,601
put a little bit
of the love spice in here.

369
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:25,970
Add in the cilantro,
     basil.

370
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:27,472
And then we have our parsley,

371
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:30,074
and then I have my black beans
 and my quinoa.

372
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:31,309
It's a good look
    right there.

373
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:32,777
Now we're gonna make it
    into some patties.

374
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:34,045
Yep. All right.

375
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:36,381
Add some brown rice flour.

376
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:39,184
Just add a little bit
more of my love seasoning.

377
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:42,420
- To a patty?
   -Mm-hmm.

378
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:43,655
How we gonna cook them?

379
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:45,523
- Bake them.
  -We're gonna bake them?

380
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:47,025
- Mm-hmm.
   -Here we go.

381
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:48,693
Now we're gonna
 dress the burger.

382
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:50,361
I have my mayo,

383
00:13:50,363 --> 00:13:52,831
a little ketchup
on the bottom there,

384
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,766
burger on there,

385
00:13:54,768 --> 00:13:57,335
a little bit more sauce on top,
 ketchup there.

386
00:13:57,337 --> 00:14:00,872
Alfalfa sprouts
and a slice of tomato,

387
00:14:00,874 --> 00:14:03,608
and that is how we serve the
black bean and quinoa burger.

388
00:14:07,113 --> 00:14:08,847
We got all the things
  you love about a burger.

389
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:10,281
You got meaty texture.

390
00:14:10,283 --> 00:14:11,950
It's big,
   it's thick, it's rich.

391
00:14:11,952 --> 00:14:16,054
Nice bun, a little tomato,
    a little ketchup.

392
00:14:16,056 --> 00:14:18,823
The quinoa mix
  to the black bean is great.

393
00:14:18,825 --> 00:14:20,458
Definitely get that mayo
  component coming through.

394
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:23,628
It's a great burger.

395
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,330
Black bean and quinoa burger up.

396
00:14:25,332 --> 00:14:26,831
It's full of different flavors.

397
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,199
It's really hearty.

398
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:29,634
The po' boy here with fry.

399
00:14:29,636 --> 00:14:33,004
I'm always confident
 that Souley Vegan can deliver

400
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:35,206
on a culinary experience
 that's worth remembering.

401
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,741
The profile
   of what you're doing

402
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:39,377
for vegan food,
   you're the real deal.

403
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:40,678
Right on. Thank you.

404
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,015
Well done, girl.

405
00:14:44,017 --> 00:14:47,719
Up next, we're rolling to
the central valley to Modesto...

406
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:48,786
It doesn't stop.

407
00:14:48,788 --> 00:14:51,089
...for some international
   inspiration...

408
00:14:51,091 --> 00:14:53,558
If you talk about a really
traditional Portuguese dish,

409
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,059
this is right up there.

410
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:57,262
...traveling full-speed
   to Flavortown.

411
00:14:57,264 --> 00:14:59,731
- The Lamburgerini.
  -Sports car of burgers.

412
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:08,740
So, the next time
 you're in Modesto, California,

413
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:10,408
getting your hair
  tightened up over here

414
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:14,512
at the Barber Salon
 at McHenry Village at 66A,

415
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:16,247
and you say to yourself, "Self,

416
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,149
I'd really like to have
  some Portuguese,

417
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:19,517
German-inspired food.

418
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:20,518
Where should I eat?"

419
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,719
Oh, you step right next door

420
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:24,923
to Bauer's 66 1/2
  Skillet and Grill.

421
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,726
Two UFBs, medium.

422
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:30,395
It's one of those places
  where you kind of want

423
00:15:30,397 --> 00:15:32,063
to keep it to yourself.

424
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:33,598
I get cravings all the time.

425
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,566
All right,
  here's that Lamburgini.

426
00:15:35,568 --> 00:15:37,735
If you have a passion
   for burgers,

427
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:39,070
definitely a good spot.

428
00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:41,439
Or a passion
 for some global-infused grub...

429
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:42,874
Gorg burger.

430
00:15:42,876 --> 00:15:45,209
...thanks to chef and
 owner Tye Bauer's background.

431
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:46,511
My dad's
   a full-blooded German.

432
00:15:46,513 --> 00:15:47,979
My mom was
  full-blooded Portuguese.

433
00:15:47,981 --> 00:15:49,480
...and his adventures.

434
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:51,049
I traveled a lot,
  so I just take a little bit

435
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:53,885
of a hodgepodge of my heritage
  and things that I liked.

436
00:15:53,887 --> 00:15:56,654
Which led him to create
 this Portuguese-inspired,

437
00:15:56,656 --> 00:15:58,790
three-meat monster sandwich.

438
00:15:58,792 --> 00:15:59,958
Octavian.

439
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:04,262
You get the linguica.
  You get the alcatra.

440
00:16:04,264 --> 00:16:07,899
We're into a Portuguese
 braised beef called alcatra.

441
00:16:07,901 --> 00:16:09,968
The alcatra is part
    of our Octavian.

442
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:12,470
If you talk about a really
traditional Portuguese dish,

443
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:14,772
this is right up there?
   -That's right.

444
00:16:14,774 --> 00:16:16,240
- Okay.
 -I'm gonna season it up.

445
00:16:16,242 --> 00:16:17,575
First
  a little red wine vinegar.

446
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:19,344
Next we have white wine.
    -Okay.

447
00:16:19,346 --> 00:16:20,745
All right, and then
   we're gonna do red wine

448
00:16:20,747 --> 00:16:22,180
to just about cover.

449
00:16:22,182 --> 00:16:23,314
Beef stock.

450
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:27,051
Organic tomato sauce,
    some brown sugar.

451
00:16:27,053 --> 00:16:29,220
Now a virtual cornucopia

452
00:16:29,222 --> 00:16:30,955
of all the spices
 we have available.

453
00:16:30,957 --> 00:16:32,323
Yes.

454
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:35,893
Chopped garlic, coriander,
  granulated onion, cumin,

455
00:16:35,895 --> 00:16:39,397
black pepper,
  smoked paprika, paprika.

456
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:41,032
Then we're gonna add
   all our sweet spices.

457
00:16:41,034 --> 00:16:43,301
Nutmeg first,
 a little Vietnamese cinnamon.

458
00:16:43,303 --> 00:16:44,836
It's a little sweeter.
     Allspice.

459
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:46,337
And last but not least,
     clove.

460
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:49,107
One cinnamon stick
    and some bay leaf.

461
00:16:49,109 --> 00:16:51,509
Alcatra goes in the refrigerator
     24 hours.

462
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:53,144
Then we're gonna braise it
in the oven for how long?

463
00:16:53,146 --> 00:16:54,245
For about five hours.

464
00:16:54,247 --> 00:16:55,747
300 degrees.

465
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:57,015
All right, so now
 what are we into?

466
00:16:57,017 --> 00:16:58,516
Linguica,
    Portuguese sausage.

467
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:00,251
Really simple,
    but a long process.

468
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:01,386
And how does it get served?

469
00:17:01,388 --> 00:17:03,021
- It's part of our Octavian.
   -Got it.

470
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:04,856
A cubed pork butt,
    some red wine,

471
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,557
chili paste,
    garlic's going in.

472
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,593
Salt.

473
00:17:08,595 --> 00:17:09,827
Black pepper.

474
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:12,797
Allspice, paprika,
    Hungarian paprika.

475
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,332
So, a little hot paprika.

476
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:15,400
- Yeah.
    -Okay.

477
00:17:15,402 --> 00:17:16,434
Mix it all up.

478
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:19,203
24 hours,
 then we grind it.

479
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:20,738
Go to the casing.

480
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:23,541
I'm gonna smoke that up
    for about 12 hours.

481
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:25,543
Okay, all right, let's get
into making the sandwich.

482
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,912
So, chopped up some linguica
    for our Octavian.

483
00:17:27,914 --> 00:17:29,647
I'm gonna add some mushrooms
    and onions to that.

484
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:32,683
Gonna bring that over here
    to the pulled pork.

485
00:17:32,685 --> 00:17:34,152
This, we do this in-house.

486
00:17:34,154 --> 00:17:35,653
Then we're gonna come in
    with the alcatra.

487
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:38,056
- How many people are eating?
 -It's a big boy's sandwich.

488
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:39,891
All right,
  so now the cheese goes in.

489
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:42,860
And then
   our sweet spicy sauce.

490
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:43,861
Bring this all together here.

491
00:17:43,863 --> 00:17:45,696
We're gonna add that
     to the bun.

492
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:49,834
All right,
   and there we have it.

493
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:51,636
Boy,
that's a big sandwich, man.

494
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:56,641
Mmm.

495
00:17:56,643 --> 00:17:58,276
It's just a ton
 of flavor going on.
       Yeah.

496
00:17:58,278 --> 00:17:59,477
Let me get a little bite
 of the linguica,

497
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:01,379
then and also get a little touch
 of that vinegar.

498
00:18:05,351 --> 00:18:07,452
I see the calorie meter
going off right next to me,

499
00:18:07,454 --> 00:18:08,686
minutes on treadmill.

500
00:18:08,688 --> 00:18:10,588
Ding, ding, ding, ding!

501
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,856
Great sandwich, man.
   -Thank you.

502
00:18:11,858 --> 00:18:14,192
- Nicely done.
 -Here's that Octavian sandwich.

503
00:18:14,194 --> 00:18:15,693
It's a monster sandwich.

504
00:18:15,695 --> 00:18:17,628
Three different types of meat.
 You can't really go wrong.

505
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,964
From the Octavian
  to the UFB sandwich,

506
00:18:19,966 --> 00:18:22,033
everything here's got
  a clever little name,

507
00:18:22,035 --> 00:18:23,634
including the one Tye
   rolled with

508
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:25,069
when he opened in '09.

509
00:18:25,071 --> 00:18:27,572
The 66 1/2 came in
   because of the address.

510
00:18:27,574 --> 00:18:30,007
We're on the back side
   of a place that's 66.

511
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:33,678
I could have been an E.
   -66E or 66A.

512
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,913
I had a choice,
   so I went with 66 1/2.

513
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:37,682
But his best work
  might be reserved

514
00:18:37,684 --> 00:18:40,751
for the name he's bestowed
 on this beast of a burger.

515
00:18:40,753 --> 00:18:41,953
Lamburgerini.

516
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:44,021
- The Lamburgerini?
  -Sports car of burgers.

517
00:18:44,023 --> 00:18:45,490
He doesn't stop.

518
00:18:45,492 --> 00:18:47,391
It's just moist,
 and it melts in your mouth.

519
00:18:47,393 --> 00:18:48,860
You're going 100 miles an hour,

520
00:18:48,862 --> 00:18:50,461
but you still get
  to enjoy the ride.

521
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:52,163
All right, bring it.
     All right,
   we're gonna start off.

522
00:18:52,165 --> 00:18:54,599
We got
   our Bauer salty spice.

523
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:56,534
That's gonna be shaked
   into the ground lamb.

524
00:18:56,536 --> 00:18:57,535
- Okay.
   -Start out with

525
00:18:57,537 --> 00:18:58,836
some kosher salt,

526
00:18:58,838 --> 00:19:02,006
coarse black pepper,
  granulated garlic, cumin.

527
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:03,407
Granulated onion.
   -Coriander.

528
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:05,476
- Smoked paprika.
  -Hungarian paprika.

529
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:07,545
And this is New Mexican
 chili powder, a little spice.

530
00:19:07,547 --> 00:19:11,215
Looks like the spice market
  in Bahrain.

531
00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:13,684
Or it reminds me of sand castle
making in third grade,

532
00:19:13,686 --> 00:19:15,319
but I'm gonna go with
 the Bahrain thing.

533
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:18,189
I want to take this
   and just shake it up.

534
00:19:18,191 --> 00:19:19,423
All right,
now what are we into?

535
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:21,626
All right, so we cubed up
    our lamb shoulder.

536
00:19:21,628 --> 00:19:23,528
- Got it.
- Gonna add a pinch of the sumac.

537
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:25,029
It's a Middle Eastern spice,

538
00:19:25,031 --> 00:19:26,330
got a little
    orange peel to it.

539
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:29,267
Then we got our
   salty spice we made.

540
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:30,768
Was Salty Spice
 one of the girls

541
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,203
that was kicked out of
 the Spice Girls?

542
00:19:32,205 --> 00:19:34,605
She was.
     Our garlic.

543
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:35,740
Add a little
 lemon olive oil.

544
00:19:35,742 --> 00:19:36,874
Lemon olive oil.

545
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:38,409
Grind it out,
form it into patties.

546
00:19:38,411 --> 00:19:40,478
We're gonna put it on the char
   griller here for about

547
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,246
7 minutes a side.
   -Fantastic.

548
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:44,081
So we got our
   toasted brioche bun.

549
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:45,850
Gonna be that spicy
    Thousand Island.

550
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:46,984
Lemon aioli.

551
00:19:46,986 --> 00:19:49,220
Here comes the Lamburgerini.
   -Lamburgerini?

552
00:19:49,222 --> 00:19:50,221
- Yeah.
    -Okay.

553
00:19:50,223 --> 00:19:51,789
And we got our mushrooms,
     bacon,

554
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,858
and gorgonzola that's gonna
    go on top of that.

555
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,560
Next thing coming up
     is arugula.

556
00:19:55,562 --> 00:19:56,594
Olive oil.

557
00:19:56,596 --> 00:19:58,329
There you have it.

558
00:20:01,668 --> 00:20:04,535
Italanced, properly cooked,
really moist, tons of flavor.

559
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:06,437
Toasted bun
 holds it together.

560
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:07,905
The aioli's great.

561
00:20:07,907 --> 00:20:11,375
That's actually what a lot
of lamb burgers want to be.

562
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:12,710
Thank you, man. Yeah.

563
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:14,445
Spot on, Tye.
  Spot on.

564
00:20:14,447 --> 00:20:17,181
- Here's that Lamburgini.
  -It's phenomenal.

565
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:19,850
When I eat it,
 I don't care about my diet.

566
00:20:19,852 --> 00:20:21,752
I just come here,
 and I enjoy this burger.

567
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:23,254
- You just get after it.
    -Yep.

568
00:20:23,256 --> 00:20:25,656
It's just the best place
 around here that I've been to.

569
00:20:25,658 --> 00:20:27,725
It's the best place in a lot
  of places I've been to.

570
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,794
You take the time
 to make everything.

571
00:20:29,796 --> 00:20:31,896
That's what makes this place
  so cool.

572
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:33,731
Nicely done.

573
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:36,901
Was that a road trip or what?
  But don't worry.

574
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:39,770
There's plenty more joints
 all over this great country.

575
00:20:39,772 --> 00:20:43,307
I'll be looking
for you next time on "Triple D."

576
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:45,243
This is Becca.
Becca's my assistant.

577
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:46,510
Ready?
 -Oh, I'm ready for this.

578
00:20:51,517 --> 00:20:53,451
Please make sure
that makes the show.

1
00:00:01,535 --> 00:00:02,868
          I'm Guy Fieri
     and we're rolling out,

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:04,236
      looking for America's
        greatest diners,

3
00:00:04,238 --> 00:00:06,705
      drive-ins and dives.

4
00:00:06,707 --> 00:00:08,707
          This trip...
             Suwee!

5
00:00:08,709 --> 00:00:10,275
 We're headed into the smoker...

6
00:00:10,277 --> 00:00:12,411
              Wow.
      Onto the flat top...

7
00:00:12,413 --> 00:00:14,546
             Mm-hmm.
   And down into the fryer...

8
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:16,615
   That's fried chicken city.
            In Miami.

9
00:00:16,617 --> 00:00:18,650
       See, he didn't take
any television bite right there.

10
00:00:18,652 --> 00:00:20,185
     A legit charcuterie...

11
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:21,453
 Where's this been all my life?

12
00:00:21,455 --> 00:00:23,756
          House-makin'
       some meaty magic...

13
00:00:23,758 --> 00:00:25,224
 We've got life-changing bacon.

14
00:00:25,226 --> 00:00:27,393
     In Modesto, California.
              Cut.

15
00:00:27,395 --> 00:00:29,461
   A monster taco trifecta...

16
00:00:29,463 --> 00:00:30,996
        We've just about
        gone ridiculous.

17
00:00:30,998 --> 00:00:33,699
      Alongside a breakfast
          lunch mashup.

18
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:35,601
     We're making a sandwich
       out of the waffle?

19
00:00:35,603 --> 00:00:36,668
     And over in Stockton...

20
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:37,936
    Oh, look at her go, now.

21
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:39,304
    A sporty husband-and-wife

22
00:00:39,306 --> 00:00:40,506
             team...
           All right.

23
00:00:40,508 --> 00:00:43,008
           We're good.
  Gets saucy with their wings.

24
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:48,547
      This is just a funky,
          crunchy wing.

25
00:01:01,295 --> 00:01:03,062
 So, I'm here in Miami, Florida

26
00:01:03,064 --> 00:01:04,863
        in an area known
        as Little Havana.

27
00:01:04,865 --> 00:01:07,099
       And I haven't been
     here since, like, 2009.

28
00:01:07,101 --> 00:01:08,267
       It's been too long.

29
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:09,701
    Here to check out a joint

30
00:01:09,703 --> 00:01:12,371
  where two high school buddies
  took a wild catering project

31
00:01:12,373 --> 00:01:13,906
    and turned it, literally,

32
00:01:13,908 --> 00:01:16,075
  into an artisan pig emporium.

33
00:01:16,077 --> 00:01:18,544
    So we got Miami Smokers.

34
00:01:18,546 --> 00:01:20,979
     You're gonna dig this.

35
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:25,384
         MAN: These are
    bacon-wrapped plantains.

36
00:01:25,386 --> 00:01:27,586
    From a block away you can
    actually smell the smoke.

37
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:29,388
      And it just leads you
  right into the front doorway.

38
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:30,656
  MAN: Barbecue Boar, order up.

39
00:01:30,658 --> 00:01:31,957
  We don't have a lot of, like,

40
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:33,559
       smokehouses here in
         south Florida.

41
00:01:33,561 --> 00:01:34,860
     So to smell that smell,

42
00:01:34,862 --> 00:01:36,528
     it reminds me of being
  in somewhere like Tennessee.

43
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,398
             FIERI:
 That's where Andres Barrientos
        and James Bowers

44
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,600
   picked up their mad curing
       and smoking skills

45
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:44,002
         before bringin'
        it back to Miami.

46
00:01:44,004 --> 00:01:46,839
 MAN: It started off as a pop-up
  brunch, started making bacon.

47
00:01:46,841 --> 00:01:50,342
       Before long, we're
  in full-on bacon production.

48
00:01:50,344 --> 00:01:52,878
       FIERI: Which led to
       a charcuterie joint

49
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,746
 servin' up sandwiches in 2014.

50
00:01:54,748 --> 00:01:56,081
      Order up,
   two Floridians.

51
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:58,684
     The Floridian sandwich
     is absolutely amazing.

52
00:01:58,686 --> 00:02:00,018
       It's made from wild boar.

53
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,386
  MAN: Grind 'em in-house into
            sausage.

54
00:02:01,388 --> 00:02:03,322
   It's a delicious sandwich.

55
00:02:03,324 --> 00:02:04,556
       What kinda sausage
         are we makin'?

56
00:02:04,558 --> 00:02:06,458
So this is what we call
our Floridian sausage.

57
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,393
   I am Floridian.
I was born and raised here.

58
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:09,728
              You are a Flor...
              Born and raised?

59
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,864
                   Represent.
Sea salt, fresh sage...

60
00:02:11,866 --> 00:02:15,033
                  'Kay.
     Garlic, cayenne pepper,

61
00:02:15,035 --> 00:02:18,070
paprika, fresh thyme,
   toasted anise,

62
00:02:18,072 --> 00:02:20,339
   toasted fennel,
toasted peppercorns,

63
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:22,241
tricolored pepper melange...

64
00:02:22,243 --> 00:02:24,543
            Pepper melange.
Yeah?

65
00:02:24,545 --> 00:02:26,111
       I feel like I should have
                  an ascot

66
00:02:26,113 --> 00:02:27,312
      when I say pepper melange,

67
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:29,114
                with a pipe.

68
00:02:29,116 --> 00:02:30,649
     And these citrus zests.

69
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:33,018
   We use wild boar for this.
       Seasoning in here.

70
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,052
                   Got it.
                 All right.

71
00:02:34,054 --> 00:02:35,320
         So this thing's
       pretty well mixed.

72
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:37,823
         We go grinder.

73
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:38,824
     Then, we bring it over here

74
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:40,292
            and mix it together.
             Right.

75
00:02:40,294 --> 00:02:42,394
  You need to mix it to achieve
  primary bind, in other words,

76
00:02:42,396 --> 00:02:44,096
         to get the meat
     to stick back together.

77
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:45,531
      You can smell that fennel.

78
00:02:45,533 --> 00:02:47,966
    You can pick all that citrus
             comin' outta there.

79
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:49,701
   These are pretubed casings.

80
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:51,270
                    Wow.

81
00:02:51,272 --> 00:02:54,239
     Off we go to the races.

82
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:56,375
  Allow a little bit of that air
                to come out.

83
00:02:56,377 --> 00:02:58,010
Not explode the sausage.

84
00:02:58,012 --> 00:03:00,646
        So this will get twisted
                by hand now?

85
00:03:00,648 --> 00:03:01,780
              We're ready to go.
Mm-hmm.

86
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:04,316
   Sausage goes in
the oven for a little bit...

87
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:06,385
 And then finished on a flat top
 and then assemble the sandwich.

88
00:03:06,387 --> 00:03:09,121
     Start off with a little
   baguette, avocado purée...

89
00:03:09,123 --> 00:03:10,956
             Floridian sausage.

90
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,991
 Spicy mayo, pickled peppers...
                Pickled peppers.

91
00:03:12,993 --> 00:03:16,061
         Pickled onions,
    a couple orange segments.

92
00:03:16,063 --> 00:03:17,329
          I've had a lot of dogs
             around the country.

93
00:03:17,331 --> 00:03:18,864
         I've never seen anybody
             put orange on 'em.

94
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:20,599
   First time for everything.

95
00:03:25,339 --> 00:03:26,672
       Nicely done, chef.

96
00:03:26,674 --> 00:03:28,240
   Nice little spice on that.

97
00:03:30,344 --> 00:03:31,810
         You definitely
       get the wild boar.

98
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:33,145
      You get a little bit
        of that gaminess,

99
00:03:33,147 --> 00:03:34,413
       a little more lean

100
00:03:34,415 --> 00:03:35,847
    than the typical sausage
  I think people would expect.

101
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:37,950
     You get tons of citrus
  coming through from the zest.

102
00:03:37,952 --> 00:03:42,020
   Love the citrus that you do
 with the fresh orange on there.

103
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:43,722
        That's a dynamite
        sausage sandwich.

104
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:44,957
           Fantastic.

105
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,124
             Floridian sausage.

106
00:03:46,126 --> 00:03:47,659
        That rich flavor
         in the sausage

107
00:03:47,661 --> 00:03:50,295
 and then the pickled vegetables
   just add a lightness to it.

108
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:52,431
    FIERI: Even former Miami
         Marlins catcher

109
00:03:52,433 --> 00:03:55,667
         Charles Johnson
  goes to bat for this big dog.

110
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:57,469
       See, he didn't take
any television bite right there,

111
00:03:57,471 --> 00:03:58,704
        ladies and gentlemen.
Mm.

112
00:03:58,706 --> 00:04:00,072
  I really love it.
That sausage is really good.

113
00:04:00,074 --> 00:04:02,507
      Best sausage sandwich
 you can have in south Florida.

114
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:06,078
    So I've had the fortunate
  opportunity to be associated

115
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,980
    with a great organization
     known as Best Buddies.

116
00:04:07,982 --> 00:04:10,182
   And it was formed by a good
friend of mine, Anthony Shriver.

117
00:04:10,184 --> 00:04:12,117
         This is Chris.
       And this is Aaron.

118
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:13,919
          And I thought
      these two characters,

119
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:15,487
       they made some time
       in their schedule,

120
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:16,922
   would come down and tell me
       what they thought.

121
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:18,390
  So, first, how was the slaw?

122
00:04:18,392 --> 00:04:21,393
I think it's really tasty,
   and I like it.

123
00:04:21,395 --> 00:04:23,862
 Put him in a chef coat, and now
   he's tryin' to take my job.

124
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:26,198
    If you bleach your hair,
 we're gonna have a big problem.

125
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,967
 Okay? Did you try the plantains
      wrapped in the bacon?

126
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:31,903
                    Yeah.
              That's delicious.

127
00:04:31,905 --> 00:04:34,273
       That was delicious.

128
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:35,841
    MAN: The sweet plantains
        and the guava...

129
00:04:35,843 --> 00:04:38,310
      Guava's a huge thing
         here in Miami.

130
00:04:38,312 --> 00:04:39,711
    So we're doin' bacon now.

131
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:40,979
   And I see no nitrate here.

132
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:42,881
Only nitrate's gonna come
   from sea salt,

133
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:45,317
naturally occurring in sea salt.
             Got it.

134
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:47,152
        sea salt, cumin,

135
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:48,754
       red pepper flakes,
        makes it so good.

136
00:04:48,756 --> 00:04:50,756
     So we use an antibiotic
           hormone...

137
00:04:50,758 --> 00:04:54,359
              Can you say suwee?
             Suwee!

138
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:57,029
    Hormone-free pork belly.
        Cures right here.

139
00:04:57,031 --> 00:04:59,698
Just gonna draw out the moisture
 from the pork, create a brine.

140
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,966
                And how long
             is this gonna cure?

141
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:02,167
           Two weeks.

142
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:03,268
    And then they get hung up

143
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,103
       in our aging cooler
        another 2 weeks.

144
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:08,774
     And how long in the smoker?
       48 hours.

145
00:05:08,776 --> 00:05:09,841
                    Whoa.

146
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:11,176
              So these will now
              go in the freezer

147
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:12,244
 so they tighten up a little bit

148
00:05:12,246 --> 00:05:13,845
       so they're easy to slice?
    Correct.

149
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:16,181
       And then we're gonna make
a plantain wrapped in the bacon?

150
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:17,683
            Correct.
        Sweet plantains,

151
00:05:17,685 --> 00:05:19,184
   let them ripen all the way.

152
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:21,520
     Roast 'em, turns black,
        and then it pops.

153
00:05:21,522 --> 00:05:22,554
             Pop it like it's...

154
00:05:22,556 --> 00:05:23,555
              Hot.
                      Thank you.

155
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:24,923
          Pretty much.
                    Bacon first.

156
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:26,325
            Plantain.
                   There you go.

157
00:05:26,327 --> 00:05:28,293
              This is the bacon
            without the nitrate.

158
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:30,462
              A little bit more
           of the natural color.

159
00:05:30,464 --> 00:05:32,898
      For people that have never
             had artisan bacon,

160
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,333
         they don't really quite
               understand it.

161
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,500
 The moment that they taste it,

162
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,669
         and they taste
real smoke flavor, life changes.

163
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:38,937
  We've got life-changing bacon.

164
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:41,540
   Cook 'em right in the oven,
           10 minutes.

165
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:43,675
        Five to an order,
         queso fresco...

166
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:46,545
                    Guava paste?
   This is a very Latin thing.

167
00:05:50,451 --> 00:05:52,217
      Oh, where's this been
          all my life?

168
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:54,152
  The combo between the salty,
           the cheese,

169
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:57,155
         the great smoke
    of the bacon: ridiculous.

170
00:05:57,157 --> 00:05:58,857
  The plantain is not as sweet
    as I thought it would be.

171
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:02,060
      But this guava purée
  that you guys make, dynamite.

172
00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:04,696
  It's a really great platform
  to present your bacon 'cause

173
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:06,064
          you can taste
       the bacon in there.

174
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:07,566
    Cool.
                 Well done, man.

175
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:09,368
  Here you guys go. Here's our
    bacon-wrapped plantains.

176
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,570
 The bacon was my favorite part.
        Like, I loved it.

177
00:06:11,572 --> 00:06:12,938
 Had a little taste
of a little guava to it.

178
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:13,972
                           Yeah.
   Outstanding.

179
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:16,375
        You played ball in Miami
                for how long?

180
00:06:16,377 --> 00:06:19,044
 Five to six years.
Won the World Series in 1997.

181
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:20,746
   How'd you find Miami Smokers?

182
00:06:20,748 --> 00:06:22,781
 We have a contest,
   Taste of Miami.

183
00:06:22,783 --> 00:06:24,082
Andres was our chef,

184
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:26,284
and he put on this nice
little barbecue sauce of mine.

185
00:06:26,286 --> 00:06:27,352
And it's called Catch This.

186
00:06:27,354 --> 00:06:29,721
A portion of my proceeds
   go back to, um,

187
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:31,123
trying to really revive baseball

188
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:32,858
 in a lot of places
 like inner cities.

189
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,126
        You're awesome, brother.
            Thank you very much.

190
00:06:34,128 --> 00:06:36,461
     Thank you.

191
00:06:36,463 --> 00:06:38,797
     No other place in Miami
       like Miami Smokers.

192
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:40,065
         Car is backed up there.

193
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:41,800
      You can just start loadin'
              up that bacon now

194
00:06:41,802 --> 00:06:43,568
                and the sausage.
All right. Gotcha.

195
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,004
Got it.
          Just load it over top.

196
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:48,340
      Up next, we're headed
          to Modesto...

197
00:06:48,342 --> 00:06:51,109
            Oh, boy.
 To a funky craft beer joint...

198
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:52,477
    It's everything you want.
             Pumpin'

199
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,646
   up their scratch-made menu.
              Yeah.

200
00:06:54,648 --> 00:06:56,481
         Well, it's only
    about 17 pounds of food.

201
00:07:01,455 --> 00:07:04,389
                     ♪

202
00:07:06,393 --> 00:07:07,726
I'm here in Modesto, California,

203
00:07:07,728 --> 00:07:09,327
          about an hour
      south of Sacramento.

204
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:10,429
  You're gonna love this story.

205
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:11,663
     Two high school buddies

206
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:13,732
   who live in separate parts
       of the state decide

207
00:07:13,734 --> 00:07:15,367
 to move back to Modesto 'cause

208
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:16,868
       it's a great place
    to raise their families.

209
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,303
   And they also decide, "Hey.

210
00:07:18,305 --> 00:07:20,272
      Why don't we open up
       a craft beer joint

211
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:21,773
  and make scratch-made food?"

212
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,308
         You gotta love
       the American dream.

213
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,043
      This is Commonwealth.

214
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:29,414
  I get cravings of this place
          all the time.

215
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:31,049
                Barbecue nachos?
    Wow.

216
00:07:31,051 --> 00:07:32,951
 I'm here multiple times a week.

217
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:36,922
     Beer is often the draw,
but the food will keep you here.

218
00:07:36,924 --> 00:07:39,024
     FIERI: Which is exactly
      how owners Jeff Brown

219
00:07:39,026 --> 00:07:40,792
  and Blake Humble drew it up.

220
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,260
          Kinda started
       as a craft beer bar

221
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:44,062
      but we wanted people
     to leave saying, "Damn.

222
00:07:44,064 --> 00:07:45,363
       That food's good."

223
00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:47,098
    FIERI: So they signed up
        chef Brian Lien.

224
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,900
 You got the meat for tacos yet?

225
00:07:48,902 --> 00:07:51,570
FIERI: Another hometown dude who
     turned Jeff and Blake's

226
00:07:51,572 --> 00:07:52,971
           dream menu
         into a reality

227
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:55,140
 with dishes like this trifecta.

228
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:57,042
     Order up, Craft Tacos.

229
00:07:57,044 --> 00:07:59,444
     FIERI: A banh mi taco,
       barbecue pork taco

230
00:07:59,446 --> 00:08:01,413
   and a buffalo chicken taco,

231
00:08:01,415 --> 00:08:04,115
          all piled on,
     you got it, one plate.

232
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:06,051
Honestly, I can't say
which one to start with.

233
00:08:06,053 --> 00:08:08,320
           Lovin' it,
    absolutely off the chart.

234
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:09,621
 FIERI: What are we gonna make?

235
00:08:09,623 --> 00:08:11,289
Some braised pulled pork.
                      All right.

236
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:12,858
                   Get after it.
    Rub this pork butt

237
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,259
         with some salt
           and pepper,

238
00:08:14,261 --> 00:08:15,861
       a little bit of oil
           in the pan.

239
00:08:15,863 --> 00:08:18,396
           So we'll sear this up
                on all sides.

240
00:08:18,398 --> 00:08:20,131
      Then we're gonna take
          the pork out

241
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:22,901
      and continue building
    our, uh, braising liquid.

242
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:24,769
      Bacon, some mirepoix,

243
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:27,672
             Boatload of garlic.
Chopped bell peppers...

244
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,641
    You sure get a wind up there
       with the throw, don't ya?

245
00:08:29,643 --> 00:08:32,210
  Fresh thyme, fresh rosemary,

246
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:34,412
           bay leaves,
         dried chilies,

247
00:08:34,414 --> 00:08:35,747
    chili powder, allspice...

248
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:37,582
                  Allspice.

249
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:39,951
                  Alcohol cider.
         Chicken stock.

250
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:42,454
      So we'll reduce this down.
    We're gonna transfer

251
00:08:42,456 --> 00:08:45,123
      that to a hotel pan,
      top it with our pork.

252
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:48,093
       In the oven 6 hours at...
     Three hundred degrees.

253
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:49,594
                Bring it out,
           let it cool, pull it?

254
00:08:49,596 --> 00:08:51,296
          That's right.
                      All right.

255
00:08:51,298 --> 00:08:52,597
                        Next up?
      We're gonna marinate

256
00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:54,733
  some chicken for our grilled
     chicken buffalo tacos.

257
00:08:54,735 --> 00:08:56,835
      So we have boneless,
    skinless chicken breast,

258
00:08:56,837 --> 00:08:58,203
        fresh tarragon...

259
00:08:58,205 --> 00:08:59,604
                  Tarragon?
            Tell me the premise.

260
00:08:59,606 --> 00:09:01,506
I just love tarragon on chicken.

261
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:02,841
           That was the premise.

262
00:09:02,843 --> 00:09:06,044
     Parsley, minced garlic,
           olive oil,

263
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:07,379
          mix that up.
           All right.

264
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:10,849
       So this is gonna go
     in the cooler 24 hours,

265
00:09:10,851 --> 00:09:13,118
    marked on the char grill,
      finished in the oven.

266
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,887
          Diced up, ready to go.
                  Next up?

267
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,956
    This is our umami sauce.
                         'Kay.

268
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,991
      It's gonna go on our,
        uh, banh mi taco.

269
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:21,626
                      All right.
      So we're gonna start

270
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:25,864
   with some vegetable stock,
     soy sauce, fish sauce.

271
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:27,866
      Really like those detailed
                measurements.

272
00:09:27,868 --> 00:09:29,668
          Raw bacon...

273
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,036
                Come on down
          to the carnival, kids.

274
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:32,871
     It's bobbin' for bacon here
              at Commonwealth.

275
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:35,173
             Full peppercorns...
        Full peppercorns.

276
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:36,741
           Star anise,

277
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:39,077
    cinnamon sticks, cloves,

278
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:42,781
     chopped ginger, onions,
         green onions...

279
00:09:42,783 --> 00:09:44,616
      How 'bout you just tell me
 the things that don't go in it?

280
00:09:44,618 --> 00:09:47,519
   Jalapenos, carrots, garlic,

281
00:09:47,521 --> 00:09:50,422
      toasted sesame seeds
        and brown sugar.

282
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:51,723
                 Okay then.

283
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:53,491
     Uh, this is gonna cook
      for about 90 minutes.

284
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:54,793
   Then we're gonna strain it.

285
00:09:54,795 --> 00:09:56,161
   And we're gonna hit it with
      a corn starch slurry.

286
00:09:56,163 --> 00:09:57,395
              That's on top of
             the banh mi taco...

287
00:09:57,397 --> 00:09:58,930
Right. That will get tossed
with the pulled pork.

288
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,065
                         Got it.
              Okay.

289
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:01,199
        We're gonna make
      our craft taco plate.

290
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:02,334
        We're gonna start

291
00:10:02,336 --> 00:10:05,503
    by heating our tortillas,
        dipped in water.

292
00:10:05,505 --> 00:10:06,771
      Throw down our meat,
    this is our pulled pork,

293
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:07,872
    by heating our tortillas,
    grilled chicken.ter.

294
00:10:07,874 --> 00:10:10,308
           All right.
         Our meat's hot.

295
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,711
           Let's start
      with our umami sauce,

296
00:10:12,713 --> 00:10:15,080
         barbecue sauce,
       our buffalo sauce.

297
00:10:15,082 --> 00:10:18,650
 We're gonna start in the middle
     with our banh mi taco.

298
00:10:18,652 --> 00:10:24,055
      Cilantro, jalapenos,
 pickled carrot and red radish.

299
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:25,357
                   Uh-huh.
                 That works.

300
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:26,725
 This over here is our buffalo.

301
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:29,027
 So that's gonna get house-made
     cole slaw, blue cheese,

302
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:30,562
      some diced tomatoes.

303
00:10:30,564 --> 00:10:33,198
        Then we'll start
    our barbecue pulled pork

304
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,300
   and our umami pulled pork.

305
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:37,469
    Grilled buffalo chicken.

306
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:39,137
  Back to our pulled pork taco,

307
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,472
         our ranch slaw.

308
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:41,873
   That's Sriracha mayonnaise.

309
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,742
         I'm gonna hold you back
 anymore ingredients after this.

310
00:10:43,744 --> 00:10:45,310
              We've just about
              gone ridiculous.

311
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,345
                      All right?
     Parsley and that's it.

312
00:10:51,518 --> 00:10:53,351
                Slaw's great,
            complements it well.

313
00:10:53,353 --> 00:10:55,787
   Barbecue sauce got some kick.

314
00:10:55,789 --> 00:10:58,723
             Banh mi, that's got
          your favorite flavors.

315
00:10:58,725 --> 00:11:01,226
      And that umami sauce, wow.

316
00:11:01,228 --> 00:11:05,330
        Next up, grilled chicken
                buffalo taco.

317
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:06,631
          There's so much flavor

318
00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:09,367
                in each one,
           big acid in this one,

319
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:12,103
           big salt in this one,
        big vinegar in this one.

320
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:13,371
                 Well done.
         Thank you, sir.

321
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:15,206
                 Well done.

322
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,042
    Fresh, clean, delicious.

323
00:11:17,044 --> 00:11:20,378
    This is my buddy, Ahmed,
  from Rock and Sole in London.

324
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,514
        I wanna find out,
       what does he think

325
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:25,817
       of some funky tacos
in a little town called Modesto?

326
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:28,920
   Lots of flavor,
all layered very nicely.

327
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:30,355
Absolutely hittin' the spot.

328
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:32,757
          Uh, it's got
   the perfect buffalo sauce.

329
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:35,260
The pork seems like it's been
 marinated for days.

330
00:11:35,262 --> 00:11:39,397
      Great food, great company,
              even better beer.

331
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:41,132
              Get beer from all
              over the country?

332
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:43,668
       All over the world.
   The craft beers are things

333
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,770
     that you will not find
     in the grocery stores.

334
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:48,139
        You can always get stuff
    that is your favorite, stuff

335
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:49,607
   you've never heard of before.

336
00:11:49,609 --> 00:11:51,409
  If you ever want a good meal
        and a good brew,

337
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:52,777
  come on down to Commonwealth.

338
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:54,913
  All right. So here's the deal,
             when we come back,

339
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:57,048
      chef says that he has just
                what I need:

340
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,617
         a waffle that has what?

341
00:11:59,619 --> 00:12:01,720
               Don't tell me.
              Get through this.

342
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:03,288
       I'll see you in a minute.

343
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:11,362
                     ♪

344
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:12,864
                     Hi.
    Welcome back to Commonwealth

345
00:12:12,866 --> 00:12:15,567
         in Modesto, California.

346
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:19,404
          I just had three tacos
      the size of four burritos.

347
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:21,106
And now I'm gonna have a waffle.

348
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:22,440
    How long on that waffle?

349
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:24,876
     It is a combination of
  breakfast, lunch and dinner.

350
00:12:24,878 --> 00:12:26,311
               Waffle Madame.

351
00:12:26,313 --> 00:12:28,079
       It's just amazing.

352
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,681
              All right, chef.

353
00:12:29,683 --> 00:12:31,449
                Tell me about
             this wonder waffle.

354
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:33,585
    First we're gonna mix up
      our dry ingredients,

355
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:35,787
       all purpose flour,
        granulated sugar,

356
00:12:35,789 --> 00:12:36,955
         bakin' powder,

357
00:12:36,957 --> 00:12:38,523
          kosher salt.
                           'Kay.

358
00:12:38,525 --> 00:12:42,093
  Now for our wet ingredients,
       eggs, buttermilk...

359
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:45,029
         So far, this just looks
    like a regular waffle, chef.

360
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:47,265
     Well, it's the sandwich
     that's most impressive.

361
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,433
           Vanilla...

362
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:49,601
         We're making a sandwich
             out of the waffle?

363
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:52,036
          We are making
    a Waffle Madame sandwich.

364
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:55,406
              Cut. I didn't say
          I was into any sand...

365
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:56,875
          Ah, you're killin' me.

366
00:12:56,877 --> 00:12:59,744
                I'm gonna --
   never gonna get the car home.

367
00:12:59,746 --> 00:13:01,012
               I'm gonna have
             to Fred Flintstone

368
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:04,115
            that thing, take out
     the floorboard again and...

369
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,116
         Melted butter.

370
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,085
   Addin' our dry to our wet.

371
00:13:07,087 --> 00:13:09,020
           You're making waffles
                  all day?

372
00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:10,155
 Yeah, the customer's favorite.

373
00:13:10,157 --> 00:13:11,890
   You make the waffle to order?

374
00:13:11,892 --> 00:13:13,324
        To order and then
     we build the sandwich.

375
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:16,227
 It's gonna cook for 2 minutes.

376
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:18,263
  All right. Our waffle's done.

377
00:13:18,265 --> 00:13:19,430
   We're gonna cut it in half.

378
00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:22,167
          Swiss cheese.

379
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:24,969
We're gonna cook our home fries,
      maple mustard butter.

380
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:26,971
      So that's just the butter,

381
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:29,240
               the maple syrup
    and the whole grain mustard?

382
00:13:29,242 --> 00:13:30,475
      Whole grain mustard.

383
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:31,676
          And our ham.

384
00:13:31,678 --> 00:13:32,844
               If waffle's not
             good enough for ya,

385
00:13:32,846 --> 00:13:37,015
               let's just cook
        your ham in some butter.

386
00:13:37,017 --> 00:13:39,284
                 Those eggs
   better not be goin' on there.

387
00:13:39,286 --> 00:13:41,553
          And our eggs.
           All right.

388
00:13:41,555 --> 00:13:44,622
       Our ham's hot, move
    that over to our waffle.

389
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:47,325
       And our other half.

390
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:51,062
 And your favorite right on top.

391
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:53,631
     So chef, I know that you're
          a big fan of the eggs.

392
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:55,033
               I'm gonna just
       pull this right over here

393
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:57,035
and just allow them to be yours.
You are welcome to do that.

394
00:13:57,037 --> 00:13:58,670
      Is it supposed to be eaten
              like a sandwich.

395
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:00,038
I don't think I've ever
 seen anybody do it.

396
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,840
                 All right.
 Well, it's only about 17 pounds

397
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:05,210
                  of food.

398
00:14:05,212 --> 00:14:06,578
                    Yeah.

399
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,745
                   Mm-hmm.

400
00:14:07,747 --> 00:14:09,380
                  Oh, boy.

401
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:11,983
             Yeah, see, I'm not
  a huge breakfast person 'cause

402
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:13,184
    I'm not a big sweets person.

403
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:15,153
             But I do like that
      when you get a little kiss

404
00:14:15,155 --> 00:14:18,423
                of that maple
       with the little saltiness

405
00:14:18,425 --> 00:14:20,625
         of the bacon or the ham
        or whatever it might be.

406
00:14:20,627 --> 00:14:24,662
         And this is that combo,
           which is the contrast

407
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:26,431
              that people love.
         You know what makes it?

408
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:28,566
  Maple mustard butter?
                    Outstanding.

409
00:14:28,568 --> 00:14:30,902
                   That's yours?
          That's mine.

410
00:14:30,904 --> 00:14:32,770
                   Killer.
  the ham goin' with the cheese.

411
00:14:32,772 --> 00:14:33,838
          A little bit of the --
                 the waffle

412
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,273
 playing into the bread element.

413
00:14:35,275 --> 00:14:38,076
 That's pretty much gonna change
       the waistline of Modesto.

414
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:42,547
   It's fantastic.

415
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:46,718
      It's sweet and crispy
and fluffy all at the same time.

416
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,154
        Very unique to the area,
   just a whole lot of goodness.

417
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:52,023
 I'll be back in here tomorrow.

418
00:14:52,025 --> 00:14:53,191
   The waffle should be illegal.

419
00:14:53,193 --> 00:14:54,726
It actually is.
     You should have to weigh in

420
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:57,095
  before you can eat that thing.
               Nice job, guys.

421
00:14:57,097 --> 00:14:58,162
               Thanks very much.
          Thanks, man.

422
00:14:58,164 --> 00:15:00,665
         Appreciate it.
Thank you, sir.

423
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:02,800
         Comin' up, it's
      Stockton, California.

424
00:15:02,802 --> 00:15:04,369
                    Easy greasy.
          Easy greasy.

425
00:15:04,371 --> 00:15:06,938
       An ex-football pro
      slinging the wings...

426
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,173
         Now that's what
       I'm talkin' about.

427
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:10,875
 And scorin' big with the sauce.

428
00:15:10,877 --> 00:15:12,243
               Mm.
   That's my kinda wing sauce.

429
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:21,686
                     ♪

430
00:15:21,688 --> 00:15:23,321
    So I'm here in Stockton,

431
00:15:23,323 --> 00:15:25,256
      California in one of
     the older neighborhoods

432
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:27,425
        known as Yosemite
      to check out a joint.

433
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:31,062
 Get this, it's an ex-NFL player
   and his college sweetheart.

434
00:15:31,064 --> 00:15:33,364
   They decided to jump right
  into the restaurant business.

435
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:35,466
      And from what I hear,
   they're doin' pretty good.

436
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:40,505
This is Smitty's Wings & Things.

437
00:15:40,507 --> 00:15:41,806
              This is the spot.

438
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:43,908
      I need two rib plates
  and a six-pack of hot wings.

439
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,043
              Comin' up, baby.

440
00:15:45,045 --> 00:15:46,644
       MAN: Pizza out here
      is absolutely great.

441
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:48,780
   And they're doin' the wings
     right without a doubt.

442
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:51,249
          Hot and honey barbecue
            comin' up right now.

443
00:15:51,251 --> 00:15:53,518
     I'm a big wing person.
    I crave 'em all the time.

444
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,652
           And this is the place
                 to get 'em?

445
00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:55,787
              Yeah.

446
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:57,121
   And you always
support your mom and pops.

447
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:59,023
   FIERI: Here, mom and pop is
           Jaime Smith

448
00:15:59,025 --> 00:16:00,158
     and her husband, Steve,

449
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,294
    whose career started out
        on the gridiron.

450
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,563
   How long were you in the NFL?
Four years all together.

451
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:07,465
           Played for the, uh...
Jacksonville and Tennessee.

452
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:08,666
     Jacksonville and Tennessee.
Yeah.

453
00:16:08,668 --> 00:16:10,401
I had a couple surgeries,
   back surgeries,

454
00:16:10,403 --> 00:16:12,203
  and that's kinda
why I had to stop playing.

455
00:16:12,205 --> 00:16:13,771
   So it was like,
"I gotta go out and get a job."

456
00:16:13,773 --> 00:16:17,842
      So he traded pigskin
    for a pizza joint in 2013

457
00:16:17,844 --> 00:16:19,544
 and added wings to the roster.

458
00:16:19,546 --> 00:16:21,212
        What makes a great wing,
              in your opinion?

459
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:24,115
Crunchy, moist and big.

460
00:16:24,117 --> 00:16:27,285
 Smitty's home of crunchy, moist
                  and big.

461
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:29,420
   I need a 12-pack Thai sweet
       and sour hot wings.

462
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:32,090
Whatever your appetite is,
whether you like hot,

463
00:16:32,092 --> 00:16:33,658
   you like sweet,
  you like sour...

464
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,194
     They have bleu cheese,
          lemon garlic,

465
00:16:36,196 --> 00:16:37,662
        the garlic chili.

466
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:39,530
 You're the wing-fryin' machine?
Fryin' machine.

467
00:16:39,532 --> 00:16:40,932
                 And you're
       the sauce-makin' machine?

468
00:16:40,934 --> 00:16:42,633
            Yes.
This is gonna go for which wing?

469
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:44,669
       The Damn Hot wing.
       I love spicy food,

470
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:46,671
      but I like spicy food
   that has some flavor in it.

471
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:48,072
      You wanna have some depth?
        Yes.

472
00:16:48,074 --> 00:16:49,140
   So first we're gonna start

473
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:52,076
         some hot sauce,
        garlic, cilantro.

474
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:54,112
      We've got some coarse
          black pepper.

475
00:16:54,114 --> 00:16:56,047
                   Course we do.
    Got some ground cayenne,

476
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:57,081
          fresh lime...

477
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:58,349
         Oh, look at her go now.

478
00:16:58,351 --> 00:16:59,584
      Sorry if I juice ya.

479
00:16:59,586 --> 00:17:02,787
    Chipotle and adobo sauce,
       smoked jalapenos...

480
00:17:02,789 --> 00:17:05,523
                           Okay.
     And some green chilies.

481
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:08,292
             It's gonna be hot.

482
00:17:08,294 --> 00:17:09,460
      You'll be all right.

483
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:12,230
        I don't know about that.

484
00:17:12,232 --> 00:17:13,331
                     Mm.

485
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:14,999
     That's my kinda wing sauce.

486
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:17,035
         There's a lot goin' on.

487
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:18,102
  You pick up a little afterburn

488
00:17:18,104 --> 00:17:19,237
             at the end of that.
              Yes.

489
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:20,838
                    Okay.
   Next one, what are we making?

490
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,573
      Thai sweet and sour.
I eat this one.

491
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:23,808
    You don't eat the other one?

492
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:25,076
I don't do spicy, man.

493
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:26,811
             You don't do spicy?
Nah, man.

494
00:17:26,813 --> 00:17:28,780
             Big shot NFL guys,

495
00:17:28,782 --> 00:17:31,049
           I thought you all did
          spicy, drink gasoline.

496
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:33,184
Oh, nah.
                           Fire.

497
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:34,452
                             No?
Oh, no.

498
00:17:34,454 --> 00:17:35,920
              Sweet chili sauce.
              Yes.

499
00:17:35,922 --> 00:17:38,289
        And then we have
       some rice vinegar.

500
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:39,824
      Then we get 30 shakes
         of fish sauce.

501
00:17:39,826 --> 00:17:42,193
               Thirty shakes?

502
00:17:42,195 --> 00:17:44,495
              That's not really
              a culinary term.

503
00:17:44,497 --> 00:17:47,465
   We have some fresh ginger,
      coarse black pepper,

504
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:50,334
     some granulated garlic
     and some fresh garlic.

505
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:52,370
      And we're gonna whisk
       this all together.

506
00:17:56,609 --> 00:17:57,842
              That's good stuff.
Yeah, yeah.

507
00:17:57,844 --> 00:17:58,876
  That's your sauce right there?

508
00:17:58,878 --> 00:18:00,845
  Where'd that recipe come from?

509
00:18:00,847 --> 00:18:02,480
               Me.
             Play mad scientist?

510
00:18:02,482 --> 00:18:03,948
      Mm-hmm.
       And then try it on Steve?

511
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:06,851
              I wanna be around
             when that happens.

512
00:18:06,853 --> 00:18:08,586
      All right. Let's make some
                wings, Steve.

513
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:11,022
   All right. We'll take some
   regular all-purpose flour.

514
00:18:11,024 --> 00:18:13,024
       I mean, I'm just gonna be
    straight with you right now,

515
00:18:13,026 --> 00:18:14,492
I am not a big breaded wing guy.

516
00:18:14,494 --> 00:18:15,793
     Are you a breaded wing guy?
 Yeah.

517
00:18:15,795 --> 00:18:16,861
        So break it down for me.

518
00:18:16,863 --> 00:18:18,162
I wanna see what's gonna happen.

519
00:18:18,164 --> 00:18:21,232
  Paprika, we got onion powder.

520
00:18:21,234 --> 00:18:23,334
      We got garlic powder.
     Just take it and stir.

521
00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:24,669
                   Easy, greasy.
          Easy, greasy.

522
00:18:24,671 --> 00:18:27,238
            Should we dredge 'em
                 when we go?

523
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,240
              Yeah.
 We just take 'em to the fryer.

524
00:18:29,242 --> 00:18:30,541
            And what temperature
             are we cookin' at?

525
00:18:30,543 --> 00:18:32,143
             Three--
            350, 360,

526
00:18:32,145 --> 00:18:33,277
    when the light comes on,
          I don't know.

527
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:35,847
             Should we to the...
        When the light comes on.

528
00:18:35,849 --> 00:18:39,117
                 Oh, Steve.

529
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:41,319
                 Now, that's
         what I'm talkin' about.

530
00:18:41,321 --> 00:18:43,221
         See, not overly coated.

531
00:18:43,223 --> 00:18:45,323
             I wanna taste wing.
                Look at that.

532
00:18:45,325 --> 00:18:47,458
              Nice and crispy.

533
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,726
                  Oh, yeah.
                 All right.

534
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:50,361
                 We're good.
        I just had to taste 'em.

535
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:51,829
  So we do the Damn Hot first,

536
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:53,831
         just squirt it
       in there like that.

537
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:54,899
          That's coatin' a wing.

538
00:18:54,901 --> 00:18:56,234
             Mm-hmm.

539
00:18:56,236 --> 00:18:58,002
              Boom.

540
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:02,306
    I mean, this is just a good,
               old-fashioned,

541
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:04,909
            funky, crunchy wing.

542
00:19:04,911 --> 00:19:07,145
 Do I have anything right there?
    Unh-uh.

543
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:08,980
  That's how everybody lookin'.
        The Smitty face.

544
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:11,449
                The Smitty face.
It is.

545
00:19:11,451 --> 00:19:14,118
        The sauce is consistent,
              not overly spicy.

546
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,587
             Mouth's not on fire
     but I do have a good, nice,

547
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:17,722
                 round heat.
                Nicely done.

548
00:19:17,724 --> 00:19:18,623
                 All right.
                  Next one.

549
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:19,757
 We got the Thai sweet and sour.

550
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:21,292
                    Okay.

551
00:19:21,294 --> 00:19:22,660
         This is when that wing,

552
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:24,629
             havin' a little bit
            of that flour on it,

553
00:19:24,631 --> 00:19:28,900
    really works the best 'cause
             it's soaking it up.

554
00:19:28,902 --> 00:19:30,768
               It really does.
      That's fried chicken city.

555
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:31,802
                    Nicely done.
            For sure.

556
00:19:31,804 --> 00:19:32,904
Thank you, thank you.
                    Nicely done.

557
00:19:32,906 --> 00:19:34,705
  Table 50, Damn Hot six-pack.

558
00:19:34,707 --> 00:19:35,706
              It's a good kick,

559
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:36,240
          gives you a little bit
                 of sweat..

560
00:19:36,242 --> 00:19:37,975
ey got this nice crunch bite.
              It's a good kick,

561
00:19:37,977 --> 00:19:39,877
        All right, we got
    the Thai sweet and sour.

562
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:41,445
     It's a nice mix of flavors.

563
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:43,748
Get 'em all over your hands,
I mean, they're on your clothes

564
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,916
   and your shoes.

565
00:19:44,918 --> 00:19:46,951
I mean, there's wing sauce
     everywhere.

566
00:19:46,953 --> 00:19:48,553
             FIERI:
 And the ribs will get ya, too.

567
00:19:48,555 --> 00:19:50,521
  Walkin' in with the ribs up.

568
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:51,989
  FIERI: You gonna make me sit
    there and dig into that?

569
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:52,924
        Yeah.
That's how we do it.

570
00:19:52,926 --> 00:19:54,192
         It'll mess my bling up.

571
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:55,793
You gotta get messy.

572
00:19:55,795 --> 00:19:59,597
 We like to see the Smitty face.

573
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:02,333
         Good sauce, good blaze,
          right amount of sugar,

574
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:03,434
           right amount of salt,

575
00:20:03,436 --> 00:20:05,436
               not overcooked,
                  good rib.

576
00:20:05,438 --> 00:20:06,971
           All right.
    I got a rib plate for ya.

577
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:09,340
        The ribs are, uh,
        meaty and tasty.

578
00:20:09,342 --> 00:20:11,742
I can't finish it, I mean...

579
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:14,779
    It's good people, good food,
             just a great place

580
00:20:14,781 --> 00:20:16,781
            to bring your family
                and hang out.

581
00:20:16,783 --> 00:20:19,016
             You know hard work
             from football life.

582
00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:20,084
     Mm-hmm.
       This is a tough business.

583
00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:21,652
             But your enthusiasm

584
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:23,454
             and your optimism,
        you're gettin' after it.

585
00:20:23,456 --> 00:20:25,289
     And I would put those wings
           up against anybody's.

586
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:27,358
     Damn. That's what's up.
                           'Kay?

587
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,826
       I'm gonna tell Emil
       you used his word.

588
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:31,429
       Uh-oh.

589
00:20:31,431 --> 00:20:33,331
   So that's it for this trip,
        but don't worry!

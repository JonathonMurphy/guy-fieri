THE QUESTION COMES TO MIND

30
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:10,536
WHEN DOES SOUTHERN FOOD
  TURN INTO SOUL FOOD.

31
00:01:10,638 --> 00:01:12,805
HERE AT A PLACE CALLED
 SWEETIE PIE'S IN ST. LOUIS,

DEFINITELY THE MACARONI

SEE HOW IT'S FALLING
 OFF THE BONE?

54
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,486
THE FRIED CHICKEN REMINDS ME
   OF MY GRANDMOTHER'S

55
00:02:00,588 --> 00:02:03,489
AND THE CORNBREAD--THE WAY
  SHE USED TO MAKE IT.

56
00:02:03,591 --> 00:02:05,657
IT'S SO GOOD, YOU DON'T
   NEED ANY BUTTER.

NOBODY COOKS LIKE

NOBODY?
       NOBODY.

59
00:02:09,163 --> 00:02:11,430
I GOTTA GO SEE
  ABOUT MY PORK STEAKS.

60
00:02:11,532 --> 00:02:12,898
<i> AND GET THIS.</i>

<i> ROBBIE DIDN'T START OUT</i>

OKAY, BOBBY, I NEED
 MY TURKEY WINGS BACK IN.

63
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:18,337
<i> SHE STARTED OUT AS A SINGER.</i>

64
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:21,306
MET IKE
    AND TINA TURNER...
HOW CRAZY IS THAT?

65
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:23,709
AND FROM THERE, I WENT
  FROM THAT. THAT WAS CRAZY.

66
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:26,712
AND YOU USED
TO COOK ON THE ROAD.
   YEAH, BECAUSE THINGS
    WERE SEGREGATED,

67
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:29,214
AND WE WEREN'T ALLOWED
  IN A LOT OF THE, YOU KNOW,

68
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:30,682
THE BETTER RESTAURANTS.

69
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:34,419
BUT WE HAD ELECTRIC SKILLETS,
 AND WE WOULD COOK IN OUR ROOM.

70
00:02:34,522 --> 00:02:35,854
SO WE GOT ONE, TWO, THREE.

71
00:02:35,956 --> 00:02:37,723
YOU GOT THE NEXT PAN
  OF CHICKEN READY?

72
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:39,391
<i> AND AFTER ALMOST 40 YEARS,</i>

73

<i> SHE LEFT ONE STAGE</i>
 <i> AND JUMPED UP ON ANOTHER.</i>

74
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:43,529
PEACH COBBLER UP.

75
00:02:43,631 --> 00:02:45,931
I PUT DOWN THE MIC
   AND PICKED UP A POT.

76
00:02:46,033 --> 00:02:47,766
ALL OF THESE RECIPES...
...ARE MY MOM'S.

77

EXACTLY.
 'CAUSE I GOTTA BELIEVE THAT
 THERE'S ALWAYS A ROBBIE SPIN.

79
00:02:53,641 --> 00:02:55,474
IT IS, IT IS.
DURING MY TRAVELS,

80
00:02:55,576 --> 00:02:57,709
I PICK UP LITTLE THINGS,
  ADD 'EM,

81
00:02:57,811 --> 00:03:01,480
LITTLE TIT-TATS AND STUFF
AND ADD IT TO MY RECIPE.

82
00:03:01,582 --> 00:03:03,849
<i> LIKE HER MACARONI AND CHEESE.</i>

83
00:03:03,951 --> 00:03:06,451
I'VE BEEN MAKING THIS
    ABOUT 40 YEARS.

84
00:03:06,554 --> 00:03:09,555
RIGHT OUT OF 8th GRADE?
    OUT OF 8th GRADE,
     EXACTLY.

85
00:03:09,657 --> 00:03:11,523
WE'RE GONNA START
    WITH THE PASTA.

86
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:14,626
NOW WE'RE GONNA ADD 2 POUNDS
   OF VELVEETA CHEESE.

87
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:16,428
NOTHING BUT VELVEETA.

88
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,331
NO IMITATIONS,
  DON'T STOP NO PLACE ELSE.

89
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:21,667
DON'T GIVE ME IMITATION
 IMITATION CHEESE?
     THAT'S RIGHT.

90
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:24,770
SO THEN WE GOT
    A POUND OF CHEDDAR.

91
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:26,838
COLBY AND JACK--
   WE GOT A POUND OF THAT.

92
00:03:26,941 --> 00:03:30,409
THEN NEXT WE'RE GONNA
  ADD 2 HEAPING TABLESPOONS

00:11:10,037 --> 00:11:12,504
DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.
       WHOA.

288
00:11:12,606 --> 00:11:15,540
THEY SAY THAT WHEN
  YOU GET HANGOVERS,

289
00:11:15,642 --> 00:11:17,909
THEY EAT MENUDO NEXT DAY.

290
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:19,177
MEXICAN GET-WELL SOUP.

291
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:24,049
BUT REALLY, THIS IS A STAPLE
   IN MEXICAN FOOD?
YES.

292
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:28,153
IN HERE, THE TRIPE.
    I GOTTA BE HONEST,

293
00:11:28,255 --> 00:11:31,156
I'M SCARED
     OF THE TRIPE.

294
00:11:31,258 --> 00:11:33,324
I DON'T THINK I HAVE
  A CONCERN WITH THE HOOF.

295
00:11:33,427 --> 00:11:36,828
I PUT MY FOOT
    IN MY MOUTH A LOT.
OKAY.

296
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:40,598
WE'RE GONNA ADD AN ONION,
GARLIC--THE WHOLE THING--

297
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:44,102
AND THE WATER.

298
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:47,005
GONNA LET IT SIMMER
    FOR HOW LONG?
IT TAKES HOURS.

299
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:49,340
REALLY COOK DOWN
 SO EVERYTHING, EVEN THE BONES,

300
00:11:49,443 --> 00:11:53,511
ALL THAT FLAVOR ALL COMING OUT
 OF THE MARROW OF THE HOOF.
YES.

301
00:11:53,613 --> 00:11:55,046
GUAJILLO PEPPERS.
GUAJILLO PEPPERS.

302
00:11:55,148 --> 00:11:57,916
PUREE THAT, AND THEN THAT'S
  GONNA GO IN THE MENUDO.

303
00:11:58,018 --> 00:12:00,685
NOW DRINK SOME OF IT,
     STRAIN IT?
STRAIN IT.

304
00:12:00,787 --> 00:12:03,121
AND NOW WE PUT
     THE HOMINY IN?
NOW WE PUT THE HOMINY.

305
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:06,324
SO THIS IS BIG
     GIGANTIC CORN?
SALT.

306
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:08,727
THAT'S READY TO GO.

307
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:11,429
WHERE DO YOU START?

308
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:17,202
ONE, TWO, THREE.

309
00:12:17,304 --> 00:12:20,505
GREAT.

310
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:23,174
SOMETIMES
   YOU JUST DON'T KNOW.

311
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:26,244
YOUR EYES ARE BIGGER
   THAN YOUR STOMACH.

312
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:28,179
<i> OKAY, I'M NOT A MENUDO GUY,</i>

313
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:31,116
<i> BUT IF YOU GREW UP LOVING IT,</i>
 <i> THIS JOINT'S THE PLACE TO BE.</i>

314
00:12:31,218 --> 00:12:34,519
IT'S REAL CLOSE TO MY GRANDMA'S,
 TO MY NANA'S AND MY MOM'S.

315
00:12:34,621 --> 00:12:35,887
IT'S REAL CLOSE. VERY GOOD.

316
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:36,988
I LOVE IT.

317
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,990
<i> JUST LIKE THE EL PASTOR.</i>

318
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,126
IN THE WORLD OF EL PASTORS

319
00:12:41,228 --> 00:12:43,027
THIS IS IT.
THAT'S REALLY GOOD.

320
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:44,996
<i> THE CARNE ASADA,</i>
  <i> THE CHIMICHANGA...</i>

321
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:47,398
MMM,
  THAT SHREDDED BEEF, MAN.

322
00:12:47,501 --> 00:12:50,168
<i> REAL-DEAL HOME COOKIN'</i>
  <i> LIKE MAMA USED TO MAKE</i>

323
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:53,471
<i> IF HER KITCHEN</i>
 <i> WAS JUST PAST THE PUMPS.</i>

324
00:12:53,573 --> 00:12:55,507
MEXICAN RESTAURANT
    IN A GAS STATION.

325
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:58,176
NICE JOB.

326
00:12:58,278 --> 00:12:59,577
<i> UP NEXT...</i>

327
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:01,479
IT'S JUST GOOD EATIN'.
 <i> WE'RE HEADIN' FOR KENTUCKY...</i>

328
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:03,848
IT'S GOOD COUNTRY FOOD
 AND A GOOD COUNTRY ATMOSPHERE.

329
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,785
<i> AT ANOTHER JOINT THAT STARTED</i>
  <i> OUT COOKIN' WITH GAS.</i>

330
00:13:06,887 --> 00:13:09,587
THEY NUMBER ONE.
YOU DON'T SAY?
    OH, YES, I DO SAY.

331
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:15,059
SO I'M PULLING OFF INTERSTATE 64
  HERE IN KENTUCKY

332
00:13:15,162 --> 00:13:16,361
TO A TRUCK STOP,

333
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,863
A TRUCK STOP I EXPECT
 TO BE ABLE TO GET SOME FUEL.

334
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:21,199
BUT THEY TOOK THE PUMPS OUT
  A FEW YEARS AGO.

335
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:22,667
SO WHY SO MANY CARS?

336
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:25,537
WELL, WORD IS AROUND HERE
THEY'RE MAKING ALL SORTS OF FOOD

337
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:26,938
LIKE MAMA USED TO MAKE.

338
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,106
TABLE ONE.

339
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:30,008
GRAVY AND BISCUITS.
  IT'S JUST GOOD EATIN'.

340
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,876
ALWAYS THE BEST.
    BRITNEY, YOU'RE UP.

341
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:32,944
HERE'S YOUR
    TENDERLOIN DINNER.

342
00:13:33,046 --> 00:13:34,813
IT DOESN'T STOP,
 DOES IT?
        NO.

343
00:13:34,915 --> 00:13:36,347
DEEP-FRIED CHICKEN BREAST,
   CATFISH.

344
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:37,682
BRING IT.

345
00:13:37,784 --> 00:13:40,585
THEY NUMBER ONE.
YOU DON'T SAY?
    OH, YES, I DO SAY.

346
00:13:40,687 --> 00:13:42,420
A LOT LIKE MOM USED TO MAKE.

347
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:44,222
<i> THAT'S THE WAY</i>
 <i> JUANITA FLANNERY LEARNED</i>

348
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,357
<i> BEFORE SHE OPENED</i>
 <i> THIS PLACE 29 YEARS AGO.</i>

349
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:47,358
EVERYTHING OKAY?

350
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,227
<i>AND JUST LIKE AT OUR LAST STOP,</i>

351
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:52,197
<i>FOLK HERE GOT USED TO FILLIN'</i>
<i>UP WHILE THEY WERE FILLIN' UP.</i>

352
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:54,632
IT'S THE BEST THAT YOU CAN FIND
 AROUND THIS COUNTRY HERE.

353
00:13:54,734 --> 00:13:57,268
<i> TILL JUANITA DECIDED THE GAS</i>
 <i> PUMPS WERE TOO BIG A HASSLE</i>

354
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,736
<i> AND SHUT 'EM DOWN.</i>

355
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:01,339
HAD WE KNOWN THAT IT WOULDN'T
 HAVE AFFECTED THE RESTAURANT,

356
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:03,775
WE WOULD HAVE
    A LONG TIME AGO.
...YOU WOULD HAVE
DONE IT A LONG TIME AGO.

357
00:14:03,877 --> 00:14:06,177
IS IT BUSIER NOW THAN
WHEN IT WAS A TRUCK STOP?
      OH, YEAH.

358
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:08,646
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
    BEEN WORKING HERE?
ALMOST 24 YEARS.

359
00:14:08,748 --> 00:14:10,281
IT'LL BE 14 YEARS IN MAY.

360
00:14:10,383 --> 00:14:12,684
I'VE BEEN COMING HERE, PROBABLY,
 EVER SINCE THEY'VE OPENED.
       REALLY?

361
00:14:12,786 --> 00:14:14,652
JUANITA AND I WENT
  TO SCHOOL TOGETHER.

362
00:14:14,754 --> 00:14:16,187
DEEP-FRIED
     CHICKEN BREAST.

363
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:18,690
HOW DOES THIS STACK UP
TO HOW MOM USED TO MAKE IT?
   IDENTICAL.

364
00:14:18,792 --> 00:14:21,059
<i> AND NOTHING SAYS</i>
  <i> MAMA'S COUNTRY COOKIN'</i>

365
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:22,493
<i> LIKE JUANITA'S SPECIALTY.</i>

366
00:14:22,596 --> 00:14:25,029
BISCUITS AND GRAVY.
     THEY MAKE
    THE BEST IN TOWN.

367
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:26,865
<i> AND SHE'S DOING IT</i>
   <i> FROM A KITCHEN</i>

368
00:14:26,967 --> 00:14:29,267
<i> THAT LOOKS MORE LIKE IT'S</i>
 <i> IN A HOME THAN A RESTAURANT.</i>

369
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:31,135
YOU KEEP THE EGGS
  WHERE I KEEP MINE.

370
00:14:31,238 --> 00:14:33,071
NOW WHERE DID YOU LEARN
   HOW TO MAKE BISCUITS?

371
00:14:33,173 --> 00:14:35,440
WHEN I WAS 12 YEARS OLD,
I WENT TO A BOARDING SCHOOL.

372
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:37,308
WE ALL HAD TO DO A TASK.

373
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,711
AND MINE WAS TO MAKE BISCUITS
  FOR THE WHOLE SCHOOL.

374
00:14:39,813 --> 00:14:41,613
AND MY GRANDMOTHER MADE 'EM
 EVERY, EVERY MORNING.

375
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:44,182
OH, SO YOU'RE
   A BISCUIT QUEEN THEN?
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
 ABOUT THAT.

376
00:14:44,284 --> 00:14:47,285
THIS IS SELF-RISING FLOUR. IT
ALREADY HAS OUR BAKING POWDER.

377
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:49,354
THIS IS SHORTENING.
AND YOU WORK ALL THIS IN.

378
00:14:49,456 --> 00:14:51,623
YOU TRY TO GET THOSE
   GRANULES. HOW MUCH?

379
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:53,591
JUST POUR SLOWLY,
AND I'LL LET YOU KNOW.

380
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:56,327
GOOD POUR IS
 THE PREREQUISITE IN BISCUITS

381
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:58,663
TO GET THE FLOUR
     EVERYWHERE?
YES.

382
00:14:58,765 --> 00:15:01,099
IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT
  TO YOUR NOSE TO YOUR ELBOW,

383
00:15:01,201 --> 00:15:02,800
YOU GOT ISSUES?
EVIDENTLY.

384
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:05,870
OKAY, GRAVY.
    SHORTENING.
   I'M GONNA GET THIS HOT.

385
00:15:05,972 --> 00:15:09,173
AND LET'S
     GET SOME FLOUR.
 WE'RE GONNA START
THICKENING THIS UP.

386
00:15:09,276 --> 00:15:11,276
THIS IS LIKE
A LITTLE ROUX HERE.
       UH-HUH.

387
00:15:11,378 --> 00:15:13,278
IT'S STARTING TO BROWN UP
 A BIT ON THE BOTTOM.

388
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,213
OKAY, TURN IT DOWN
   IF YOU WOULD, PLEASE.

389
00:15:15,315 --> 00:15:18,249
AND I'M A GOOD STIRRER.
  YOU ARE. YOU'RE VERY GOOD.

390
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:21,519
YOU STIR ALMOST
    AS WELL AS YOU EAT.
AS I EAT?

391
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:25,223
OH, NO. I'M A CHAMPION.
 I'M LIKE A PRO-BOWL CHAMPION.

392
00:15:25,325 --> 00:15:27,859
YOU FOLD IN A LITTLE BIT
OF FLOUR SO IT'S MANAGEABLE.

393
00:15:27,961 --> 00:15:29,460
THOSE ARE SOME THICK UN'S.

394
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:32,330
AND YOU SPOON ON A LITTLE
   CLARIFIED BUTTER.
THIS IS SHORTENING.

395
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,332
WHOO, THAT'S A NEW WAY
    FOR BISCUITS.

396
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:36,768
I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT MUCH
 SHORTENING GO ON. I LIKE IT.

397
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,937
HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE
THE BISCUITS TO COOK?

398
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:41,806
ABOUT TEN MINUTES.
SAUSAGE GOES DOWN
 INTO THAT.

399
00:15:41,908 --> 00:15:44,909
IF YOU PUT THE SAUSAGE IN
 RIGHT AWAY, IT GETS TOO HOT.

400
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:47,612
KEEP GOING UNTIL I HOLLER.
    OKAY, STOP.

401
00:15:47,714 --> 00:15:49,647
HOLLER THEN.
       AAH.

402
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:52,383
THAT WASN'T A HOLLER.
 THAT WAS A SQUAWK.

403
00:15:52,485 --> 00:15:55,119
OH, LOOK AT THOSE.
        OW!

404
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:57,722
THEY'RE HOT.
AND LADLE ON? IS THAT
 THE RIGHT RATIO?

405
00:15:57,824 --> 00:16:00,124
I'D GIVE MYSELF A LITTLE
   MORE IF I WERE YOU,

406
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:02,894
UNLESS YOU'RE NOT HUNGRY.
NO, I'M ALWAYS HUNGRY.

407
00:16:02,996 --> 00:16:05,363
MM. THAT WOULD MAKE YOU
   WARM IN THE WINTER.

408
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,699
THE BISCUIT IS SO FLAKY

409
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:10,034
THAT WHEN IT
    GETS IN MY MOUTH,

410
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:11,703
IT ALMOST
    JUST FALLS APART.

411
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:13,171
WELL, YOU KNOW
     IT'S GOOD GRAVY

412
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:15,106
WHEN THE FIRST BITE
    THAT YOU GET

413
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:17,141
HAS A BIG OLD PIECE
    OF SAUSAGE IN IT,

414
00:16:17,243 --> 00:16:20,511
AND IT'S NOT JUST TEASING YOU
 WITH SAUSAGE FLAVOR INSIDE.

415
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:22,714
MM.
IT'S HOT, ISN'T IT?

416
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:24,682
THAT'S GOOD GRAVY, GIRL.
  JUST LIKE MAMA WOULD MAKE.

417
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:27,118
HARD TO BEAT.
     I'D EAT 'EM
    THREE TIMES A DAY.

418
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,386
<i> 'CAUSE AFTER BREAKFAST,</i>

419
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,788
<i> YOU CAN GET 'EM</i>
<i>WITH ANYTHING ELSE ON THE MENU.</i>

420
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,458
IT'S GOOD COUNTRY FOOD
 AND A GOOD COUNTRY ATMOSPHERE.

421
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,827
<i> WHICH MAKES THIS</i>
 <i> EVERYBODY'S GO-TO KITCHEN.</i>

422

WE'RE DOWN TO 90 TICKETS.

423
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:39,297
RIGHT BEHIND.
    THANK YOU, SWEETIE.

424
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:41,332
THIS IS LIKE
A CULINARY BALLET.

425
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:42,600
I'M IN THE WAY.

426
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:44,702

      YES.
      OH, YEAH.

<i>CRANKIN' OUT COUNTRY CLASSIC...</i>

     I'M GONNA TRY.

434
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:02,653
HOMEMADE HAMBURGER WITH ITALIAN
 SEASONINGS IN THE BURGER--

435
00:17:02,756 --> 00:17:03,855
IT'S VERY GOOD.

436
00:17:03,957 --> 00:17:05,757
<i> AND IF YOU'RE GOING</i>
  <i> FOR A HOT DOG...</i>

437
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,892
TO EXPECT IT TO COME
   WITH MEAT SAUCE ON TOP.

438
00:17:07,994 --> 00:17:10,328
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY WE EAT
  HOT DOGS AROUND HERE.

439
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,230
IT'S A LEAN BURGER.
85/15?

440
00:17:12,332 --> 00:17:14,766
MM-HMM. I WILL
    PUT SOME ONIONS IN.

441
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:17,802
NOW WHERE YOU'D LEARN
HOW TO MAKE THIS ONE?
    JUST IN MY HEAD.

442
00:17:17,904 --> 00:17:19,737
NOW WHAT STARTS GOING IN?
      SOME SALT.

443
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,606
A LITTLE TICKLE.
     SOME GARLIC.

444
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,307
THAT'S CHILI POWDER.
       UH-HUH.

445
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:25,777
THIS IS SOME KETCHUP
    AND TOMATO SAUCE.

446
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:28,212
IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOT
 SOME SPICE IN THERE.
     YEAH, IT DOES.

447
00:17:28,314 --> 00:17:30,481
A LITTLE BROWN SUGAR.
OH, A LITTLE MUSTARD.

448
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,417
I'M GONNA LIKE
SOME OF THAT BITE.
       MM-HMM.

449
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:33,851
MM, THAT SMELLS GOOD.
       YEAH.

450
00:17:33,953 --> 00:17:36,154
OH, WE DO NEED ONION.

451
00:17:36,256 --> 00:17:39,123
THAT IS GOOD SAUCE. A SIMPLE
 SAUCE, BUT GOOD SAUCE.

452
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:42,026
YOU GET TOMATO FLAVOR,

453
00:17:42,128 --> 00:17:43,928
GET A LITTLE BIT
 OF THE SPICE.

454
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,830
I COULD HAVE
3 OR 12 OF THOSE.

455

<i> AND SOME OF JUANITA'S</i>

464
00:18:10,457 --> 00:18:11,789
LIKE HOME COOKING.
...COOKING.

465
00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:12,790
ESPECIALLY THE PIE.

VERY FEW REAL RECIPES
 AROUND HERE.

468
00:18:17,197 --> 00:18:19,530
THIS IS GREAT FOR ME, 'CAUSE
 I CAN'T BAKE TO SAVE MY LIFE,

469
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:21,933
AND NOW WE'RE NOT EVEN
  GONNA HAVE A REAL RECIPE.

470
00:18:22,035 --> 00:18:24,735
BEAUTIFUL.
 AND WE NEED A LITTLE BIT
OF SALT AND A LITTLE MORE.

471
00:18:24,838 --> 00:18:26,270
AND THIS IS YOUR
 SHORTENING.

472
00:18:26,372 --> 00:18:28,806
WOULD YOU LIKE TO BEAT THOSE UP
 FOR ME WHILE WE DO THIS,

473
00:18:28,908 --> 00:18:31,375
OR WOULD YOU
LIKE ME TO DO IT?
      DUMB EGG!

474
00:18:31,478 --> 00:18:34,579
HOW OFTEN DO YOU
     MAKE THE PIES?
TWO OR THREE TIMES A DAY.

475
00:18:34,681 --> 00:18:38,816
A DAY?
UH-HUH. ALWAYS ROLL
FROM THE CENTER OUT.

476
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:41,886
FOLD IT OVER.
  LOOK AT THAT. WHAT A PRO.

477
00:18:41,988 --> 00:18:44,789
LOOK HOW NICE
     IT TURNED OUT.
OKAY, THEN WE'RE
 GONNA DO THIS.

478
00:18:44,891 --> 00:18:46,657
POKING A LITTLE BIT
    OF HOLES IN IT--

479
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:48,526
LET'S IT BREATHE
    SOME OF THE STEAM

480
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,461
SO IT DOESN'T BUBBLE UP.
EXACTLY.

481
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:52,864
AND THAT'LL GO DOWN
     FOR WHAT?
15 TO 20.

482
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:54,832
WE'RE GONNA MAKE
    THE COCONUT CREAM?
YEAH.

483
00:18:54,934 --> 00:18:56,834
CORN STARCH.
AND A LITTLE BIT OF MILK.

484
00:18:56,936 --> 00:18:59,637
AGAIN, THOSE
  MEASUREMENT RATIOS I LOVE.

485
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:01,739
AND WE'RE GONNA
CUT SOME SUGAR IN IT.

486
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:04,175
THEN WE'RE GONNA PUT OUR YOLKS
IN HERE AND MIX THAT TOGETHER.

487
00:19:04,277 --> 00:19:06,177
WE'RE GOING TO STRAIN THIS
 MIXTURE INTO OUR MILK,

488
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:08,613
BECAUSE THERE COULD
BE SOME EGG WHITE IN HERE

489
00:19:08,715 --> 00:19:11,549
THAT WOULD CAUSE
SOMETHING FUNNY.
   SO YOU'RE JUST GONNA
   CONTINUE TO STIR THAT

490
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,017
UNTIL IT THICKENS.

491
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:15,453
YOU GOT CORN STARCH IN THERE, SO
 THAT MIXTURE STARTS TO HEAT UP,

492
00:19:15,555 --> 00:19:17,855
THAT'LL REALLY
    START TO TIGHTEN.
LET'S GET OUR PIECRUST.

493
00:19:17,957 --> 00:19:20,391
THAT LOOKS GOOD.
 WE'RE GOING
TO PUT SOME BUTTER.

494
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:24,362
AND A LITTLE BIT
    OF VANILLA EXTRACT?
THAT'S MY SECRET.

495
00:19:24,464 --> 00:19:27,665
THAT'S VODKA!

496
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:31,335
YOU SEE WHY THEY
LIKE 'EM SO WELL.
     WHOO! THEY ALL
    KEEP COMING BACK.

497
00:19:31,437 --> 00:19:34,138
A LITTLE BIT OF COCONUT.

498
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,706
WANT TO LICK THE SPOON?

499
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:39,443
THAT IS HEAVY.
WE SHOULD MAKE SOME
 MERINGUE FOR IT.

500
00:19:39,546 --> 00:19:42,380
GET ANGRY WITH IT.
OH, I DO.

501
00:19:42,482 --> 00:19:46,617
AND NOW A LITTLE BIT
     OF SUGAR?

502
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:47,985
BRING IT.

503
00:19:48,087 --> 00:19:50,421
LOOK OUT.
    ROBBIE, THAT IS--

504
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:53,658
THE MAGIC YOU DO
    WITH JUST A SPOON--

505
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,026
A LITTLE COCONUT.

506
00:19:55,128 --> 00:19:57,428
AND THAT'LL CRISP UP BROWN
  WHEN WE PUT IT IN THE OVEN.

507
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:58,963
WOW, IT'S CHRISTMAS
    IN FLAVOR TOWN.

508
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:00,331
LOOK AT THAT THING.

509
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:03,467
I DON'T KNOW THAT I HAVE EVER
  JUMPED INTO AN ADVENTURE

510
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:06,704
OF THAT MUCH OF THAT.

511
00:20:06,806 --> 00:20:10,041
WOW. GOOD MERINGUE.

512
00:20:10,143 --> 00:20:11,642
YOU'RE PRETTY EXCEPTIONAL.

513
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:15,079
MY FAVORITE PART IS THE CRUNCHY
  COOKED COCONUT ON TOP.
MMM, YEAH.

514
00:20:15,181 --> 00:20:17,014
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

A LOT OF HAPPY FOLKS.
I MEAN, THE PLACE IS PACKED.

524
00:20:35,702 --> 00:20:40,271
YOU GAVE ME TOO MUCH.
OH, WELL, THAT'S BETTER
THAN NOT ENOUGH, RIGHT?

525
00:20:40,373 --> 00:20:42,506
WELL, THAT'S IT FOR THIS TRIP,
  BUT DON'T WORRY.

526
00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:43,941
I'LL BE LOOKING FOR YA

527

AT AMERICA'S GREATEST DINERS,
  DRIVE-INS AND DIVES.

528
00:20:47,113 --> 00:20:50,615
LOOK AT THAT PARTY RIGHT THERE.

529
00:20:50,717 --> 00:20:53,384
BUT I DON'T EVEN THINK
  A GREAT COLD MEXICAN BEER

530
00:20:53,486 --> 00:20:55,987
AND A MARIACHI BAND WOULD
  HAVE MADE THAT GO DOWN.

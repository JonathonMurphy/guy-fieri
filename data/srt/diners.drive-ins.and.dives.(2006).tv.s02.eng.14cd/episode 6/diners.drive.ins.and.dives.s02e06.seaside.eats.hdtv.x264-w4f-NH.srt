BUT THAT'S EXACTLY
  WHAT YOU'RE GONNA GET--

30
00:01:03,798 --> 00:01:04,797
A MOUTHFUL--AT THIS JOINT--

31
00:01:04,899 --> 00:01:06,331
EVELYN'S DRIVE-IN,

32
00:01:06,434 --> 00:01:08,500
WHERE THEY FEATURE
  FRESH LOCAL SEAFOOD,

33
00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:09,668
EITHER FRIED OR GRILLED,

34
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:11,804
AND SOME GREAT LOCAL FAVORITES.

35
00:01:11,906 --> 00:01:13,672
CAN I GET FOUR CLAM CAKES?

36
00:01:16,043 --> 00:01:18,043
IT'S FRESH.

37
00:01:18,145 --> 00:01:19,378
THAT'S FANTASTIC.

38
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,846
I LOVE THIS PLACE

39
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:23,082
BECAUSE THEY SERVE TRADITIONAL
  NEW ENGLAND SEAFOOD.

40
00:01:23,184 --> 00:01:24,249
<i> ...LIKE CLAM CAKES.</i>

41

     SO HAPPY ABOUT?

42
00:01:26,287 --> 00:01:29,688
JUST LOVIN' LIFE

<i> AND FRESH, LOCAL</i>
 <i> WHOLE BELLY FRIED CLAMS...</i>

44
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:35,027
THE BEST--THE MEAT
  IN THAT IS BIG BELLY.

45
00:01:35,129 --> 00:01:36,128
<i> AND CHOWDER.</i>

46
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:38,130
THIS IS HOW I WOULD
  MAKE MY CHOWDER--

47
00:01:38,232 --> 00:01:39,832
EVERYTHING RIGHT FROM THE OCEAN.

48
00:01:39,934 --> 00:01:41,834
YOU WANT TO MAKE
  A SEAFOOD PLATTER?

49
00:01:41,936 --> 00:01:44,736
<i> JANE AND DOMENIC BITTO</i>
 <i> BOUGHT EVELYN'S 21 YEARS AGO.</i>

50
00:01:44,839 --> 00:01:48,040
WE JUST KIND OF TRIPPED AND FELL
  UPON EVELYN'S DRIVE-IN.

51
00:01:48,142 --> 00:01:51,710
I ACTUALLY GOT LOST
 GOING TO ANOTHER PLACE.
AND YOU WERE
 LOOKING TO BUY?

52
00:01:51,812 --> 00:01:54,146
YEAH. SO THEN WE STOPPED
   HERE FOR LUNCH,

53
00:01:54,248 --> 00:01:56,215
AND THAT'S HOW--
  AND IT WAS FOR SALE

54
00:01:56,317 --> 00:01:57,716
FROM THE ORIGINAL
    EVELYN.

55
00:01:57,818 --> 00:02:00,519
<i> AND THEY'VE BEEN DOING THINGS</i>
 <i> EVELYN'S WAY EVER SINCE.</i>

56
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:02,154
NUMBER 720, YOUR FOOD IS READY.

57
00:02:02,256 --> 00:02:06,291
IN THE WORLD OF SEAFOOD,
  HOW DO THESE FOLKS RATE?
TOP SHELF.

58
00:02:06,393 --> 00:02:07,659
I'M HERE EVERY WEEK,

59
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:09,561
BUT I USUALLY
EAT THE FRIED CLAMS.

60
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:11,497
FRIED CLAMS IS WHAT
 WE'RE FAMOUS FOR.

61
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,965
<i> ...STILL DONE EVELYN'S WAY.</i>

62
00:02:13,067 --> 00:02:14,233
IT'S A DRY BATTER.

63
00:02:14,335 --> 00:02:15,834
<i> NO DIPPING IN MILK</i>

64
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,970
<i> AND JUST ENOUGH BATTER</i>
  <i> TO GET THE JOB DONE.</i>

65
00:02:18,072 --> 00:02:20,139
WE TRY TO GET MOST
  OF THE BATTER OFF,

66
00:02:20,241 --> 00:02:22,541
WHICH A LOT OF PLACES
  WON'T COOK IT THAT WAY.

67
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:24,977
AND WE FRY IT SO IT COMES OUT
  WITH A NICE THIN CRUST

68
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:26,445
INSTEAD OF, LIKE,
  THAT THICK CRUST

69
00:02:26,547 --> 00:02:27,880
THAT YOU'RE NORMALLY USED TO.

70
00:02:27,982 --> 00:02:29,848
SO WHAT YOU'RE GETTING
   IS ALL SEAFOOD.

71
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,351
THAT'S LIKE A MONSTER
    CLAM PLATE.
I'M GONNA EAT
 IT ALL.

72
00:02:32,453 --> 00:02:34,853
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO
 THIS ALL SUMMER. I REALLY HAVE.

73
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:36,855
I HAVEN'T HAD A FRIED CLAM YET,

74
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:39,091
AND THIS IS, LIKE, THE MOST
 IMPORTANT PART OF SUMMER.

75
00:02:39,193 --> 00:02:43,328
HOW ABOUT CHOWDER?
 OH, YEAH, CHOWDER'S PROBABLY
 ONE OF OUR HUGEST ITEMS HERE.

76
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,864
IT'S A RHODE ISLAND
     CHOWDER.
WHAT'S RHODE ISLAND
  CHOWDER?

77
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:47,633
IT'S CALLED
    A CLEAR CHOWDER,

78
00:02:47,735 --> 00:02:50,102
SO THERE'S NO CREAM
     ADDED TO IT

79
00:02:50,204 --> 00:02:52,571
TILL THE WAITRESS
    IS SERVING IT,

80
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:54,072
AND THEN THE CREAM
     IS ADDED.

81
00:02:54,175 --> 00:02:56,041
THIS IS ACTUALLY EVELYN'S
   ORIGINAL RECIPE.

82
00:02:56,143 --> 00:02:58,744
THAT'S EVELYN'S
 ORIGINAL POT.
       IT IS.

83
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:02,981
AND WE JUST
     ADD MARGARINE.
AND NOW WE THROW IN
 SOME CLAM BASE?

84
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:05,751
YEP. AND THIS IS HOW EVELYN'S
  PUTS THEIR BAY LEAVES

85
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:07,019
IN THE CHOWDER,

86
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:11,790
'CAUSE WE DON'T WANT ANYBODY
  TO CHOKE ON A BAY LEAF.

87
00:03:11,892 --> 00:03:14,893
SO THAT GOES IN THERE. A LITTLE
 BIT OF ONION, NOT TOO MUCH.

88
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:19,097
THEN YOU ADD YOUR
    2 GALLONS OF CLAMS.
HOLY CLAM, BATMAN.

89
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,366
ARE YOU SERIOUS?
SO RAW POTATOES--

90
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:22,668
RUSSETS
THAT ARE PEELED.

91
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,670
SO THIS'LL TAKE ABOUT
ANOTHER HALF AN HOUR

92
00:03:24,772 --> 00:03:27,039
TO COME UP?
     HALF AN HOUR,
    40 MINUTES, YEP.

93
00:03:27,141 --> 00:03:30,142
IT'S SO GOOD. IT TASTES
 A LOT LIKE THE CREAMY KIND,

94
00:03:30,244 --> 00:03:32,945
BUT IT'S, UM, IT'S LIGHTER.

95
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:35,447
<i> BUT THIS RHODE ISLAND</i>
 <i> BROTH CHOWDER EXPERIENCE</i>

96
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:37,449
<i> WOULDN'T BE COMPLETE</i>
 <i> WITHOUT A LITTLE NUGGET</i>

97
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:38,951
<i> CALLED A CLAM CAKE.</i>

98
00:03:39,053 --> 00:03:40,619
WHEN YOU
    START EATING THEM

99
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:43,055
AND THEN YOU COME BACK
  AND YOU HAVE ANOTHER ONE,

100
00:03:43,157 --> 00:03:45,490
YOU DIP IT IN YOUR CHOWDER,
 THEN YOU GET ADDICTED TO IT.

101
00:03:45,593 --> 00:03:47,559
IS THERE A SUPPORT GROUP,
  A NUMBER I CAN CALL?

102
00:03:47,661 --> 00:03:50,095
SO WE JUST MIX IT UP.
WE USE A LITTLE WARM WATER.

103
00:03:50,197 --> 00:03:52,598
DO YOU MEASURE IT,
  OR DO YOU JUST EYEBALL IT?

104
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,099
YEAH, WE DO EVERYTHING
 BY CONSISTENCY.

105
00:03:54,201 --> 00:03:57,269
NOW THIS LOOKS LIKE A FULL-TIME
  JOB HERE AT EVELYN'S.

106
00:03:57,371 --> 00:04:00,906
MAKING 20 OR 25 BUCKETS A DAY
 IS PRETTY FULL TIME, YEAH.

107
00:04:01,008 --> 00:04:03,909
SO YOU JUST SIT HERE
  THE WHOLE TIME AND DO THIS?
YEAH.

108
00:04:04,011 --> 00:04:05,444
AND THEN THEY YELL.
YEAH.

109
00:04:05,546 --> 00:04:06,678
CAN I GET FOUR?

110
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,147
I HAVE TO BAG FOUR
AND GO GIVE IT TO THEM.

111
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,649
YOU COULD EAT 'EM PLAIN...

112
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,551
TAKE A BITE
OF THE CLAM.

113
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:14,486
ARE YOU GONNA
    PUT IT IN THERE?

114
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:17,055
YOU'RE TEASING ME WITH IT.
   I FEEL LIKE A DOG.

115
00:04:17,157 --> 00:04:19,725
OH, THAT'S GONNA BE
    HOW IT'S GONNA BE.

116
00:04:19,827 --> 00:04:21,026
SALTY DOUGHNUT.

117
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:22,494
<i> OR WITH VINEGAR.</i>

118
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:24,896
IT MOISTENS IT UP A LITTLE BIT
 AND MAKES IT REALLY TART.

119
00:04:24,999 --> 00:04:26,832
<i> BUT THE REAL DEAL</i>
  <i> IS WITH CHOWDER.</i>

120
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:28,166
THAT'S A CROUTON, BABY.

121
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:30,068
- THAT'S A CROUTON.
- EXACTLY.

122
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:32,004
AND I'VE NEVER
  HAD IT THIS THIN,

123
00:04:32,106 --> 00:04:34,006
BUT I GOTTA TELL YA,
 THIS IS ALMOST DELICATE.

124
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:36,842
AND THE CLAMS
  ARE TENDER. WOW.

125
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:39,378
SO THIS IS WHAT
  IT'S ALL ABOUT, HUH?

126
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,179
THIS IS KILLER.

127
00:04:41,282 --> 00:04:42,281
HI.
        HI.

128

<i> SO IS THE WHOLE</i>

00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:31,029
NOW WE SLOWLY
STIR THAT IN.
     AND WE HAVE
     THE LOBSTER.

147
00:05:34,368 --> 00:05:37,069
LOOK AT THAT.
    THAT'S THE LOBSTER
     CHOW MEIN.

148
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:41,940
THIS, MY FRIEND,
IS GONNA GO UP THERE

149
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:44,276
IN SOME OF THE ODDEST THINGS
  I'VE EVER EATEN.

150
00:05:44,378 --> 00:05:47,279
DUDE, THIS IS FUNKY,
  BUT GOOD.

151
00:05:47,381 --> 00:05:49,514
THIS IS THE END
OF THE SPECTRUM, MAYBE.

152
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:51,450
IT'S ADDICTING.
       GOOD.

153
00:05:51,552 --> 00:05:53,418
YOU DON'T JUST
WANT ONE BITE.

154
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,720
YOUR MIND,
YOUR BODY--

155
00:05:54,822 --> 00:05:56,855
MY MOUTH'S GOING, LIKE,
"WHAT ARE YOU HAVING?"

156
00:05:56,957 --> 00:05:59,891
THERE'S NO REASON THAT
I SHOULD BE ENJOYING IT.
    OH, I KNOW. I KNOW.

157
00:05:59,993 --> 00:06:02,761
BUT AS WRONG AS IT IS,
  IT'S RIGHT.

158
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:04,763
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
  IT'S EXCELLENT.

159
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:07,099
IT IS DELICIOUS.
    IT IS, ISN'T IT?

160
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:09,935

167
00:06:22,616 --> 00:06:24,583
WELL, WE OFTEN SIT THERE
  IN THE MORNING FOR COFFEE

168
00:06:24,685 --> 00:06:26,918
AND TALK ABOUT STUFF
    INSTEAD OF INSIDE.
WE LOVE IT.

169
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:30,322
YOU REALLY LOOK
   STRESSED OUT.
WE DO?

170
00:06:30,424 --> 00:06:32,424
YEAH, RIGHT.

171
00:06:32,526 --> 00:06:35,127
<i> NEXT UP, WE'RE HEADING</i>
 <i> TO A BEACH NEAR SAN DIEGO,</i>

172

<i> WHERE A SURFER'S</i>
  <i> BANGING OUT BURGERS...</i>

173
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:37,896
IT'S MESSY, AND IT'S DELICIOUS.

174

<i> YOU CAN'T HELP BUT WEAR.</i>

175
00:06:39,767 --> 00:06:41,733
DON'T LET THAT BURGER
 INTIMIDATE YOU.
     WELL, IT'S NOT
     INTIMIDATING.

176
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:43,735
I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
   AM I WORRIED

177
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:46,338
ABOUT THE REST OF MY WARDROBE
  FOR THE REST OF THE DAY?

178
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,277
OCEAN BEACH, CALIFORNIA,
  IS HOME TO GREAT SURF,

179
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:54,379
A LOT OF REALLY COOL
  LAID-BACK PEOPLE

180
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:56,047
AND A LITTLE PLACE
   CALLED HODAD'S,

181
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:58,717
IN MY OPINION, WHAT A LOCAL
 BURGER JOINT OUGHTA BE--

182
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:02,053
NO SHOES, NO SHIRT, NO PROBLEM.

183
00:07:04,324 --> 00:07:05,457
RIGHT HERE, BUDDY.

184
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:07,125
WHERE TO, JAMIE?

185
00:07:07,227 --> 00:07:08,226
IT'S DELICIOUS.

186
00:07:08,328 --> 00:07:09,661
NOW THIS
   IS A FANCY RESTAURANT.

187
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,663
LADIES ALWAYS GO FIRST
   IN A FANCY RESTAURANT.

188
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:12,831
THEY'RE VERY FRIENDLY.

189
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:14,900
WHAT DOES HODAD
 MEAN ANYWAYS?
      HODAD--

190
00:07:15,002 --> 00:07:16,902
OKAY, IT'S A SURFING TERM
   FROM THE EARLY '60s.

191
00:07:17,004 --> 00:07:19,337
IT'S SOMEONE THAT HANGS OUT ON
THE BEACH, HAS GOT A NICE BOARD.

192
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,406
YOU ALWAYS SEE 'EM,
YOU KNOW, AT THE BEACH,

193
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:23,308
BUT THEY DON'T KNOW
 HOW TO SURF.

194
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,810
<i> WHEN MIKE HARDIN</i>

<i> AND GAVE THE PLACE</i>
 <i> HIS OWN SENSE OF STYLE.</i>

200

     IN THIS AREA?
BEST BURGER,

208
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:53,371
- NO FANCY FRILLS...
- 'KAY.

209
00:07:53,474 --> 00:07:56,441

  JUST OLD-FASHIONED SLOPPY
 RUN-DOWN-YOUR-ARM HAMBURGERS.

210

DO IT RIGHT.

211
00:07:57,644 --> 00:08:00,445
NOW IS THAT THE NORMAL
 SIZE OF THE BURGER?

212
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:02,447
ACTUALLY, THE DOUBLE'S A LITTLE
  BIT BIGGER THAN THAT.

213
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:05,283
THE DOUBLE'S
BIGGER THAN THIS?
    YEAH, AND THAT'S
     A DOUBLE.

214
00:08:05,385 --> 00:08:06,751
IT'S MESSY, AND IT'S DELICIOUS.

215
00:08:06,854 --> 00:08:10,422
WHAT SHOULD I
  TRY TODAY?
    THE BACON
    CHEESEBURGER.

216
00:08:10,524 --> 00:08:11,957
THE BACON
 CHEESEBURGER?

217
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:14,793
<i> EACH BURGER STARTS WITH FRESH</i>
 <i> GROUND BEEF--NEVER FROZEN.</i>

218

    A BIG DIFFERENCE.
YES.

YES, PLEASE.

AHH, ANYWHERE.

ANYWHERE.
      ANYWHERE?

222

ANYWHERE. NOT THERE,
 BUT ANYWHERE ELSE.

223

HERE'S WHAT I QUESTION.
 THAT'S THE BUN.

224
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:31,243
THE BURGER IS BIGGER
 THAN THE BUN.

 <i> OF THESE INTO A BACON BURGER.</i>

229

IT'S BACON. IT'S BACON.
  IT'S BACON.

230
00:08:43,257 --> 00:08:45,757
IT'S LIKE BACON SOUP.
I WANT THE BURGERS
 TO BE BIG.

231
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:48,527
I WANT THE BACON--I DON'T LIKE
 TWO LITTLE STRIPS OF BACON.

232
00:08:48,629 --> 00:08:52,163
LIKE THE REST OF THE WORLD
  MAKES BACON CHEESEBURGERS?
EXACTLY.

233
00:08:52,266 --> 00:08:54,699
YOU DON'T WANT
    TO FOLLOW THAT?
 WE WANT TO MAKE
LIKE A BACON PATTY.

234
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:58,136
THAT'S WHAT
THIS DOES.
     SO YOU BOIL
   THE BACON IN WATER?

235
00:08:58,238 --> 00:09:00,305
YEP.
   THEN THIS SITS HERE
    AND STRAINS OUT?

236
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:02,908
YEP. PUT IT ON THE GRILL,
  FLATTEN IT OUT,

237
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:05,076
TURN IT OVER.

238

THERE YOU GO.
 HOW DO YOU
WANT TO DO IT?

240
00:09:10,751 --> 00:09:13,151
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,
 WAIT. DID I PUT TOO MUCH,

241
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:15,654
'CAUSE THAT'S AS BIG
 AS THE BURGER?
   NO, THAT'S PERFECT.

242
00:09:15,756 --> 00:09:18,156
THAT'S HOW IT GOES?
     YEAH, IT WAS
     A LITTLE LESS,

243
00:09:18,258 --> 00:09:20,158
BUT THAT'S FINE.
THAT'S A LITTLE LESS?

244
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,160
THAT'S A LITTLE LESS,
   BUT THAT'S ALL RIGHT?

245
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:24,162
TWO SLICES?
     TWO SLICES
    OF CHEESE ON TOP.

246
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:25,664
NOW A TYPICAL BURGER
  GETS WHAT?

247
00:09:25,766 --> 00:09:28,400
LETTUCE, TOMATOES, ONIONS,
 PICKLES, MAYONNAISE,

248
00:09:28,502 --> 00:09:29,868
MUSTARD AND KETCHUP,

     OR GO HOME.

250

MAYONNAISE IS GOOD
FOR YOU. THAT'S RIGHT.

A LITTLE BIT SHARPER TASTE,

252
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:39,778
SO YOU DON'T
USE AS MUCH.
     WAIT A SECOND,

253
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,680
ARE YOU DOING
   A FOOD SHOW RIGHT NOW?

254
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:43,982
NOW THE ONIONS,
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO--

255
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,784
YOU'RE BUILDING
A FOUNDATION HERE.

256
00:09:45,886 --> 00:09:48,520
TURN IT OVER. YOU'RE BUILDING
  YOURSELF A LITTLE--

257
00:09:48,622 --> 00:09:51,089
A LITTLE ONION CASTLE,
 IF YOU WILL...

258
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:52,557
IF YOU WILL.
     ONION CASTLE?

259
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:54,059
ONION CASTLE.
      GOT IT.

260
00:09:54,161 --> 00:09:56,461
YOU GOTTA PUT THE KETCHUP
 ON TOP OF THE ONIONS.

261
00:09:56,563 --> 00:09:58,863
IT KIND OF NEUTRALIZES IT
  A LITTLE BIT.
     LIKE A SCARY
    ROLLER COASTER.

262
00:09:58,966 --> 00:10:00,131
YEAH, ISN'T THAT
 SOMETHING?

263
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:02,634
PICKLES JUST ADD TO IT,
 A COUPLE SLICES OF TOMATOES.

264
00:10:02,736 --> 00:10:07,205
NOW WE DO THE LETTUCE, AND WE
 CALL THIS THE LETTUCE SNOWBALL.

265
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:10,108
BADA-BING. NOW YOU
PUT THAT ON THERE.

266
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,043
AND THEN THIS?
SLIDE IT ON THERE.

267
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:18,016
LOOK AT THAT.
LOOK AT THAT.
  OKAY, I GOTTA JUST HAVE
 MY PICTURE TAKEN WITH THIS.

268
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,218
NOW WHAT'S IT
     WRAPPED IN?
THE BURGER DIAPER.

269
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,621
AND ONCE YOU PICK IT UP,
DON'T LET IT GO, YOU KNOW?

270
00:10:22,723 --> 00:10:26,224
YOU GOTTA
    CODDLE THE BABY.
WE GIVE LESSONS ON WEDNESDAYS
  ON HOW TO EAT.

271
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:29,394
WE HAVE GRADUATES WHO WILL
 BE DOWN TO, LIKE, TWO NAPKINS.

272

IS SHE DOING
  THIS RIGHT, MIKEY?
YEAH, SHE'S
DOING GREAT.

273
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,233
DOES SHE HAVE
   THE HAND--
   THIS ONE'S
 NOT DOING IT RIGHT.

274
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:37,802
HAVE YOU NOT BEEN
 TO THE WEDNESDAY LESSON?

275
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:40,005
DID YOU EAT THE WHOLE THING?
       UH, YEAH.

276
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:42,674
THIS IS WHAT'S
     LEFT OF IT.
THE DIAPER.

277
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:44,943
ALL RIGHT, NOW THIS
IS VERY IMPORTANT,

278
00:10:45,045 --> 00:10:47,012
VERY, VERY IMPORTANT.

279
00:10:47,114 --> 00:10:49,681
A LITTLE
NIP AND TUCK.

280
00:10:49,783 --> 00:10:52,751
LOOK AT THAT. SEE, YOU CAN SEE
JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING ON THERE.

281
00:10:52,853 --> 00:10:54,185
THAT'S WHAT
YOU WANT TO DO.

282
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:56,187
YOU WANT TO BE ABLE
TO SEE EVERYTHING,

283
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:58,323
BECAUSE, AS YOU KNOW,
90% OF YOUR TASTE BUDS

284
00:10:58,425 --> 00:11:00,859
ARE IN YOUR EYEBALLS.
       DUDE.

285
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:03,962
AND THAT'S WHAT
THE CUSTOMERS GET.
  I NEED, LIKE, A ROAD MAP
  TO EAT THROUGH THIS THING.

286
00:11:04,064 --> 00:11:06,765
DON'T LET THAT BURGER
 INTIMIDATE YOU.
     WELL, IT'S NOT
     INTIMIDATING.

287
00:11:06,867 --> 00:11:08,233
I'M JUST TRYING
     TO FIGURE OUT

288
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:10,201
AM I WORRIED ABOUT
   THE REST OF MY WARDROBE

289
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:12,704
FOR THE REST
     OF THE DAY?
LEAN OVER. LEAN OVER.

290
00:11:12,806 --> 00:11:15,874
TROUGH IT. TROUGH IT.

291
00:11:15,976 --> 00:11:18,376
OH, HE'S A NATURAL. HE'S BEEN
 EATING HIS WHOLE LIFE.

292
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:20,378
I CAN TELL
BY LOOKING AT HIM.

293
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,715
LOOK IT.
YOU WEAR IT WELL.
     THAT'S OUT
    OF BOUNDS, MAN.

294
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:27,352
THAT'S SOMETHING.
   JUST FOR THE SHOW,
 I'M GONNA TAKE ANOTHER BITE.

295
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:30,388
NORMALLY, I'M
   A VERY PETITE EATER.

296
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:31,890
<i> AND AFTER ALL THE JOKING,</i>

297
00:11:31,992 --> 00:11:33,892
<i> MIKE'S OBSESSED</i>
 <i> WITH MAKING SURE EVERY BURGER</i>

<i> IS EVERYTHING IT OUGHTA BE.</i>

299
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:37,595
WELL, I ALWAYS PLAYED
   THIS GAME IN MY HEAD

300
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:40,331
THAT EVERYONE THAT CAME IN WAS
 A WORLD-RENOWNED FOOD CRITIC,

301
00:11:40,434 --> 00:11:41,833
AND WE WANTED
     TO PLEASE 'EM.

302
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:43,568
WE WANTED TO MAKE THEM HAPPY
  SO THEY'D BRAG ON ME.

303
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:46,171
<i> ...WHICH MEANS HE'S KEEPING UP</i>
 <i> THE QUALITY ON EVERYTHING</i>

304
00:11:46,273 --> 00:11:48,440
<i> FROM TUNA SALAD TO BLTs.</i>

305
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:51,109
<i> AND HE'S GOT HIS</i>
  <i> 16-YEAR-OLD SON SHANE</i>

306

307
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,915
SO HE WAS BRED
   TO MAKE MILK SHAKES?
 ACTUALLY, HE WAS BORN WITH
A GREASY SPOON IN HIS MOUTH.

308
00:11:57,017 --> 00:12:00,785
SO TELL ME WHAT MAKES
    A GOOD MILK SHAKE.
GOOD ICE CREAM,
 GOOD MILK,

309
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:03,421
UH, THE METAL CUP.
    GOOD METAL THING?

310
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:05,123
YEAH, GOOD METAL THING.

311
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:06,725
WE'RE GONNA GET
SOME MALTED MILK.

312
00:12:06,827 --> 00:12:10,061
GONNA GET SOME STRAWBERRY.
  STUFF IT DOWN.

313
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:12,230
SEE, I LOVE WHEN THE THINGS
   ARE SPINNING,

314
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:14,432
THE JAM THING.
OH, YEAH, YOU GOTTA.

315
00:12:14,534 --> 00:12:16,534
JEEZ.

316
00:12:16,636 --> 00:12:19,637
IS THAT GOOD?

317
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,807
THAT'S MY BOY.
   THAT'S MY BOY.

318
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,743
THAT'S MY BOY.
  ...MAKING YOU PROUD.

319
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:26,211
LET ME ASK YOU
   A QUESTION.

320
00:12:26,313 --> 00:12:28,646
HOW MUCH IS THIS SHAKE THAT
 WE'RE EATING RIGHT HERE?

321
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:31,649
IT'S UNDER A HUNDRED
   DOLLARS, I KNOW THAT.

322
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:33,651
$4.75? THAT'S IT?

323
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:36,554
<i> HEY, THIS BABY'S ONLY $5.75,</i>

324
00:12:36,656 --> 00:12:38,123
<i> AND THE AMBIANCE IS FREE.</i>

325
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:40,658
WE GOT LIVER AND THEN
ONIONS RIGHT UP THERE.

326
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:41,860

I'M COMING BACK AS ME.

330
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:49,100

SUCH A GOOD TIME.

<i> WHERE IF IT SWIMS...</i>

333
00:12:53,507 --> 00:12:55,874

334
00:12:55,976 --> 00:12:57,709
<i> THIS GUY'LL COOK IT.</i>

  IT TASTES LIKE CHICKEN.

336

FUNNY, FUNNY.

337
00:13:04,651 --> 00:13:06,584
A LOT OF THE SEASIDE
  COMMUNITIES IN FLORIDA

338

INDIAN ROCKS BEACH--
 ABOUT 20 MILES WEST OF TAMPA.

341

NOW ONE OF THE THINGS
 THAT MAKES THIS PLACE SO COOL

342
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:16,694
IS PLACES LIKE THIS--

  TRY THEIR SPECIALTY.

347
00:13:24,271 --> 00:13:25,637
AND THEN
    I'M GONNA EAT IT?

348
00:13:25,739 --> 00:13:28,540
I'M HAVING CHARBROILED OCTOPUS.
  IT'S REALLY GOOD.

OHH.

351
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:34,312

THEY LOOK

370
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:21,326

SO FOUR OR MAYBE FIVE

THAT'S WHY PEOPLE COME HERE
THREE, FOUR TIMES A WEEK TO EAT,

375
00:14:29,736 --> 00:14:31,135

SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

425
00:16:42,936 --> 00:16:44,836
A DAY FOR THEM
TO PICK IT UP?

426
00:16:44,938 --> 00:16:48,506
A LITTLE OREGANO?
 YEAH, THIS IS ACTUALLY
ITALIAN SEASONING RIGHT HERE.

427
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:50,475
HOW ARE WE SERVING
    THE OCTOPUS TODAY--

428
00:16:50,577 --> 00:16:54,178
MEDIUM-RARE,
      AL DENTE?
IT'S ALWAYS AL DENTE.

429
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,749
I TELL YOU WHAT,
   THIS IS READY FOR YOU.
OH.

430
00:16:57,851 --> 00:17:01,052
AND THIS IS THE BREAKFAST
    OF CHAMPIONS.
YES, THAT IS.

431
00:17:01,154 --> 00:17:03,855
JUST ONE LEG
     AT A TIME,

432
00:17:03,957 --> 00:17:08,526
IF YOU LIKE IT
     THAT WAY.
 ONE LEG AT A TIME--
IS THAT OCTOPUS JOKES?

433
00:17:10,797 --> 00:17:12,830
YOU KNOW WHAT
THE HARD PART IS?

434
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:16,100
IT'S OCTOPUS.

435
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:18,636
THAT'S
THE TOUGH PART.

436
00:17:18,738 --> 00:17:20,872
IT'S BETTER
    THAN YOU THINK.
IT IS?

437
00:17:20,974 --> 00:17:25,043
YEAH. IT TASTES
    LIKE A CHICKEN.
 I SEE ME EATING--
IT TASTES LIKE CHICKEN.

438
00:17:25,145 --> 00:17:27,045
FUNNY, FUNNY.

439
00:17:27,147 --> 00:17:30,481
MMM.
IT DOES HAVE, LIKE, A LOBSTER
  CONSISTENCY, THOUGH.

440
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:34,052
AND IT'S NOT AS CHEWY
AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.

441
00:17:34,154 --> 00:17:36,854
THE FLAVOR
IS REALLY GOOD.

442
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:39,190
THAT REALLY IS--I GOTTA
 HAND IT TO YOU, CHEF.

443
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:40,691
I'D EAT THAT AGAIN.

444
00:17:40,794 --> 00:17:43,428
THEY KNOW HOW TO MAKE IT TENDER.
  THAT'S TOUGH TO DO,

445
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:46,197
IF YOU DON'T MIND THE PUN.

446
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:48,566
<i> AND CéSAR LIVES</i>

<i> BUT IS IT THE REAL DEAL?</i>

451
00:17:56,042 --> 00:17:57,742
DRIVING THIS BUS

452

<i>WHEN YOU HIT INDIAN ROCKS BEACH</i>

00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:23,634
ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS HERE.

461
00:18:23,736 --> 00:18:26,537
LOOK AT THIS BUFFET.
WE HAVE SOME CRABS
 AND SOME SHRIMPS

462
00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:28,239
WITH THE HEAD ON.

463
00:18:28,341 --> 00:18:31,142

      YOU HAD ME
      AT HELLO.

464
00:18:31,244 --> 00:18:32,743
SIMPLE ENOUGH.
      I DIG IT.

465
00:18:32,846 --> 00:18:35,880
AND, OF COURSE, THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING--A ROUX.
     LOOK AT THAT.

466
00:18:35,982 --> 00:18:38,216
I'M GONNA DO THE ANDOUILLE
   SAUSAGE FIRST.

467
00:18:38,318 --> 00:18:41,018
ONION RIGHT IN.

CELERY?

469

470
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:47,959
AND STARTED
     THE CHICKEN.

471
00:18:48,061 --> 00:18:50,027
WE USE ALL
     THE FAT ON IT,

472
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,263
BECAUSE I WANT
    TO RENDER THAT FAT.

I'VE NEVER
TASTED THIS WAY.

488

THERE'S NO MIXTURE IN IT.
  IT'S JUST CORN FLOUR.

71
00:02:45,132 --> 00:02:47,699
CORN FLOUR? NO SALT?
NO PEPPER? NO GARLIC POWDER?

00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,140
AND IT'S--BUT IT'S NEVER
  AN OLD CLAM TASTE.

90
00:03:28,242 --> 00:03:29,875
YOU TASTE THE SEAFOOD MORE THAN
  YOU TASTE THE FRIED.

OH, IT'S WONDERFUL.
  IT'S REALLY GOOD.

      EATIN' CLAMS!

96
00:03:40,154 --> 00:03:42,087
WE CAME THE WHOLE WAY TO GET
 AN ORDER OF FRIED CLAMS.

97
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:44,056
<i> BUT AS BIG AS THE CLAMS</i>
<i> ARE HERE...</i>
THE WHOLE THING.

98
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:47,125
<i> FOR LOTS OF FOLKS, THEY'RE</i>
 <i> JUST PART OF THE MAIN EVENT.</i>

99
00:03:47,228 --> 00:03:51,296
THE NUMBER ONE-SELLING ITEM
  ON THE MENU?
    IS THE FISHERMAN'S
     COMBO.

100
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:53,265
FISHERMAN'S COMBO--HOW'D YOU
 COME UP WITH THE NAME?

101
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:54,866
<i> IT'S GOT IT ALL--</i>
  <i> FISH, SCALLOPS,</i>

102
00:03:54,969 --> 00:03:57,803
<i> SHRIMP, CLAMS, RINGS</i>
   <i> AND FRIES.</i>

103
00:03:57,905 --> 00:04:01,106
THAT'S A BIG PLATE OF FRIED.
 YOU SHOULD FRY THE PLATE, TOO.

104
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:03,108
NOW YOU CAN TOSS
IT ALL TOGETHER?

105
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,110
OR YOU DO IT INDIVIDUALLY?
    I ACTUALLY COOK 'EM
    IN TWO GROUPS.

106
00:04:05,212 --> 00:04:09,081
'KAY.
   THE SCALLOPS AND FISH
   CAN GO IN ONE FRYER.

107
00:04:09,183 --> 00:04:10,582
ONCE I DREDGE EVERYTHING,

108
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:13,151
I'M JUST MAKIN' SURE
   EVERYTHING'S COVERED,

109
00:04:13,254 --> 00:04:15,187
SO THE COATING
    WHEN IT'S COOKED

110
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:16,688
WILL BE UNIFORM.

111
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,690
WE'LL LAY THE FISH
     DOWN FLAT.

112
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:20,692
SCALLOPS WITHOUT
    COVERING THE FISH,

113
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:22,694
'CAUSE THAT'LL EFFECT
    THE COATING,

114
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:25,130
SO WE HAVE TO KIND OF
   SEPARATE THOSE TWO.

115
00:04:25,232 --> 00:04:27,132
SHRIMP AND CLAMS--TAKE AS MUCH
 OF THE EXTRA LOOSE STUFF

116
00:04:27,234 --> 00:04:29,134
OUTTA THERE, SO I'M NOT
 THROWING A BUNCH OF CORN FLOUR

117
00:04:29,236 --> 00:04:30,636
IN THE MIX.

118
00:04:30,738 --> 00:04:32,638
THE SCALLOPS AND
  THE FLOUNDER TAKE LONGER.

119
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,640
MAYBE THREE OR FOUR
    MINUTES TO COOK.

120
00:04:34,742 --> 00:04:36,642
THE RINGS MIGHT TAKE TWO
  TO THREE MINUTES TO COOK.

121
00:04:36,744 --> 00:04:38,810
I LIKE THAT COLOR. IT'S JUST
  BEYOND THE CANARY YELLOW

122
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:42,347
INTO A BROWNISH STAGE.
 IF YOU'VE DONE YOUR
TIMING EXACTLY RIGHT?

123
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:44,950
IT ALL COMES OUT AT ONCE.
   THAT'S A HANDFUL.

124
00:04:45,052 --> 00:04:48,287
FISH LOOKS NICE AND LIGHT
  AND FLAKY.

125
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:51,123
IT'S TASTY FISH.

126
00:04:51,225 --> 00:04:52,758
THESE SHRIMP ARE MINE.

127
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,394
AND THEN THE SCALLOPS--
    DAY SCALLOPS?
YES.

128
00:04:55,496 --> 00:04:57,396
'CAUSE THEY CAUGHT
     'EM THAT DAY?

129
00:04:57,498 --> 00:04:59,231
MMM, SCALLOPS
   ARE NICE AND TENDER.
YEAH.

130
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:01,700
SCALLOPS THAT ARE JUST, YOU

<i> EVERYTHING IS.</i>

00:05:03,604 --> 00:05:05,137
PART OF MY JOB IS--

133
00:05:05,239 --> 00:05:06,905
IS TO TALK
 TO THE SEAFOOD GUYS DAILY--

134
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:08,907
"WHAT DO YOU GOT?
   WHAT'S GOOD?"

135
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:11,276
SOME DAYS I MIGHT NOT ORDER.
 SOME DAYS I ORDER HEAVY.

136
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:13,845
<i> BUT WHATEVER HE'S GOT</i>
<i> THAT DAY...</i>
OH, THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.

137
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:16,581
<i> JOE'S RULE IS--</i>
 <i> LET THE SEAFOOD DO THE TALKING</i>

138
00:05:16,684 --> 00:05:18,016
<i> AS MANY WAYS AS IT CAN.</i>

139
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:20,819
CLAM CHOWDER--
AND THIS IS GREAT CHOWDER?

140

 BACK AND WORK FOR THE FAMILY.

216

AND WHY?

219
00:08:23,237 --> 00:08:25,270
YOU HAVE TO TENDERIZE

OR ELSE IT'S GONNA TASTE
   LIKE SHOE LEATHER.

221
00:08:27,274 --> 00:08:29,641

  DON'T EAT GIZZARDS AT HOME.

222
00:08:29,743 --> 00:08:32,477
WHAT SEASONINGS

 UH, I CAN'T

229
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,061

244
00:09:22,496 --> 00:09:23,728

       YES.

245
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,897
I DON'T WANT TO BE A HOG
   AND HAVE 'EM ALL.

246
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:27,566
SERIOUSLY, SAVE SOME
    FOR YOURSELF.

247

ONLY AT JOE'S.

284
00:10:51,118 --> 00:10:52,884
<i> THEY'RE BIG ON DIFFERENT HERE,</i>

285
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,819
<i> LIKE DEEP-FRIED HOT DOGS</i>
  <i> WITH MELTED CHEESE.</i>

286
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:58,256
THESE ARE...
  DEEP-FRIED OREOS.

287
00:10:58,358 --> 00:10:59,624
THEY ARE SO GOOD.

288
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:01,593
<i> EVEN DEEP-FRIED TWINKIES.</i>

289
00:11:01,695 --> 00:11:04,429
<i> THEY CALL 'EM FRINKIES.</i>
YEAH.

290
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:07,565
THAT MIGHT BE ILLEGAL
     TO SERVE.

291
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:12,470
I MEAN, THAT'S FREAKY.

292
00:11:12,572 --> 00:11:15,306
<i> BUT IF YOU WANT FREAKY,</i>
 <i> HOW 'BOUT A DEEP-FRIED BURGER?</i>

293
00:11:15,409 --> 00:11:17,375
SO YOU SAID,
"LET'S COOK THE BURGER..."
       YEAH.

294
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:20,111
"AND THEN LET'S BATTER IT,
AND THEN LET'S FRY IT..."
       YEAH.

295
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:21,646
"AND PUT IT IN A BURGER."
       YEP.

296
00:11:21,748 --> 00:11:23,648
I GOTTA TELL YOU,
  THERE'S A FEW THINGS

297
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,583

DEEP-FRIED PATTY IN BATTER.

299
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:33,692
MMM, I LIKE THAT.

300
00:11:33,794 --> 00:11:35,694
YOU DO TASTE THE CRUNCH,
   AND IT ALSO CHANGES

301
00:11:35,796 --> 00:11:37,729
THE FLAVOR OF
   THE MEAT A LITTLE BIT.

302
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:39,230
I'D GET IT THAT WAY VERSUS
   THE REGULAR WAY.

303
00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:41,232
IT'S VERY GOOD.
CRUNCHY?

304
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:43,234
A LITTLE CRUNCH
    ON THE OUTSIDE...

305
00:11:43,336 --> 00:11:45,470
SOFT AND JUICY
    ON THE INSIDE.

YOU'RE DOIN' COMMERCIALS.

307
00:11:47,174 --> 00:11:49,974
<i> BUT AS GOOD AS THAT IS,</i>
 <i> WHY FRY JUST THE BURGER?</i>

308
00:11:50,077 --> 00:11:52,510
<i> LET'S BATTER THE WHOLE THING,</i>
   <i> BUN AND ALL.</i>

319
00:12:19,272 --> 00:12:21,473
<i> JOE'S PUT IT ON THE MENU NOW,</i>
 <i> AS THE TRIPLE D BURGER.</i>

320
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:24,576
SERIOUSLY, I WOULD ORDER ONE OF
THOSE EVERY TIME I CAME IN HERE.

321
00:12:24,678 --> 00:12:26,811

JOE AND JOEY HAVE ALWAYS
 HAD SOMETHING UNIQUE.

325
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:37,355

431
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:48,139
IT'S SMALLER.

432
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:49,741
YOU HAVE A LICENSE FOR THIS?

00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:37,121
IT'S PORTUGUESI-AMERICANI.

452
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:40,391
"PORTUGUESI-AMERICANI"
  DID YOU SAY?

453

459
00:17:56,142 --> 00:17:58,042
AND DO YOU TYPICALLY
    WORK TOGETHER,

460
00:17:58,144 --> 00:18:00,044
OR DOES ONE TYPICALLY OPEN AND
 THE OTHER PERSON CLOSES?

461
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:02,046
I OPEN, HE CLOSES.
    WHEN DO YOU GUYS
     SEE EACH OTHER?

462
00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:05,683
WE DON'T. THAT'S WHY OUR

00:18:16,396 --> 00:18:18,796
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA IS KNOWN
  FOR A LOT OF THINGS.

468
00:18:18,898 --> 00:18:21,532
ONE OF MY FAVORITES

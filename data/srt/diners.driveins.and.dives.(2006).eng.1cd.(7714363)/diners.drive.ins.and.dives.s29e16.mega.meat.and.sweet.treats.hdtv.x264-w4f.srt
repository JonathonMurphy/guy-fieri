1
00:00:01,068 --> 00:00:02,134
           Hey, there.

2
00:00:02,136 --> 00:00:03,602
         I'm Guy Fieri,
     and we're rolling out,

3
00:00:03,604 --> 00:00:06,972
 looking for America's greatest
  diners, drive-ins, and dives.

4
00:00:06,974 --> 00:00:08,474
          This trip...
      Poof!

5
00:00:08,476 --> 00:00:10,209
        ...we're digging
       into mega meats...

6
00:00:10,211 --> 00:00:12,044
I like it juicy.

7
00:00:12,046 --> 00:00:13,512
   ...and some sweet treats...

8
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:15,881
Today,
  the cinnamon roll anaconda.

9
00:00:15,883 --> 00:00:18,884
   ...like Holy Moly Stromboli
        in Washington...

10
00:00:18,886 --> 00:00:20,886
    You've got to
   be kidding me.

11
00:00:20,888 --> 00:00:23,455
   ...an Asian-Mexican mash-up
          in Atlanta...

12
00:00:23,457 --> 00:00:25,557
              That's a jam band
             right there, dude.

13
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:27,993
   ...and prime-time pastrami
           in Austin.

14
00:00:27,995 --> 00:00:28,794
                   Ho-ho!

15
00:00:28,796 --> 00:00:30,262
      Plus, along the way,

16
00:00:30,264 --> 00:00:32,264
       pastries that will
        boggle your mind.

17
00:00:32,266 --> 00:00:34,900
 I have always said,
"If it's funky, I'll find it."

18
00:00:34,902 --> 00:00:38,537
You might be getting
the freaky-funky award.

19
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:41,073
That's all right here,
   right now,

20
00:00:41,075 --> 00:00:43,542
 on "Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives."

21
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:45,110
Yeah!

22
00:00:57,491 --> 00:01:00,092
 So, we're here on the southwest
     side of Austin, Texas.

23
00:01:00,094 --> 00:01:02,661
   Now, a "Triple D" statement
     that we always make is,

24
00:01:02,663 --> 00:01:04,696
       "Don't judge a book
         by its cover."

25
00:01:04,698 --> 00:01:06,665
      But what happens when
     you're going to a place

26
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:08,333
  and the name, it says pizza,

27
00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:10,335
        but they're known
      for awesome pastries,

28
00:01:10,337 --> 00:01:12,838
         amazing bread,
      and killer pastrami?

29
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,975
 Well, we're about to find out,
     'cause this is Pieous.

30
00:01:16,977 --> 00:01:18,544
          House on Fire
        and a margherita.

31
00:01:18,546 --> 00:01:20,279
You would think
  it's a pizza place

32
00:01:20,281 --> 00:01:22,548
       or maybe a bakery,
     but it's so much more.

33
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:24,883
       One pastrami chili,
      fixings on the side.

34
00:01:24,885 --> 00:01:26,418
              I just feel like
                 it's a gem.

35
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,821
      Megan is a producer for us
       on "Guy's Grocery Games."

36
00:01:28,823 --> 00:01:31,523
   One of my favorite chefs, you
   really know a ton about food.

37
00:01:31,525 --> 00:01:34,426
I think what's going on here
is high-end, chef-driven food.

38
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:37,396
From two people who didn't
 actually start out as chefs.

39
00:01:37,398 --> 00:01:40,866
We worked in the music business,
but we didn't like what we did.

40
00:01:40,868 --> 00:01:42,234
          Did you become lawyers
              and accountants?

41
00:01:42,236 --> 00:01:43,435
    Yes.      Yes.
                       Okay.

42
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:45,537
      We talked about doing
      a restaurant forever.

43
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:47,973
Finally, Josh
 and Paige Kaner went for it

44
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:50,008
     and started serving up
       the food they love.

45
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:52,511
             You make the pizza.
            You're baking bread.

46
00:01:52,513 --> 00:01:53,745
          You're doing pastrami.

47
00:01:53,747 --> 00:01:56,115
Juicy pastrami sandwich,
   table 20.

48
00:01:56,117 --> 00:01:59,184
        Their pastrami is
    in a world of their own.

49
00:01:59,186 --> 00:02:02,855
 The sourdough bread is awesome.
       It's art in itself.

50
00:02:02,857 --> 00:02:04,923
        The pastrami that I hear
               is to die for,

51
00:02:04,925 --> 00:02:06,225
            give me the rundown,
                  brother.

52
00:02:06,227 --> 00:02:08,794
We have to cure it for 20 days
 before we smoke it.

53
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:10,796
           Most people are happy
                 with seven.

54
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:13,132
So...

55
00:02:14,135 --> 00:02:15,868
     We're gonna
 build our brine --

56
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:19,505
kosher salt, curing salts,
a little bit of hot water.

57
00:02:19,507 --> 00:02:21,073
  We're gonna dump
  a bunch of water.

58
00:02:21,075 --> 00:02:22,074
              To cool it down.

59
00:02:22,076 --> 00:02:24,109
     Cover this.
   Pureed garlic.

60
00:02:24,111 --> 00:02:25,177
              That much garlic.

61
00:02:25,179 --> 00:02:27,146
     Onion.
                For one brisket?

62
00:02:27,148 --> 00:02:28,647
        Yeah.
  Black peppercorn.

63
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:29,982
Put it in the deep cooler.

64
00:02:29,984 --> 00:02:32,384
   20 days later,
we're gonna make our rub.
                       Got it.

65
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:35,721
Black pepper, paprika,
 garlic, coriander.

66
00:02:35,723 --> 00:02:37,789
              This is gonna get
       rubbed on here liberally.

67
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,158
     Let it sit
for about a half-hour

68
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,760
for the juices to kind of
come out and grab the seasoning.

69
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:42,828
         How long on the smoker?

70
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,930
   10 to 13 hours,
depending on the size.

71
00:02:44,932 --> 00:02:46,798
          Depending on the size?
              You do the feel?
    Yep.

72
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,467
              We're gonna make
          sourdough bread dough.

73
00:02:48,469 --> 00:02:50,903
      So you just set this thing
       right here and hit start,

74
00:02:50,905 --> 00:02:53,338
    and that is gonna deliver me
       the exact amount of water

75
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,673
              every single time

76
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:57,543
           so my sourdough bread
   is as consistent as possible.

77
00:02:57,545 --> 00:02:58,844
  Nice to meet you.

78
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:00,112
I'm leaving.

79
00:03:00,114 --> 00:03:01,413
This is ridiculous.
                Isn't that cool?

80
00:03:01,415 --> 00:03:02,915
                   This is
          our sourdough starter.

81
00:03:02,917 --> 00:03:04,917
  Gorgeous.
           This is 20 years old.

82
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:06,318
It just wafts the air.

83
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,755
             And we're gonna add
     high-gluten, organic flour.

84
00:03:09,757 --> 00:03:10,923
      You know
what's really terrible

85
00:03:10,925 --> 00:03:12,624
   is that a dude
from the music business

86
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:15,160
   is chefing this
to the ninth degree.

87
00:03:15,162 --> 00:03:19,364
    Give it a good mix, salt it,
  proof this for like six hours,

88
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:21,600
            put it in the cooler
         for another 24 hours...

89
00:03:21,602 --> 00:03:23,268
 Okay, to really let
 that flavor build?
         ...before we take it --

90
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,770
                          Yes.
   And then start
 to make the bread?

91
00:03:24,772 --> 00:03:26,505
                    Yes, sir.
   I love it.

92
00:03:26,507 --> 00:03:28,006
  We're gonna make
a pastrami sandwich.

93
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:29,808
I like it juicy.

94
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,310
               Make it a-nice.

95
00:03:31,312 --> 00:03:33,345
Ho-ho!
  Look at the bark on that.

96
00:03:33,347 --> 00:03:35,647
     Sourdough,
whole-grain mustard.

97
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:38,283
     Oh, so you're going full-on
          Katz's Deli with this.

98
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:39,851
Let you be the judge.

99
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:44,223
Couple kosher pickles,
house-pickled onions.

100
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:46,058
                That onion's
              nice little kiss.

101
00:03:49,063 --> 00:03:50,395
               Delicious bark.

102
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:52,664
      It's got the right pepper,
       got a touch of coriander.

103
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:55,734
               Not over-salty,
      which is always the curse.

104
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:58,270
        You got this thin bread,
       and it's not coming apart

105
00:03:58,272 --> 00:04:00,606
               as you shove it
              in your facehole.

106
00:04:00,608 --> 00:04:02,441
     The pièce de résistance is,
              without question,

107
00:04:02,443 --> 00:04:05,043
             the pickled onion,
      which cleanses the palate.

108
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:06,845
         That's a badge of honor
             right there, buddy.

109
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:08,780
        I'll take three of those
                   to go.

110
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:10,749
        The pastrami will
      knock your socks off.

111
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:13,819
Reminds me of New York, where
 there's more meat than bread.

112
00:04:13,821 --> 00:04:16,121
    Homemade sourdough bread
     is just another level.

113
00:04:16,123 --> 00:04:19,124
And the mustard just adds
enough of that tang.

114
00:04:19,126 --> 00:04:21,026
     When my friends come in
 from out of town, I tell them,

115
00:04:21,028 --> 00:04:23,595
 "Hey, I'm gonna take you to get
   some life-changing pastrami

116
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:24,830
      and some good pizza."

117
00:04:24,832 --> 00:04:26,565
I got the Fat Queen going in.

118
00:04:26,567 --> 00:04:29,101
  They got this incredible oven
    they imported from Italy.

119
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:30,402
       I got a margherita.

120
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:31,870
   Everything is scratch-made.

121
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:36,074
It's just the level of detail
in every layer of every dish.

122
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:37,709
And when it comes
  to their desserts,

123
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:39,878
     they take those layers
           literally.

124
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,847
 We're gonna laminate this thing
               how many times?

125
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:44,616
81 layers.
      81 layers?

126
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:46,918
      Now that's how you do
         a caramel roll!

127
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,620
Caramel roll's going to table 4.

128
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:51,356
  Even if we're not even hungry
      for dessert anymore,

129
00:04:51,358 --> 00:04:54,493
       we can't leave here
     without ordering this.

130
00:04:54,495 --> 00:04:56,194
And that's when we come back.

131
00:04:56,196 --> 00:04:59,698
 Shut the front door, back door,
                 side door.

132
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,932
             Shut all the doors.

133
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:05,437
            Go, hut!

134
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:07,439
             Get it!
          There ya go!

135
00:05:07,441 --> 00:05:09,007
 All right, I got to go to work.

136
00:05:10,344 --> 00:05:11,476
                Welcome back.

137
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:13,845
   Hanging out in Austin, Texas,
                 at Pieous.

138
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:16,381
  You see the name and you think
       they make a bunch of pie.

139
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:18,984
                  They do.
  Neapolitan pizza -- fantastic.

140
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:20,986
             But the story goes
          even deeper than that.

141
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:22,421
       You don't just come
         for the pizza.

142
00:05:22,423 --> 00:05:24,423
        Sometimes we come
     just for the desserts,

143
00:05:24,425 --> 00:05:26,391
      because the desserts
          are amazing.

144
00:05:26,393 --> 00:05:27,826
Caramel roll going to 10.

145
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,361
  The caramel roll's delicious.

146
00:05:29,363 --> 00:05:32,397
    That croissant-like crisp
     outside, gooey inside.

147
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,633
 It's like genius-level pastry.

148
00:05:34,635 --> 00:05:36,001
       Did you ever see the show

149
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:37,836
              when Hunter and I
             went through Europe

150
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,671
           and we were in France
      and we made the croissant?

151
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,773
  Stretch it here,
  and you roll it.

152
00:05:41,775 --> 00:05:44,910
         But if you didn't watch
      that episode, tune in now.

153
00:05:44,912 --> 00:05:46,411
              We're now making
              croissant dough.

154
00:05:46,413 --> 00:05:47,479
     81 layers.

155
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:48,947
                 81 layers?

156
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:52,284
Start with the sourdough
starter, high-gluten flour.

157
00:05:52,286 --> 00:05:53,685
    Sugar, milk.

158
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:55,220
Diastatic malt powder.
                     Got it.

159
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:57,356
This is gonna give it
a good flavor and good color.

160
00:05:57,358 --> 00:05:59,291
                       Okay.
Butter and water.

161
00:05:59,293 --> 00:06:00,559
                  My mouth
          just started to water.

162
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:02,427
    Let it relax.
    Add the salt.

163
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:04,363
And we're gonna run it
for about five minutes.

164
00:06:04,365 --> 00:06:06,131
             Okay, where we at?
 Caramel sauce.

165
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:09,067
We're gonna start with butter,
the brown sugar, little water,

166
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:11,670
little bit of corn syrup,
    heavy cream,

167
00:06:11,672 --> 00:06:13,939
   pinch of salt,
 vanilla bean paste.

168
00:06:13,941 --> 00:06:16,041
            Okay, so we're gonna
             let this cook down.

169
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:17,409
               Now let's start
               the lamination.

170
00:06:17,411 --> 00:06:18,710
       This is
our croissant dough.

171
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:19,945
                Cold and hard
                like butter.

172
00:06:19,947 --> 00:06:21,146
 Speaking of butter.

173
00:06:21,148 --> 00:06:22,347
             Oh, no, that's not
         gonna happen right now.

174
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:24,649
We have some butter,
right in the middle.

175
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:25,784
    Fold it over.

176
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:27,285
Now we're gonna put it
through the sheeter.

177
00:06:27,287 --> 00:06:29,521
  You want to try it?
                  'Course I do.

178
00:06:29,523 --> 00:06:31,857
     Okay, good.
Now drop it down to 16.
                     Okay.

179
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:33,325
          You think I can count.

180
00:06:33,327 --> 00:06:34,893
          Ah, this is so my job.

181
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:36,995
   Until you don't pay attention
        and it goes off the edge

182
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:38,497
         and falls on the floor.

183
00:06:38,499 --> 00:06:39,731
                    Whoa!

184
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,867
       It's like Lucy and Ethel.

185
00:06:41,869 --> 00:06:43,535
So now we got to make this
    look pretty.

186
00:06:43,537 --> 00:06:45,904
I did a-nice.

187
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:47,572
Right in    the middle of the fold?
 Yep.

188
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,708
              Three more times
               of this again?
Same way.

189
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:52,010
            Back in the...cooler
Cooler. For at least an hour.

190
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:53,011
         -Two more runs.
              -Yep.

191
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:54,413
               Then roll it up
                 on the pin.

192
00:06:54,415 --> 00:06:56,948
            I mean, this is like
      "Caramel Rolls Gone Wild."

193
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:00,218
We're gonna start with cinnamon,
brown sugar, Texas pecans.

194
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,553
Roll this into a log.

195
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:02,954
             Were you this good
              of an accountant?

196
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:04,356
No.

197
00:07:04,358 --> 00:07:06,792
So, I want this edge
to stick to this edge.

198
00:07:06,794 --> 00:07:09,060
                       Got it.
So I'm gonna kind of dock it
    a little bit,

199
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:11,062
kind of bring out that butter,
and then it will attach.

200
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:12,898
     You're licking the envelope
             right there, buddy.

201
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,566
                 Welcome to
             the Flavortown Zoo.

202
00:07:14,568 --> 00:07:16,935
        Today, the cinnamon roll
                  anaconda.

203
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:20,005
Then we've got to mark it
so we know where to cut it.

204
00:07:20,007 --> 00:07:22,174
      Next up,
we have the caramel.

205
00:07:22,176 --> 00:07:23,175
             Oh, great caramel.

206
00:07:23,177 --> 00:07:25,143
Add some more pecans
   to the bottom.

207
00:07:25,145 --> 00:07:26,211
       -And stick them in.
             -Okay.

208
00:07:26,213 --> 00:07:28,046
              This exceeds what
              I've seen before.

209
00:07:28,048 --> 00:07:30,615
This is not even close
   to being done.
                      Of course.

210
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:31,883
     We have to
   proof this now.

211
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:33,485
             He's not for real,
           ladies and gentlemen.

212
00:07:33,487 --> 00:07:34,653
              I'm being punked.

213
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,121
 So, now they're out
    of the oven.

214
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:38,156
            -Got it.
           -Do a flip.

215
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:39,558
               You want to get
               a good release.

216
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,059
            That's sugar napalm.

217
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:42,093
  It's gonna hurt.

218
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:44,763
Unh, ow!

219
00:07:44,765 --> 00:07:45,931
                    Wow!

220
00:07:47,935 --> 00:07:49,768
                 Delicious.
        Nice little bit of salt.

221
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:50,836
               Great vanilla.

222
00:07:50,838 --> 00:07:52,671
      Sugar-to-cinnamon balance,
                 fantastic.

223
00:07:52,673 --> 00:07:54,072
       Flakiness of the dough --

224
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:56,441
I mean, just like all the levels
              of righteousness.

225
00:07:56,443 --> 00:08:00,846
         One of the most unique,
delicate pastries that I've had.

226
00:08:00,848 --> 00:08:03,882
        That right there is what
every cinnamon roll wants to be.

227
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:05,817
                That's crazy.

228
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,152
    Here's the caramel roll.

229
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:08,720
I dig right
    to the middle.

230
00:08:08,722 --> 00:08:10,956
    You got to have that crunchy
   part of it, and it's so good.

231
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,157
It's so sweet.

232
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:14,493
       The nuts on the top
     just really set it off.

233
00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:16,194
         Pastrami chili.

234
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:17,496
I never leave here with food

235
00:08:17,498 --> 00:08:18,930
       because we wind up
         eating it all.

236
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:19,931
     That's how good it is.

237
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:21,032
I'm really impressed.

238
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:22,968
        You took that discipline
             and responsibility

239
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:25,003
         of being an accountant,
           and you can taste it.

240
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:27,806
      Everything that I'm seeing
    you do is of the next level.

241
00:08:27,808 --> 00:08:29,274
                Well done, Chef.
                It's delicious.
Thank you, Guy.

242
00:08:29,276 --> 00:08:31,409
       Wrap up my cinnamon rolls
         and get me my pastrami,

243
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:32,444
         'cause I'm out of here.

244
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:38,116
Up next, a joint in
 Atlanta taking Korean flavor...

245
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:39,417
          I'll have more of that
                 every day.

246
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:40,752
     ...mixing in Mexican...

247
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:41,820
                  Hold on.

248
00:08:41,822 --> 00:08:44,189
        ...and tossing in
       an American touch.

249
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:45,357
                   I mean,
        this is powerhouse, bro.

250
00:08:51,265 --> 00:08:53,832
       So I'm here in the
  West Midtown area of Atlanta

251
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:56,535
     to, well, not check out
     a joint for soul food.

252
00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:58,403
    No, I'm here to check out
   a joint that's doing tacos.

253
00:08:58,405 --> 00:09:00,105
      Well, and they're not
       really even tacos.

254
00:09:00,107 --> 00:09:01,506
   They're doing Korean food.

255
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:04,042
   Well, it's not even Korean.
  It's more like Korean tacos.

256
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,977
   I know this is a mouthful,
  but you got to check it out.

257
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:09,381
    This is Hankook Taqueria.

258
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:11,550
   Tongdak taco, shrimp taco.

259
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:12,951
      It's hard to believe
  that I've found a restaurant

260
00:09:12,953 --> 00:09:15,520
     that I can't go a week
       without eating at.

261
00:09:15,522 --> 00:09:16,655
     The food is that good.

262
00:09:16,657 --> 00:09:18,056
     -Bulgogi kimchi fries?
             -Yeah.

263
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:20,458
It's Mexican-Korean fusion,
 and I've never heard of that

264
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,993
       before I came here
         the first time.

265
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:24,663
And that mash-up
comes from husband-and-wife team

266
00:09:24,665 --> 00:09:26,998
    Tomas and Mackenzie Lee.

267
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,101
"Hankook" actually means
 "Korean" in Korean.

268
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:33,004
So, what we're doing is
 taking authentic Korean food

269
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:35,874
           and using the vessels
              of Mexican food.

270
00:09:35,876 --> 00:09:37,475
          You're just funkifying
                the flavors.

271
00:09:37,477 --> 00:09:38,543
          -Absolutely.
            -Got it.

272
00:09:38,545 --> 00:09:39,778
          Tongdak taco.

273
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,246
         The tongdak's the best.

274
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:42,647
 The fried chicken's delicious.

275
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:45,517
   Lightly breaded with a good
sauce on there, bunch of flavor.

276
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:46,685
       All right, so what are we
            going to make today?

277
00:09:46,687 --> 00:09:48,153
Tongdak fried chicken tacos.

278
00:09:48,155 --> 00:09:50,088
   "Tongdak" means
Korean fried chicken.

279
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,790
         -Speak Korean?
   -No, I don't speak Korean.

280
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:53,358
  -Does your wife speak Korean?
           -She does.

281
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,226
 She has a Southern
   Korean accent.

282
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:57,362
                South Georgia
               Korean accent.
  Accent.

283
00:09:57,364 --> 00:09:58,730
                  Awesome!

284
00:09:58,732 --> 00:10:00,498
We're gonna make our vinaigrette
   to start with.

285
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,934
     Soy sauce,
white vinegar, sugar,

286
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:05,537
Korean chili flakes,
  pure sesame oil.

287
00:10:05,539 --> 00:10:06,972
          I'll have more of that
                 every day.

288
00:10:06,974 --> 00:10:08,440
              This is the salad
          that goes on the taco?

289
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:11,810
Yes, sir, and then we also
add onions and then cilantro.

290
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,045
              That's delicious.

291
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:15,513
Next step, we're gonna
  make the marinade

292
00:10:15,515 --> 00:10:16,748
for the chicken tenders.

293
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,584
The tenders tend to...
                Be more tender?

294
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:21,820
We'll add our buttermilk,
  salt/pepper mix.

295
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:22,921
          So, let these marinate
                 overnight,

296
00:10:22,923 --> 00:10:24,089
          then what are we gonna
               batter them in?

297
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:25,757
 All-purpose flour,
     rice flour.

298
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:27,492
    -For the crunchification?
             -Right.

299
00:10:27,494 --> 00:10:31,463
Cornstarch, garlic powder,
onion powder, salt/pepper mix.

300
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:33,465
         Let's fry some chicken.
   All right.

301
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:34,933
Here's our warm tortillas,

302
00:10:34,935 --> 00:10:37,302
tongdak fried chicken,
   chipotle aioli.

303
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:39,971
Soy sesame salad on top,
    Jack cheese.

304
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:42,107
          Not Mexican or Korean.

305
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:44,075
 We're American, because we just
         put cheese on the taco.

306
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:45,510
     That's what
  the people want.

307
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:52,951
     I'm in such a weird paradox
                 right now.

308
00:10:52,953 --> 00:10:54,986
            Coming to the South,
   having fried chicken, got it.

309
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,355
       Having a taco in Atlanta,
               not quite sure.

310
00:10:57,357 --> 00:10:59,491
      But then when you throw in
              this Korean thing

311
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:00,925
     and then spin it all around

312
00:11:00,927 --> 00:11:03,128
    and throw some cheese on top
          of it, it's delicious.

313
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:05,463
  Great crunch from the chicken,
           super-tender chicken.

314
00:11:05,465 --> 00:11:07,332
 You get a really nice, good hit
             from the chipotle,

315
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:09,167
          but the finishing note
               of that salad.

316
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,536
        You're really picking up
              this sesame oil.

317
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:13,104
   The only thing really Mexican
                going on here

318
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:14,539
               is the chipotle
              and the tortilla.

319
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:16,441
           After that, Elvis has
             left the building.
That's right.

320
00:11:16,443 --> 00:11:17,876
              But when it comes
                 to flavor,

321
00:11:17,878 --> 00:11:20,045
       I mean, that's a jam band
             right there, dude.

322
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:21,246
       Fried-chicken taco?

323
00:11:21,248 --> 00:11:23,348
           I love the mash-up --
           the Southern chicken,

324
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,649
           and I love the cheese
                   on top.

325
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:26,184
        These ladies are
      some friends of mine

326
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:27,619
    from northern California,

327
00:11:27,621 --> 00:11:31,256
and they raised a bunch of money
    to help out some seniors

328
00:11:31,258 --> 00:11:33,258
         displaced from
 the terrible fires that we had.

329
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,794
 What do you think of this combo
     of Korean and Mexican?

330
00:11:35,796 --> 00:11:38,029
          -Hella good.
          -Hella good.

331
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:39,164
          Kimchi fries.

332
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,666
      Tomas is a great guy
      and a fabulous chef.

333
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:43,902
But it's easy to see
 that his wife, Mackenzie,

334
00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:46,204
           is the one
    really running the show.

335
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:47,372
         How's he doing?

336
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:48,973
    We don't know why he doesn't
             speak more Korean.

337
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:52,077
    My dad asked him the same
 question when he first met him.

338
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,513
      He was very firm about how
 things go in this relationship.

339
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:57,982
  And he said, "I wear the pants
               in the family."

340
00:11:57,984 --> 00:12:00,485
   That's right, but I get to
   pick it out in the morning.

341
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:03,788
                    And?

342
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,156
     Those are not the ones
          that I chose.

343
00:12:06,827 --> 00:12:10,829
   Can you explain to me how you
      would say the bulgogi dish

344
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:12,063
           in -- in full Korean?

345
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,031
        Like "prr-gogi."

346
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:15,200
         How do you say "fries"?
             Fries.

347
00:12:15,202 --> 00:12:16,534
              There's no "prr"
             in the front of it?

348
00:12:16,536 --> 00:12:17,702
   Almost French.

349
00:12:17,704 --> 00:12:20,138
And together,
 they make a killer combo.

350
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:23,875
  The bulgogi kimchi fries are
  almost like a Korean poutine.

351
00:12:23,877 --> 00:12:26,377
The Mexican queso cheese
   and the kimchi

352
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:28,680
   just gives it a nice kick.

353
00:12:28,682 --> 00:12:30,181
               You say kimchi,
              my mouth waters.

354
00:12:30,183 --> 00:12:31,649
              It's like Pavlov
                and the dog.

355
00:12:31,651 --> 00:12:34,219
We'll take Napa cabbage,
  natural sea salt.

356
00:12:34,221 --> 00:12:35,620
           Pull all the moisture
                 out of it.

357
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:37,188
    That's gonna go for 24 hours
                 like this?

358
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,156
     Absolutely.

359
00:12:38,158 --> 00:12:39,524
     We have our
 rice flour slurry,

360
00:12:39,526 --> 00:12:42,327
Korean chili flakes,
chopped garlic, salted shrimp.

361
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:43,995
               And that's what
             gives it the funk.

362
00:12:43,997 --> 00:12:45,730
       Right.
Then our ginger juice.

363
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:47,599
          Grated ginger that you
             squeeze out the --
   Yeah.

364
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:50,635
Toasted sesame seeds,
carrots, green onions.

365
00:12:50,637 --> 00:12:52,604
              Then this will go
           for another 24 hours?
   Correct.

366
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:55,373
               Rub-a-dub-dub,
       we got kimchi in the tub.

367
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,242
We're gonna marinate
 the sliced rib eye.

368
00:12:57,244 --> 00:12:59,444
     Soy sauce.
I like to use pineapple juice.

369
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:01,613
It helps to break down
    the proteins.
                       Okay.

370
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:04,315
 Sugar, sesame oil,
   garlic, onions.

371
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:06,084
   Then we'll take
 our sliced rib eye.

372
00:13:06,086 --> 00:13:07,952
        Marinates 24 hours, then
   we'll put the fries together.

373
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:09,154
     Absolutely.

374
00:13:09,156 --> 00:13:10,688
We're gonna season them first
  with sesame oil.

375
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:11,890
             In a squirt bottle.

376
00:13:11,892 --> 00:13:13,291
I've never seen that in my life,
                 by the way.

377
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:14,692
  And then we have
 our seasoned salt.

378
00:13:14,694 --> 00:13:16,594
  Which is salt and a little bit
          of Korean chili flake.

379
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:18,363
Korean chili flakes.
     Absolutely.
                         Okay.

380
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:19,998
 Now that our meats
   are marinated,

381
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,833
  add a little bit
   more sesame oil

382
00:13:21,835 --> 00:13:23,301
      and then
fresh kimchi inside.

383
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,103
  -And this all comes together?
             -Right.

384
00:13:25,105 --> 00:13:27,105
    Queso sauce.
                     Hold on.

385
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:28,840
        The kimchi and the fries
                 is enough,

386
00:13:28,842 --> 00:13:31,342
           and now we're putting
      cheese sauce on top of it?
Queso, that's it.

387
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:33,545
  Which is just American cheese,
              heavy cream and?

388
00:13:33,547 --> 00:13:34,813
   Half-and-half.

389
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:37,282
Drizzle gochujang, scallions,
  and there you go.

390
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:39,350
           My friend, you've got
              a lot of issues.

391
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:40,618
       I know.
That's what my wife says.

392
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:44,022
                    Mmm.
                 It's legit.

393
00:13:44,024 --> 00:13:45,423
                  Fries are
             the perfect medium.

394
00:13:45,425 --> 00:13:47,425
                  Crunchy,
             take sauce on well.

395
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:51,596
                  But then
          you bring mega flavor.

396
00:13:51,598 --> 00:13:52,964
                     Oh.

397
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:55,733
    There is nothing more potent
  than kimchi, gochujang on top,

398
00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:58,102
            and a little bulgogi
     to go side by side with it.

399
00:13:58,104 --> 00:14:00,004
               Thank goodness
             the queso is there,

400
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:01,573
              'cause it kind of
              balances it out.

401
00:14:01,575 --> 00:14:02,974
                   I mean,
        this is powerhouse, bro.

402
00:14:02,976 --> 00:14:03,975
     Thank you.

403
00:14:03,977 --> 00:14:05,877
      Pick up kimchi fries,
             please.

404
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:07,846
       A little bit sweet,
       a little bit spicy.

405
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:09,113
    The bulgogi's
    real bulgogi.

406
00:14:09,115 --> 00:14:10,181
         No "foolgogi."

407
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:11,683
  This thing's like 20 pounds.

408
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:14,052
       I only eat it when
       I'm really hungry.

409
00:14:14,054 --> 00:14:15,954
   Have you been to this place
        here in Atlanta?

410
00:14:15,956 --> 00:14:17,522
No, but I'll come back.

411
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:19,390
       -Without question?
           -Wonderful.

412
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:22,060
  He's better than a good cook.
   I'd say he's the real deal.

413
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:24,562
             Chef, when it comes
        to making delicious food

414
00:14:24,564 --> 00:14:26,431
                 and putting
              cultures together

415
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:30,802
and keeping it right on the line
      of interesting and unique,

416
00:14:30,804 --> 00:14:31,903
             you've crushed it.

417
00:14:31,905 --> 00:14:34,239
              Congratulations.
Thank you. Appreciate it.

418
00:14:34,241 --> 00:14:36,207
Coming up
 in Richland, Washington...

419
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:37,175
      It's fun.

420
00:14:37,177 --> 00:14:39,010
 ...a cannoli/stromboli spot...

421
00:14:39,012 --> 00:14:41,246
What goes on in here
  is a flavor bomb.

422
00:14:41,248 --> 00:14:42,513
     ...where the food's...

423
00:14:42,515 --> 00:14:44,215
 You ever seen "Twilight Zone,"
       the pizza edition?

424
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:46,050
 ...almost as crazy as the chef.

425
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:49,220
   Good or bad, I will never,
     ever let you forget me.

426
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:50,989
   I guarantee it.

427
00:14:57,197 --> 00:14:59,430
               All right son,
  we're in Richland, Washington.

428
00:14:59,432 --> 00:15:01,165
          And you are gonna love
                 this place.

429
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:02,467
 Where are we going?

430
00:15:02,469 --> 00:15:04,335
          Okay, husband and wife
     are married for four years,

431
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:07,038
              divorced for 23,
             got back together,

432
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,239
       and they got a restaurant

433
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:09,941
    where they're not interested
             in making a profit.

434
00:15:09,943 --> 00:15:11,109
                They're just
              really interested

435
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:13,444
            in giving the guests
          a positive experience.

436
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:14,812
       -What do you mean?
     -I don't know, Hunter.

437
00:15:14,814 --> 00:15:16,080
          We'll have to find out
               for ourselves.

438
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:18,449
                   This is
           The Folded Pizza Pie.

439
00:15:18,451 --> 00:15:20,218
Behind you,
 Holy Moly's in the oven.

440
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,986
      We eat here at least
       three times a week.

441
00:15:21,988 --> 00:15:24,555
      The food is amazing.
           It's fresh.

442
00:15:24,557 --> 00:15:26,424
  Legacy calzone in the window.

443
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:28,426
    It's the greatest calzone
        you can ever get.

444
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:29,694
And it's one of the stars

445
00:15:29,696 --> 00:15:32,130
   of Dale and Taryn Leikam's
           second act,

446
00:15:32,132 --> 00:15:33,331
  'cause their retirement plan

447
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:36,200
       meant going all in
         at this joint.

448
00:15:36,202 --> 00:15:38,803
  -Why do two normal people --
       -We're not normal.

449
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:40,038
          I apologize.

450
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,606
 I didn't mean to offend anybody
         with that one.

451
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:43,074
            Get into
     the restaurant business

452
00:15:43,076 --> 00:15:44,742
        after they've got
   these great careers going?

453
00:15:44,744 --> 00:15:46,044
   We're not in it
 to make any money.

454
00:15:46,046 --> 00:15:47,478
      Our focus
  is on the people.

455
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,314
 You ever seen "Twilight Zone,"
       the pizza edition?

456
00:15:49,316 --> 00:15:50,882
    There you go!

457
00:15:50,884 --> 00:15:53,384
       It's a world where
  nothing's flat, only folded.

458
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:55,820
  The Folded Pie, it's a pizza
      that he just rolls up

459
00:15:55,822 --> 00:15:58,456
      into a calzone shape
      or a stromboli shape.

460
00:15:58,458 --> 00:15:59,757
Holy Moly for Carrie.

461
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,559
    The Holy Moly Stromboli,
          they pack it

462
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:04,062
 full of seven different meats,
 and it's absolutely delicious.

463
00:16:04,064 --> 00:16:06,030
We're making this gigantic
Holy Moly Stromboli?

464
00:16:06,032 --> 00:16:07,231
              We're gonna start
              with out dough --

465
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:09,767
              4 cups of water,
         salt, sugar, olive oil.

466
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:11,569
  Parmesan cheese.
             Italian seasonings.

467
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:13,104
I've never seen pizza dough
   made like this.

468
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:16,474
 That's what makes our calzones,
           strombolis stand out.

469
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:19,477
           Flour, bloomed yeast.
        Get a nice big old blob.

470
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,446
   -That's the culinary term?
     -That's our term, yeah.

471
00:16:21,448 --> 00:16:23,314
             -Blob?
   -The Folded Pizza Pie blob.

472
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:25,116
-What are we up to now, Captain?
       -Chicken meatballs.

473
00:16:25,118 --> 00:16:27,986
          So we start with 60/40
       dark meat/white meat mix.

474
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:30,388
Whoa, you get after it
with the Italian seasoning.

475
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,790
    Garlic powder, onion powder,
              salt and pepper,

476
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:35,660
 minced garlic, Cajun seasoning,
      and then our bread crumbs.

477
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:36,995
            -Got it.
         -Roll them out.

478
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:38,229
 Roast in the oven,
     what temp?

479
00:16:38,231 --> 00:16:39,998
                625 degrees.

480
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,232
       Really?
      That hot?

481
00:16:41,234 --> 00:16:42,767
   When you get that chicken fat
            coming out of there,

482
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:43,935
         it's time to pull them.

483
00:16:43,937 --> 00:16:45,937
        Okay, we're gonna do our
           oven-roasted chicken.

484
00:16:45,939 --> 00:16:47,038
  All right, boss.

485
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,606
      Add some balsamic vinegar,

486
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:51,576
            dried minced garlic,
    onion powder, garlic powder,

487
00:16:51,578 --> 00:16:53,878
              nutmeg, cinnamon,
             Italian seasoning.

488
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,946
 Italian seasoning?
         No?

489
00:16:54,948 --> 00:16:56,314
             -Yeah!
              -You?

490
00:16:56,316 --> 00:16:57,248
              Salt and pepper.

491
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,549
Marinate it for 24 hours.
                        Yep.

492
00:16:58,551 --> 00:16:59,517
Throw it in the oven.
                         Yep.

493
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,519
     What temp?
                    625 degrees.

494
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:02,754
 625 degrees again?

495
00:17:02,756 --> 00:17:04,055
             That's how we roll.

496
00:17:04,057 --> 00:17:05,656
      We know it's done when you
    start smelling the cinnamon.

497
00:17:05,658 --> 00:17:06,724
  We don't time it.

498
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:08,626
  We just wait till
we smell the cinnamon.

499
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:10,795
      So now we're going to make
        the Holy Moly Stromboli.

500
00:17:10,797 --> 00:17:14,832
So this super-herb-laden,
 Parmesan cheese dough.
                            Yep.

501
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:16,300
         Italian-seasoned dough.

502
00:17:16,302 --> 00:17:18,636
You really don't care
that a lot of your methods

503
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:20,038
and styles are unorthodox.

504
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,139
               It's my place.

505
00:17:21,141 --> 00:17:22,673
          Genoa salami.
Don't you know-a.

506
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:24,308
         Spicy sausage.

507
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,577
      You want to try some?
Oh, no. Who, us?

508
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:28,446
      Bacon, the meatballs
          we just made,

509
00:17:28,448 --> 00:17:30,181
    the oven-roasted chicken,
           pepperoni.

510
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:32,784
       And Canadian bacon.

511
00:17:32,786 --> 00:17:34,085
    You've got to
   be kidding me.

512
00:17:34,087 --> 00:17:37,522
  We have mozzarella, Fontina,
        Asiago, Parmesan,

513
00:17:37,524 --> 00:17:39,657
   Romano, cheddar, and Gouda.

514
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:41,692
       Now we roll it up,
    brush it with olive oil,

515
00:17:41,694 --> 00:17:43,861
  dust it with Parmesan cheese,
    and throw it in the oven.

516
00:17:43,863 --> 00:17:45,563
            -At 625.
              -625.

517
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:46,798
      Holy Moly Stromboli.

518
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,633
                  Would you
                look at that?

519
00:17:48,635 --> 00:17:50,001
       Put a little sauce
            on there.

520
00:17:50,003 --> 00:17:52,036
       Dip it, pour it on,
       whatever you like.

521
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:53,304
 I'll tell you what
  it's not lacking.

522
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:54,305
            -Flavor.
            -Flavor.

523
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:58,109
What goes on in here
  is a flavor bomb.

524
00:17:58,111 --> 00:17:59,844
Lots of herbs.
        The texture of the bread

525
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:01,179
     and the flavor of the bread
                is fantastic.

526
00:18:01,181 --> 00:18:03,114
       You get
this cracker crunch.

527
00:18:03,116 --> 00:18:05,049
     It's dense,
   and it's rich.

528
00:18:05,051 --> 00:18:07,652
I mean, it is not in any way,
   shape, or form

529
00:18:07,654 --> 00:18:09,687
what most people expect.

530
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:10,922
But it's really good.
             Thanks.

531
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:12,490
      Holy Moly Stromboli.

532
00:18:12,492 --> 00:18:13,491
           It's huge.

533
00:18:13,493 --> 00:18:15,093
     It's got a really good
           seasoning.

534
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:17,628
   What makes it is the crust.
  It's the reason people come.

535
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,464
Well, Dale helps
   with that, too.

536
00:18:19,466 --> 00:18:20,998
     Driving by,
he's standing outside.

537
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,300
He's like, "Come eat."

538
00:18:22,302 --> 00:18:23,901
                   He was
             flagging you down?

539
00:18:23,903 --> 00:18:25,403
You just can't keep up with him.

540
00:18:25,405 --> 00:18:27,705
Number-one rule's you get to eat
 with your elbows on the table.

541
00:18:27,707 --> 00:18:30,541
He's always making you feel more
comfortable, like you're family.

542
00:18:30,543 --> 00:18:33,344
And family dinner here
 includes a little dessert.

543
00:18:33,346 --> 00:18:34,512
Apple Doughboy.

544
00:18:34,514 --> 00:18:35,947
       The Apple Doughboy
         is really good.

545
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:38,182
    It's got the fresh apples
       with the cinnamon.

546
00:18:38,184 --> 00:18:40,718
  The special sauce on the top,
         it's delicious.

547
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,921
        Apple Doughboys.
  This was my wife's invention.

548
00:18:43,923 --> 00:18:46,757
    Granny Smith apples from
 the great state of Washington.

549
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:48,359
    -I have never seen that.
           -Seriously?

550
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:49,927
-You've never seen one of these?
             -Nope.

551
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:51,295
 -You want one in your stocking?
             -I do.

552
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:53,431
         -Yeah, please.
        -Slinky, Slinky.

553
00:18:53,433 --> 00:18:54,999
    So, some roux
  and some butter.

554
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:57,435
      Put these apples in.
    Cinnamon and the nutmeg.

555
00:18:57,437 --> 00:18:58,836
         -No measuring?
              -No.

556
00:18:58,838 --> 00:19:00,571
          -Brown sugar.
      -Where is this going?

557
00:19:00,573 --> 00:19:01,939
     We make dessert dough.

558
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:03,374
      It's just your basic
          dough recipe

559
00:19:03,376 --> 00:19:05,042
         with no cheese,
          no seasoning.

560
00:19:05,044 --> 00:19:06,210
     We didn't let it proof.

561
00:19:06,212 --> 00:19:08,646
     We just threw it right
    in the oven so it poofs.

562
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:10,314
How's it do it?
             Poofs.

563
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:11,349
                 How do you
                spell "poof"?

564
00:19:11,351 --> 00:19:15,486
         P-o-o-f-f-f...

565
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:17,054
          -Nice. Poof!
             -Poof!

566
00:19:17,056 --> 00:19:19,223
    This is the apple filling
      that we made earlier.

567
00:19:19,225 --> 00:19:21,526
      Little bit of butter,
     the cinnamon-sugar mix.

568
00:19:21,528 --> 00:19:24,028
        Ooh!
625 for -- Hunter, guess.

569
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,029
                 10 minutes.
                 12 minutes.

570
00:19:25,031 --> 00:19:26,564
              -Yes.
          -12 minutes!

571
00:19:26,566 --> 00:19:27,732
   What does this
  get served with?

572
00:19:27,734 --> 00:19:29,467
         We make our own
        cinnamon drizzle.

573
00:19:29,469 --> 00:19:31,536
   We use hard cinnamon candy
          in a hot pot.

574
00:19:31,538 --> 00:19:32,803
           Soda water.

575
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:35,606
  Now, the longer you cook it,
      the more it reduces.

576
00:19:35,608 --> 00:19:36,941
       You want me to hang
      my clothes up there?

577
00:19:36,943 --> 00:19:38,209
         No,
keep your clothes on.

578
00:19:38,211 --> 00:19:40,344
         Oh!
      It's fun.

579
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:42,547
        Apple Doughboys.

580
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:44,682
          Locally made
     vanilla bean ice cream.

581
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:45,783
So, then we're gonna pour

582
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:48,419
 this cinnamon syrup
 candy stuff on it?

583
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:50,788
              Yep.
          Bon appétit.

584
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:53,057
I have always said it
   on "Triple D."

585
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:55,493
   If it's funky,
    I'll find it.

586
00:19:55,495 --> 00:19:56,627
               This is funky.

587
00:19:56,629 --> 00:19:59,797
You might be getting
the freaky-funky award.

588
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:02,233
The Doughboy is good.

589
00:20:02,235 --> 00:20:04,135
             That is delicious.
           The glaze is awesome.

590
00:20:04,137 --> 00:20:06,871
Bro, you are on a whole
  different planet.

591
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:07,672
           Thank you.

592
00:20:07,674 --> 00:20:09,173
       Apple Doughboy up!

593
00:20:09,175 --> 00:20:11,342
  Fresh apples, the cinnamon --
           incredible.

594
00:20:11,344 --> 00:20:13,077
    Very flaky texture to it.

595
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:15,079
      And that secret sauce
   just takes it over the top.

596
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:17,181
Cinnamon glaze on my ice cream.

597
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:19,116
       Folded Pizza Pie's
   like a second home for us.

598
00:20:19,118 --> 00:20:21,118
   Dale's just a mad scientist
           back there.

599
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,521
    In closing, this is what
        I tell my guests.

600
00:20:23,523 --> 00:20:24,822
   You're wrapping
    the show up?

601
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:27,658
   Good or bad, I will never,
     ever let you forget me.

602
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,659
               That is a fact.

603
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:30,728
   I guarantee it.

604
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,230
           -Thank you.
        -And good night.

605
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:33,231
        Poof!

606
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:34,031
              Pbht!

607
00:20:35,635 --> 00:20:38,069
              Oh, interception!

608
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:40,771
   So that's it for this trip
 on "Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives,"

609
00:20:40,773 --> 00:20:41,806
      but don't you worry.

610
00:20:41,808 --> 00:20:43,608
        These young chefs
      will be taking over.

611
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:45,276
     I'll see you next week
         on "Triple D."

612
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:47,812
Just like-a your mama.

613
00:20:47,814 --> 00:20:49,146
     Where's your papa, hey?

614
00:20:49,148 --> 00:20:51,215
    Do not listen
to the crazy person.

615
00:20:51,217 --> 00:20:52,550
      You can listen to me.

616
00:20:52,552 --> 00:20:54,518
       I'm only around for
    another 10 or 15 minutes.

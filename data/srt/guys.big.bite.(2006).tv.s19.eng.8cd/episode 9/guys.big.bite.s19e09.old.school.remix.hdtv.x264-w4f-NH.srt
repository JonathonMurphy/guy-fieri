1
00:00:16,784 --> 00:00:18,684
You know, it doesn't get

2
00:00:18,686 --> 00:00:21,086
       any more old school
     than this -- meatloaf.

3
00:00:21,088 --> 00:00:23,188
     You know, I've traveled
      all over the country.

4
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,957
     I've seen meatloaf made
          with anything

5
00:00:24,959 --> 00:00:27,793
 you could imagine in more ways
     than you could imagine.

6
00:00:27,795 --> 00:00:29,328
          So I figured
      today on "Big Bite,"

7
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:31,597
 let's go old-school Americana,
          startin' off

8
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,133
    with my Andouille-stuffed
        brisket meatloaf.

9
00:00:34,135 --> 00:00:35,934
     It's got a classic look
         on the outside

10
00:00:35,936 --> 00:00:38,670
       and a flavor-packed
     Andouille sausage core.

11
00:00:38,672 --> 00:00:40,139
    This is so out of bounds.

12
00:00:40,141 --> 00:00:42,574
   Now, on the side, we've got
   smashed fingerling potatoes

13
00:00:42,576 --> 00:00:43,942
      with barbecue sauce.

14
00:00:43,944 --> 00:00:46,512
     They're crispy, spicy,
    tangy and a little sweet.

15
00:00:46,514 --> 00:00:48,280
       And I bet you can't
          eat just one.

16
00:00:48,282 --> 00:00:49,681
    Now to wash it all down,
         I'm stirrin' up

17
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:52,117
      a maple pig cocktail
         with cherries,

18
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:53,886
       whiskey and bacon.
              Yup.

19
00:00:53,888 --> 00:00:55,521
        Wait till you see
      how I make that one.

20
00:00:55,523 --> 00:00:59,691
I'm just finishing up right now,
  uh, doing the pork shoulder,

21
00:00:59,693 --> 00:01:02,294
    just a little bit of pork
 shoulder to make the Andouille.

22
00:01:02,296 --> 00:01:06,265
     Thin stripped, as cold
    as you can get that pork.

23
00:01:06,267 --> 00:01:08,834
      Listen, we're making
       fantastic meatloaf,

24
00:01:08,836 --> 00:01:11,370
        why not go ahead
     and grind it ourselves?

25
00:01:11,372 --> 00:01:13,906
    We have the attachments.
    We know we wanna do this.

26
00:01:13,908 --> 00:01:18,077
       Okay. So now taking
    the last little bit out.

27
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:19,812
 I'm just gonna leave it set up
  'cause I'm gonna be back here

28
00:01:19,814 --> 00:01:22,114
      in a second doin' it
        for the brisket.

29
00:01:22,116 --> 00:01:23,749
         Okay. We're --
 we're talkin' about Andouille,

30
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:25,884
   a famous Louisiana sausage.

31
00:01:25,886 --> 00:01:27,386
       I mean, everybody's
          got a recipe.

32
00:01:27,388 --> 00:01:29,488
      Everybody has a buddy
     that made it the best.

33
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:32,124
  So we're just gonna start off
   with a little kosher salt,

34
00:01:32,126 --> 00:01:33,325
       some black pepper.

35
00:01:33,327 --> 00:01:35,360
    We're gonna go into, uh,
        a little paprika,

36
00:01:35,362 --> 00:01:38,130
     little smoked paprika,
         sweet paprika.

37
00:01:38,132 --> 00:01:39,965
  I mean, you're just thinkin'
       about flavor city.

38
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:45,337
    We'll do a little cumin,
          just a touch.

39
00:01:45,339 --> 00:01:46,872
     A little chili powder,
          I mean, yes,

40
00:01:46,874 --> 00:01:48,874
     we are runnin' through
       the spice cabinet.

41
00:01:48,876 --> 00:01:51,477
          Just a touch
       of red chili flake.

42
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:52,744
  Just a little bit of cayenne.

43
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:54,513
      This, you can take it
    as spicy as you want it.

44
00:01:54,515 --> 00:01:56,448
         Smoked sausage,
       Andouille sausage,

45
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,184
   I mean, all those sausages
  comin' outta there, hotlinks.

46
00:01:59,186 --> 00:02:00,486
         Mm. All right.

47
00:02:00,488 --> 00:02:02,654
         Let me just get
  a little bit of garlic here.

48
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:04,289
   Now I've had bad meatloaf.

49
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:05,924
  I've had fantastic meatloaf.

50
00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:08,260
  Wait until you see the style
  of meatloaf that we're doin'.

51
00:02:08,262 --> 00:02:10,162
  I guarantee you, no one will
    walk away from the table

52
00:02:10,164 --> 00:02:11,530
        and not go, "Wow.

53
00:02:11,532 --> 00:02:12,798
          That was some
    flavor-packed meatloaf."

54
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,000
              Okay.
        So diced garlic.

55
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:19,304
     So what's gonna happen
   is I mix all this together,

56
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:20,939
      let all those flavors
         come together.

57
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:23,075
     And later, we're gonna
      form this into a log

58
00:02:23,077 --> 00:02:26,278
    and set it in the center
        of this meatloaf.

59
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,447
             I know.
I know. Just work with me. Okay.

60
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:33,018
   So I'm gonna get this down,
    let it sit in the fridge.

61
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,419
              Okay.

62
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:35,721
   Let me wash up real quick.

63
00:02:35,723 --> 00:02:37,589
  The idea was it first started

64
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:39,691
           with taking
    a whole Andouille sausage

65
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:41,560
and wrapping meatloaf around it.

66
00:02:41,562 --> 00:02:43,595
         Well, why am I
      gonna make a meatloaf

67
00:02:43,597 --> 00:02:45,230
     that I'm scratch making

68
00:02:45,232 --> 00:02:47,566
    and then put a processed
    Andouille in the middle?

69
00:02:47,568 --> 00:02:49,735
  I know how to make Andouille.
         Can't beat it.

70
00:02:49,737 --> 00:02:51,036
     Let's talk about doing
         potatoes next.

71
00:02:51,038 --> 00:02:52,704
      Fingerling potatoes,
      one of my favorites.

72
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:54,139
        When it comes to
        doin' this dish,

73
00:02:54,141 --> 00:02:55,674
    fingerlings are the key.

74
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:58,610
    And the reason is the way
  we're gonna treat 'em, okay?

75
00:02:58,612 --> 00:02:59,778
        So let's do this.

76
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:03,081
        Grab some water.
           Got a pan.

77
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,583
    You know that we're gonna
      start with cold water

78
00:03:04,585 --> 00:03:06,151
       and cold potatoes.

79
00:03:06,153 --> 00:03:07,586
          We'll drop in
     a little bit of water.

80
00:03:07,588 --> 00:03:10,956
              Okay.
   Fingerlings nice, buttery,

81
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:13,592
          thin-skinned,
     play well with others.

82
00:03:13,594 --> 00:03:14,760
   Here's what's gonna happen.

83
00:03:14,762 --> 00:03:16,361
   I'll drop the potatoes in,

84
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:19,331
    already been rinsed off,
        dried off, okay?

85
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,500
      We'll drop these in.

86
00:03:21,502 --> 00:03:22,801
       And we're gonna add
          a lotta salt.

87
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:27,005
    And I mean a lotta salt,
   like 3 tablespoons of salt.

88
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:31,476
  This is just gonna soak right
 into the potatoes as they cook.

89
00:03:31,478 --> 00:03:33,612
         And right when
     they get done cooking,

90
00:03:33,614 --> 00:03:36,081
   let 'em cool a little bit,
  and then I'm gonna smash 'em.

91
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,016
           All right.
    Let's talk about panade.

92
00:03:38,018 --> 00:03:40,619
     Okay. I make meatloaf.
        I make meatballs.

93
00:03:40,621 --> 00:03:43,121
     Panade is one of the --
  is one of the centers of it.

94
00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:44,723
       This is how you get
    all the moisture in there

95
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:45,791
    or keep all the moisture
            in there.

96
00:03:45,793 --> 00:03:47,159
          So let's just
        think about this.

97
00:03:47,161 --> 00:03:49,695
    The meatball or meatloaf
           is cooking.

98
00:03:49,697 --> 00:03:51,797
     And the fat's starting
         to render down.

99
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:53,265
              Okay?
    The fat's starting to --

100
00:03:53,267 --> 00:03:54,933
         to render down
         outta the meat.

101
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:57,102
  Well, what does it wanna do?
 It wants to leave the building.

102
00:03:57,104 --> 00:03:59,137
 It wants to end up on the tray.

103
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:00,639
        And then it wants
     to make a dry meatball.

104
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:02,474
   But if we put the panade --

105
00:04:02,476 --> 00:04:04,543
 So we're gonna take this bread
    and add a little bit of,

106
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:06,178
   uh, of egg and milk to it.

107
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,982
      If we take the panade
 and mix that in with the meat,

108
00:04:09,984 --> 00:04:12,284
    well, as the meat starts
     to render out its fat,

109
00:04:12,286 --> 00:04:15,354
   the bread soaks up the fat.
        That's my theory.

110
00:04:15,356 --> 00:04:17,289
       I'm stickin' to it.
              Okay.

111
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:19,324
     So a nice pullman loaf.

112
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:20,993
         I like to make
  my own breadcrumbs if I can.

113
00:04:20,995 --> 00:04:24,263
     So I'm just gonna pulse
       this a little bit.

114
00:04:24,265 --> 00:04:26,431
  We're gonna do some mirepoix
        here in a little.

115
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,533
      But we're just kinda
  building the layers of this.

116
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:29,801
        And not too much
          of the bread,

117
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:31,803
         this should be
       just about enough.

118
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:33,672
   And again, leftover bread,
      never throw it away.

119
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:35,907
          Keep it dry.
      Keep it from molding.

120
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:38,510
         Oh, you'll find
    something to do with it.

121
00:04:38,512 --> 00:04:40,045
            Pulse it.

122
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,182
       Yeah. There we go.

123
00:04:44,184 --> 00:04:45,784
     It was just dry enough
       that it would work.

124
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:47,319
          You can throw
        anything in here.

125
00:04:47,321 --> 00:04:49,254
         The only thing
    I try to do is stay away

126
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:51,256
     from any of the breads
     that have a real pred--

127
00:04:51,258 --> 00:04:53,125
        that have a real
       predominant flavor,

128
00:04:53,127 --> 00:04:54,893
    like a, uh, caraway seed

129
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:56,328
       or like a rye bread
          or something.

130
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:58,797
     Okay. That looks good.
       Hang on, one thing.

131
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:01,967
     Now getting into this,

132
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:05,170
    before I add that panade,

133
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:07,806
   gonna get a couple eggs...

134
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:12,377
         and some milk.

135
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:14,680
        And then I'll add
       the bread into it.

136
00:05:14,682 --> 00:05:17,249
    And the egg's gonna work
        as a great binder

137
00:05:17,251 --> 00:05:20,919
       into this meatloaf.

138
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:24,423
         And some milk.

139
00:05:24,425 --> 00:05:27,559
      Okay. Three-quarters
        of a cup of milk.

140
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:29,628
        Give that a quick
          little whisk.

141
00:05:35,803 --> 00:05:39,037
        Okay. Here we go.

142
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,407
  Beautiful, fresh breadcrumbs.

143
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:45,177
      Sourdough breadcrumbs
 would work awesome right here.

144
00:05:47,648 --> 00:05:49,381
          Fold that in.
      And again, remember,

145
00:05:49,383 --> 00:05:51,249
   just like when we're making
  meatballs, on this meatloaf,

146
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:53,151
    we don't wanna sit there
       and work it a bunch

147
00:05:53,153 --> 00:05:54,653
         and try to mix
       the egg and the --

148
00:05:54,655 --> 00:05:57,956
   and the panade all together
   with the meat all together,

149
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:00,492
    just gonna make it tough.

150
00:06:00,494 --> 00:06:02,260
              Okay.
      So the panade's done.

151
00:06:02,262 --> 00:06:03,562
       Potatoes are done.
              Okay.

152
00:06:03,564 --> 00:06:04,896
         Let's get into
       grindin' the meat.

153
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:07,132
       So let me grab, uh,
        let me see here.

154
00:06:07,134 --> 00:06:08,800
I've got --

155
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:13,572
        Here's my sirloin
         and my brisket.

156
00:06:13,574 --> 00:06:16,441
              Okay.

157
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:18,944
     Make sure that's ready.

158
00:06:18,946 --> 00:06:21,346
         So there we go,
        nice, big piece.

159
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:23,515
       Cut it in a strip.

160
00:06:23,517 --> 00:06:25,350
        Make it a little
      bit more manageable.

161
00:06:25,352 --> 00:06:26,618
    This is the brisket here.

162
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,053
      Actually, the thinner
          I can do it,

163
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:30,555
     the better, especially
    with that fat cap on top.

164
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:33,158
         Okay. Like so.

165
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,726
      And I -- like I said,
  if you have, you know, like,

166
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,428
      anytime you're trying
       to slice something,

167
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,662
         if you're gonna
        have to slice it,

168
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:39,564
       if you can have it
     a little bit a frozen,

169
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,666
   especially when it's going
   through that little mixer,

170
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:45,637
    or, you know, that blade,
it's gonna make it a lot easier.

171
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:49,374
     So here's the sirloin.

172
00:06:49,376 --> 00:06:51,076
    Okay. That gets me enough
         to get started

173
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:52,344
  'cause it takes a little bit.

174
00:06:52,346 --> 00:06:54,546
 Okay. Just throw it right on...

175
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:59,151
   Stand back. Don't have this
       aiming at anybody.

176
00:06:59,153 --> 00:07:01,286
      We drop it right in.
   So here's what's happening.

177
00:07:01,288 --> 00:07:03,989
     We're makin' old-school
     meatloaf on "Big Bite."

178
00:07:03,991 --> 00:07:05,924
           This is not
     your ordinary meatloaf.

179
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:07,692
      I'll see ya in a bit.

180
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:17,035
   Welcome back to "Big Bite."
    So I've got this meatloaf

181
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:18,937
     that we're gonna stuff
     with Andouille sausage.

182
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,172
        I've already made
         the Andouille.

183
00:07:20,174 --> 00:07:22,407
      And it's sitting down
      there in the fridge.

184
00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:23,775
        And it's gonna be
          a free-form.

185
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,277
    But we're gonna stuff it
    right in the middle of it

186
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:26,611
 just like it was a big sausage.

187
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:29,581
  So over to, uh, the mirepoix.

188
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,650
   Get a little heat on here.

189
00:07:33,854 --> 00:07:35,687
        Little olive oil.

190
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:36,988
      And I was just right
          in the middle

191
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,723
       of doing this cast
         of characters.

192
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:42,928
      So you've got this --
    onions, celery, carrots.

193
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:46,431
      Really nice and easy.
              Okay.

194
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:48,867
 Move the garlic outta the way.

195
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,703
      Okay. We'll just add
      a bit of salt to 'em

196
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:53,371
  to kinda expedite this a bit.

197
00:07:53,373 --> 00:07:55,674
     Let me just rough chop
      some garlic in here.

198
00:07:55,676 --> 00:07:58,310
              Okay.

199
00:07:58,312 --> 00:08:00,912
      Garlic's ready to go.
      We'll drop that down.

200
00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:04,282
   And I already hit a little
     bit of salt into there.

201
00:08:04,284 --> 00:08:05,517
        And like I said,
        all I'm gonna do

202
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:07,018
 is just kinda sweat 'em a bit.

203
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,887
         Now, let's look
        at the potatoes.

204
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:10,722
       Fingerling potatoes
          in the water.

205
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:13,291
   You can see the dried salt
      around the edge here.

206
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:17,028
         These should be
        just about done.

207
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:19,097
      Fork tender, perfect.

208
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:20,832
    And this is where things
      are gonna get weird.

209
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,133
           Follow me.

210
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:24,703
        Bring this over.

211
00:08:24,705 --> 00:08:28,039
         Go right here.

212
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,708
       Drain the potatoes.

213
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,109
   They're not gonna come out.
          That's fine.

214
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:32,477
   I'll put 'em back in there.

215
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,579
      But this is where it
     gets kinda interesting.

216
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:36,114
           Watch this.

217
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:38,650
      Bring the sheet tray.

218
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:43,021
     Got a little parchment
          paper there.

219
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:45,156
          I was waiting
       for this to happen.

220
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:48,159
              Okay.

221
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:51,162
      Now drop the potatoes
      on to the sheet tray.

222
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:52,230
       Nice salt in there.

223
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:53,732
      Great flavor already
         built into 'em.

224
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:55,800
   Like I said, super tender.

225
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:58,103
     Gotta kinda spread 'em
        out a little bit,

226
00:08:58,105 --> 00:08:59,404
    not too far to the edge.

227
00:08:59,406 --> 00:09:02,307
    Drop the parchment paper
         on top of 'em.

228
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:05,310
       And wait for it...

229
00:09:05,312 --> 00:09:06,945
            Exactly.

230
00:09:06,947 --> 00:09:10,048
             Now...

231
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,651
  they're gonna smash real easy

232
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:15,086
       when they're, uh...

233
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:16,988
           Voilà. Huh?

234
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:20,091
 Winner winner, chicken dinner?
 What do you think of that move?

235
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:22,394
Not the spinning the tray thing,
       but the other move.

236
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:24,596
        Isn't that cool?
    So they're nice and hot.

237
00:09:24,598 --> 00:09:27,132
        They smash easy.
  Now we'll just let 'em cool.

238
00:09:27,134 --> 00:09:29,367
     And we'll mess with 'em
     in a little bit. Okay?

239
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:31,403
      Drop those back here.

240
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,974
              Okay.

241
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:38,843
        Veggies have had
       a chance to sweat.

242
00:09:38,845 --> 00:09:41,713
    Just sweated these a bit,
      took the crunch out.

243
00:09:41,715 --> 00:09:42,914
          We'll let 'em
         just cool down.

244
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,082
        You know, I'm not
      too worried about it.

245
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,750
        We're gonna cook
    this meatloaf right now.

246
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:46,985
   So I'm not too worried that

247
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:48,987
        these hot veggies
    are gonna cook the meat.

248
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:51,389
 It kinda poaches a little bit.
 That's not gonna be the issue.

249
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:53,058
       I just don't wanna
    necessarily mix all that

250
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,326
         in with my hand

251
00:09:54,328 --> 00:09:56,161
       and have it all be
         screaming hot.

252
00:09:56,163 --> 00:09:58,463
              Okay.
         This goes here.

253
00:09:58,465 --> 00:09:59,931
         And let's bring
          the meat up.

254
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,334
 We'll get a little bit of salt,

255
00:10:02,336 --> 00:10:04,869
       some black pepper,

256
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:07,806
  a little, uh, mustard powder.
   Everybody knows this move.

257
00:10:07,808 --> 00:10:10,809
    Their mom used to do it,
     half a cup of ketchup.

258
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:13,111
      Now, I make a variety
       of barbecue sauces.

259
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:17,115
      So this is my bourbon
   brown sugar barbecue sauce.

260
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,950
  That was too bad, wasn't it?

261
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:21,019
       A little hot sauce,
    whatever your favorite is

262
00:10:21,021 --> 00:10:24,789
   and depending how spicy you
        wanna make this,

263
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:27,492
          and a little
    Worcestershire of course.

264
00:10:27,494 --> 00:10:31,463
     That's the right size.
              Okay.

265
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:33,531
       Gonna mix the meat
         up real quick.

266
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,571
        Little bit there.
   Shouldn't start mixin' yet.

267
00:10:39,573 --> 00:10:45,110
   We'll drop in the mirepoix
        with the garlic.

268
00:10:45,112 --> 00:10:48,747
       That's had a chance
   to cool down a little bit.

269
00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:51,883
              Okay.

270
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:54,552
      Now we get the panade
         with the milk,

271
00:10:54,554 --> 00:10:56,721
        the couple eggs.

272
00:10:56,723 --> 00:11:00,725
 And the idea is to mix this up
      as little as possible

273
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:03,294
         and get it done
      as quick as possible,

274
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:05,063
   um, so we don't beat it up
       and make it all --

275
00:11:05,065 --> 00:11:07,899
           all tough.
              Okay.

276
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:09,534
      Look at that, though.

277
00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:11,936
        All that flavor.

278
00:11:11,938 --> 00:11:13,571
  Mix it as little as possible.

279
00:11:13,573 --> 00:11:16,374
      Have everything done.
          There we go.

280
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:18,810
    I think that looks good.
  We'll see what it looks like

281
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:21,513
         when we dump it
     out here onto the foil.

282
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:28,920
  Get it all, little bit more.

283
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:30,455
 And this is a lot of meatloaf.

284
00:11:30,457 --> 00:11:32,557
    Don't worry, you'll have
      leftovers with this.

285
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:33,758
        Wait till you see
       how we present it.

286
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,127
     It's gonna be so cool.
              Okay.

287
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:38,897
     So now, kinda layin' it

288
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:40,965
       out here like this,

289
00:11:40,967 --> 00:11:45,904
      kinda forming this up
         to a rectangle.

290
00:11:45,906 --> 00:11:48,206
          Got all that
       seasoning in there.

291
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:51,309
     Okay. Give me a second.

292
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:53,211
        That's why I have
        the foot pedals.

293
00:11:58,185 --> 00:12:01,419
     Wash my hands more time
    in this one little piece.

294
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:06,191
   Now we grab the Andouille.

295
00:12:06,193 --> 00:12:07,559
              Okay.

296
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:08,993
          Look at this.

297
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:11,730
        Gonna take this,

298
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:14,499
  kinda roll it into a sausage.

299
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:16,801
       You got everything,
 smoked paprika, sweet paprika,

300
00:12:16,803 --> 00:12:18,970
      cumin, chili powder,
        red chili flake,

301
00:12:18,972 --> 00:12:21,106
        a little cayenne
       all mixed in there.

302
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:23,975
 Okay. So now what I'm gonna do

303
00:12:23,977 --> 00:12:28,546
       is just kinda bring
    this over halfway there.

304
00:12:28,548 --> 00:12:31,616
    Bring this over halfway.

305
00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:32,984
        Okay, like that.

306
00:12:32,986 --> 00:12:36,020
     See how we're startin'
     to form that together?

307
00:12:36,022 --> 00:12:37,522
         You pickin' up
      what I'm layin' down?

308
00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:39,457
          Oh, exactly.
      Stuffed inside of it.

309
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:40,859
        We're gonna cook
       the whole thing up.

310
00:12:40,861 --> 00:12:46,331
   So take this, roll it over,
      continue to roll it.

311
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:47,699
          There we go.

312
00:12:47,701 --> 00:12:51,236
     Okay, we're gonna twist
   this end up nice and tight,

313
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:54,239
        twist this end up
         nice and tight.

314
00:12:54,241 --> 00:12:56,441
        Huh? Right there?

315
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:58,009
     On the seam -- Right --

316
00:12:58,011 --> 00:13:00,979
  It looks like one big, round,
        stuffed meatloaf.

317
00:13:00,981 --> 00:13:03,782
   Into the oven, 350 degrees.
    We'll take it out later,

318
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:05,617
        out of the foil,
          crisp it up.

319
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:06,851
      You're gonna love it.
       I got a lot to do.

320
00:13:06,853 --> 00:13:08,153
     I'll see you in a bit.

321
00:13:17,531 --> 00:13:18,897
   Welcome back to "Big Bite."

322
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:21,099
    Yes, I am canning bacon.
          No, I'm not.

323
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:24,169
       I'm actually making
     some fantastic whiskey

324
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:26,070
       with a little thing
       we call a fat wash.

325
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:28,039
          So I rendered
        down some bacon.

326
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:31,643
   I've got some whiskey here,
     gonna dump it right in.

327
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:35,180
    Let this whiskey take on
all this fantastic bacon flavor.

328
00:13:35,182 --> 00:13:38,116
   And then to -- well, to --
    to get the fat out of it

329
00:13:38,118 --> 00:13:40,185
    that I'm imparting flavor
         with right now,

330
00:13:40,187 --> 00:13:41,486
      I'm gonna freeze it.

331
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,321
         Gonna freeze it
  and then I'm gonna strain it.

332
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:46,524
   And all that comes together
 to make a little bacon whiskey.

333
00:13:46,526 --> 00:13:47,859
              Okay.
       So we got all kinds

334
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:49,794
        of homemade goods
      goin' on around here.

335
00:13:49,796 --> 00:13:50,962
   And one of 'em is meatloaf.

336
00:13:50,964 --> 00:13:53,464
        Let me throw this
         in the freezer.

337
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:54,766
     One of 'em is meatloaf.

338
00:13:54,768 --> 00:13:58,102
       And it's comin' out
     of the oven right now.

339
00:13:58,104 --> 00:14:01,973
          Take a look.
 Stuffed with Andouille sausage.

340
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:03,741
  Did all the grinding myself.

341
00:14:03,743 --> 00:14:06,077
      Now what I'm gonna do
      is just open this up,

342
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,612
         throw a little
      barbecue sauce on it

343
00:14:07,614 --> 00:14:09,047
  and pop it back in the oven.

344
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:10,782
 So it should be extremely hot.

345
00:14:10,784 --> 00:14:12,717
       That's always fun.

346
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,557
          There ya go.
 That's what I'm talkin' about.

347
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:22,560
    Now the great thing is is
  by locking it into the foil,

348
00:14:22,562 --> 00:14:24,462
   by keeping it in the foil,
         I had a chance

349
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:27,699
   to really lock all the fat
      and flavor in there.

350
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:30,134
  So as it cooked and the fat's
  trying to leave the building,

351
00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:31,870
   all that panade grabbed it.

352
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:35,807
      Now I'm just gettin'
     a little barbecue sauce

353
00:14:35,809 --> 00:14:38,977
      right on top of that.

354
00:14:38,979 --> 00:14:41,846
          There we go.
       Grab this bad boy.

355
00:14:41,848 --> 00:14:44,849
  Back in the oven -- oven for
    about another 30 minutes.

356
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:46,484
     Then we're good to go.

357
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,322
          350 degrees.

358
00:14:51,324 --> 00:14:54,025
     Now, I've got some oil
   workin' over here already.

359
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:55,960
           Making sure
         that's at 350.

360
00:14:55,962 --> 00:14:57,962
     I cooked these potatoes
     in a little saltwater,

361
00:14:57,964 --> 00:14:59,464
    actually heavy saltwater.

362
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:02,934
       And now I take 'em,
  just start droppin' 'em down.

363
00:15:02,936 --> 00:15:04,102
          There we go.

364
00:15:04,104 --> 00:15:05,670
          We use these
      fingerling potatoes.

365
00:15:05,672 --> 00:15:07,005
      So we'll load that up
          a little bit.

366
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,640
     And then we're gonna do
   this great barbecue sauce.

367
00:15:08,642 --> 00:15:12,010
  I don't wanna overload this.
          There we go.

368
00:15:12,012 --> 00:15:13,645
         You can't just
        do a French fry.

369
00:15:13,647 --> 00:15:15,380
          You can't do
     a boring baked potato.

370
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:16,848
         You can't just
       do mashed potatoes,

371
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:19,651
   not with a meatloaf that's
 stuffed with Andouille sausage.

372
00:15:19,653 --> 00:15:20,985
         Have to go big.

373
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:23,087
  And since we're in the theme
        of grinding meats

374
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:25,490
     and doing scratch-made
          ingredients,

375
00:15:25,492 --> 00:15:26,891
  why not make our own bourbon,

376
00:15:26,893 --> 00:15:29,494
    apply a little bacon fat
           and bacon,

377
00:15:29,496 --> 00:15:31,029
       and make a cocktail
           out of it?

378
00:15:31,031 --> 00:15:32,730
     It's the holy trinity.

379
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:34,432
      Now I'm gonna make --

380
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:35,967
       Of course, I've got
     my own barbecue sauce,

381
00:15:35,969 --> 00:15:37,702
       my own wing sauce,
     a few of these things.

382
00:15:37,704 --> 00:15:39,604
   But I'm gonna make a little
      fortified sauce here

383
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:41,306
  that's gonna go with these --

384
00:15:41,308 --> 00:15:43,975
   with these, uh, twice-fried
    or twice-cooked potatoes.

385
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:46,644
  So a little of my wing sauce.

386
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:50,949
 Of course, a little hot sauce.

387
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:55,253
         Let's see here.
          There we go.

388
00:15:55,255 --> 00:15:59,023
         A little agave
        to sweeten it up.

389
00:15:59,025 --> 00:16:03,294
    And a little more vinegar
      coming for some ACB,

390
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,830
    some apple cider vinegar.

391
00:16:08,068 --> 00:16:09,534
     And last but not least,

392
00:16:09,536 --> 00:16:11,035
     you know I'm not gonna
   make anything that's spicy

393
00:16:11,037 --> 00:16:14,405
      that's not gonna have
       a little Sriracha.

394
00:16:14,407 --> 00:16:15,540
          There we go.

395
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:17,041
      So you got the sweet.
        You got the heat.

396
00:16:17,043 --> 00:16:19,711
      You got the Guy Fieri
           wing sauce.

397
00:16:19,713 --> 00:16:22,413
       All that together,

398
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:25,683
      don't need to cook it
          or anything.

399
00:16:25,685 --> 00:16:26,985
  And it'll keep in the fridge.
           All right.

400
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:28,653
       Potatoes are down.
     Meatloaf is finishin'.

401
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:30,855
   We got a cocktail to make.
  I gotta freeze some bourbon.

402
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:33,825
           Come back.
     You're gonna love this.

403
00:16:36,396 --> 00:16:37,729
   Welcome back to "Big Bite."

404
00:16:37,731 --> 00:16:40,164
       Yes, making my own
         bacon bourbon.

405
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,033
   What I did is I cooked down
           some bacon,

406
00:16:42,035 --> 00:16:44,402
    took the fat, the bacon,
      everything with some,

407
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:46,804
   uh, whiskey, let it set up,

408
00:16:46,806 --> 00:16:48,639
          strained it,
         then froze it,

409
00:16:48,641 --> 00:16:51,142
got the fat to float to the top.
      Now I'm straining it.

410
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:52,610
 And this, ladies and gentlemen,

411
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:55,546
 is making bacon bourbon, okay?

412
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:56,781
         We'll let that
        rest right there.

413
00:16:56,783 --> 00:16:59,350
  Let's make a cocktail. Okay?

414
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:03,521
          Now, a little
      maraschino cherries,

415
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:05,590
      the good kind, okay?

416
00:17:05,592 --> 00:17:07,091
    You know there's the ones
        that are glowing.

417
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:11,896
 I don't like to use those kind.
      So a couple of those.

418
00:17:11,898 --> 00:17:15,967
        Get a little bit
   of bitters here, little --

419
00:17:15,969 --> 00:17:17,568
      little bacon bitters,
           we call it.

420
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,270
          If you don't,
just regular bitters'll be fine.

421
00:17:19,272 --> 00:17:22,440
     But since we're in that
bacon theme, little maple syrup.

422
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:26,544
 This is the maple pig cocktail.

423
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:29,313
          There we go.

424
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:32,784
   Touch of some lemon juice.

425
00:17:32,786 --> 00:17:34,285
          There we go.

426
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:37,822
              Okay.

427
00:17:37,824 --> 00:17:40,558
        A few ice cubes.

428
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,860
   Give this a little muddle,

429
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:46,898
break those cherries down a bit.

430
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,232
       Now we'll pour one.

431
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:49,600
       I know this is not
     the conventional thing

432
00:17:49,602 --> 00:17:51,369
        to pour it in --
         pour it out of.

433
00:17:51,371 --> 00:17:54,739
   But, uh, throw a little bit
    of that bacon bourbon in.

434
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:59,811
      Give it a little stir
  as to not bruise the bourbon.

435
00:17:59,813 --> 00:18:02,280
              Okay.

436
00:18:02,282 --> 00:18:04,615
           Here we go,
       right over the top.

437
00:18:07,053 --> 00:18:09,787
      Beautiful with those
        muddled cherries.

438
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:12,190
        Give it a little
     squeeze of some lemon.

439
00:18:12,192 --> 00:18:14,659
             And...

440
00:18:14,661 --> 00:18:16,694
   oh, we're off to the races.

441
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:18,429
      I'm tellin' you this,

442
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:22,567
 the bacon flavor is so intense.

443
00:18:22,569 --> 00:18:25,203
        With the cherries
    and the bacon, fantastic.

444
00:18:25,205 --> 00:18:28,005
     All right. So I've got
    some fingerling potatoes

445
00:18:28,007 --> 00:18:30,541
          that are just
       finishing on a fry.

446
00:18:30,543 --> 00:18:32,677
 I've got a barbecue sauce that
  I'm gonna toss these in that

447
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:34,512
         are just going
       to rock your world.

448
00:18:34,514 --> 00:18:36,481
  I'm tellin' you, this is kind
     of like the best of --

449
00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:37,715
      of, uh, baked potato,

450
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:39,317
          fried potato,
         skillet potato,

451
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:42,320
    French fries all at once.

452
00:18:42,322 --> 00:18:45,790
       So we'll take that.

453
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:48,826
        Pop the potatoes
       right in the bowl.

454
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:51,395
     Now, the barbecue sauce
   I made with some Sriracha,

455
00:18:51,397 --> 00:18:53,631
         a little agave,
           wing sauce,

456
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:57,201
           hot sauce,
      all coming together.

457
00:18:57,203 --> 00:18:59,604
   And that's right over here.

458
00:18:59,606 --> 00:19:02,140
       And a little sweet,
     I hit a little bit of,

459
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:04,075
    uh, agave in there to --

460
00:19:04,077 --> 00:19:05,576
   to make it nice and sweet.

461
00:19:05,578 --> 00:19:07,578
        Pour some of this
          over the top.

462
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:13,184
        Give that a quick
          little toss.

463
00:19:13,186 --> 00:19:15,186
            Oh, yeah.
         Tons of flavor.

464
00:19:15,188 --> 00:19:18,055
    This is kind of like, uh,
  Vegas fries at my restaurant

465
00:19:18,057 --> 00:19:20,992
    but just in a little bit
         different form.

466
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:23,861
     Get a few of these out
     with some of the sauce.

467
00:19:23,863 --> 00:19:25,997
 You'll wanna make that sauce on
 the side, make a little extra.

468
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:28,432
    It'll keep in the fridge.
              Okay.

469
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:29,800
         Now to the star
          of the show.

470
00:19:29,802 --> 00:19:31,235
         It all started
       about the meatloaf.

471
00:19:31,237 --> 00:19:32,970
       I was sayin', "How
do you make fantastic meatloaf?"

472
00:19:32,972 --> 00:19:35,239
   I've had meatloaf a million
        definitely ways.

473
00:19:35,241 --> 00:19:36,941
      What I did is first,
    I made Andouille sausage.

474
00:19:36,943 --> 00:19:39,677
    I ground my own pork, uh,
       did all the spices,

475
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,045
 smoked paprika, sweet paprika,

476
00:19:41,047 --> 00:19:42,613
      cumin, chili powder,
        red pepper flake.

477
00:19:42,615 --> 00:19:44,048
          You name it.
     Everybody was in there.

478
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,384
Let that come together with some
  great flavor and some garlic.

479
00:19:46,386 --> 00:19:50,021
          Then I ground
   my own sirloin and brisket.

480
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:52,924
  And I just want you to see...
         Nice and easy.

481
00:19:52,926 --> 00:19:54,225
      Still nice and warm.

482
00:19:54,227 --> 00:19:56,294
        Stuffed it inside
         of this brisket

483
00:19:56,296 --> 00:19:59,330
      and sirloin meatloaf
        with this panade.

484
00:19:59,332 --> 00:20:01,899
        And tell me that
     doesn't look dynamite.

485
00:20:01,901 --> 00:20:05,469
     And it's nice and light
   and tender and falls apart.

486
00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:08,806
    That's what we're lookin'
        for right there.

487
00:20:08,808 --> 00:20:10,908
               Mm.

488
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,877
   I mean, if you're gonna go
     to the point and eat --

489
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:14,779
   If you're eatin' meatloaf,
 if this is what's on the menu,

490
00:20:14,781 --> 00:20:17,615
 then it should look like this.

491
00:20:17,617 --> 00:20:19,250
    And I know how much fat,
       and I know exactly

492
00:20:19,252 --> 00:20:21,419
       what I put in there
        'cause I made it.

493
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:26,857
      It's sweet and tender
         on the outside.

494
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:29,060
       As soon as you get
         in the middle,

495
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:31,963
      that Andouille's got
         tons of spice.

496
00:20:31,965 --> 00:20:33,564
  It's a little bit more firm.

497
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:36,334
        Got some mirepoix
        and some garlic.

498
00:20:36,336 --> 00:20:40,471
    And that panade holds it
          all together.

499
00:20:40,473 --> 00:20:43,574
              Mmm.
   That's how you do meatloaf.

500
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:47,111
  You know you want the recipe,
  foodnetwork.com/guysbigbite.

501
00:20:47,113 --> 00:20:49,447
        You'll love this.
  When you're out at the ranch,

502
00:20:49,449 --> 00:20:50,681
        this is what you
          should eat --

503
00:20:50,683 --> 00:20:51,983
        this is what you
        should be eating,

504
00:20:51,985 --> 00:20:53,584
         that along with
     a little bacon bourbon.

505
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:55,253
        See ya next week.

506
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:57,188
         That is killer.

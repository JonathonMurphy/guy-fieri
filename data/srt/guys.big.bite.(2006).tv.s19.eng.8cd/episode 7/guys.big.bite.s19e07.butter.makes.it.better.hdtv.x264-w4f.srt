1
00:00:15,716 --> 00:00:17,483
      So earlier this year,

2
00:00:17,485 --> 00:00:20,519
    Lori and I and my parents
 had this awesome trip to Cuba.

3
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:22,721
          Oh, that Cuban trip,
         I wanna go back so bad.

4
00:00:22,723 --> 00:00:24,957
Yeah. We just got back, and she
   already wants to go back.

5
00:00:24,959 --> 00:00:26,892
     But anyhow, we ate
at these awesome restaurants.

6
00:00:26,894 --> 00:00:28,293
We had fantastic dishes.

7
00:00:28,295 --> 00:00:29,895
  But there's one place
that she didn't get to go

8
00:00:29,897 --> 00:00:32,464
where they made an old-school
    dish she's gotta try.

9
00:00:32,466 --> 00:00:33,966
I know she'll love it.
     So I figured,

10
00:00:33,968 --> 00:00:35,200
let's do it on "Big Bite,"

11
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:37,002
    starting off
with my chicken Kiev.

12
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:39,872
 We've got crispy, fried ground
   chicken filled with a dill

13
00:00:39,874 --> 00:00:41,874
       and smoked paprika
        compound butter.

14
00:00:41,876 --> 00:00:43,575
           It's crispy
      on the outside, juicy

15
00:00:43,577 --> 00:00:45,944
          and literally
      flavor-packed inside.

16
00:00:45,946 --> 00:00:47,446
         To cut through
       all that richness,

17
00:00:47,448 --> 00:00:49,948
      how about a zucchini
     and fennel noodle salad

18
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,618
    tossed in a bright lemon
vinaigrette with pecorino cheese

19
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:53,986
     and crispy prosciutto.

20
00:00:53,988 --> 00:00:55,387
    And to wash it all down,

21
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:58,123
         I'm shakin' up
  a Blackberry Mule with vodka,

22
00:00:58,125 --> 00:00:59,391
      lime and ginger beer

23
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:01,927
     that might just go down
       a little too easy.

24
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:05,798
  Let's talk about, uh, making
   the stuffing for the Kiev.

25
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,600
        Now, uh, Kiev is
     actually a French dish.

26
00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:11,103
        Sounds very, uh,
      sounds Russian to me.

27
00:01:11,105 --> 00:01:12,971
        For some reason,
I always thought it was Russian.

28
00:01:12,973 --> 00:01:14,073
    I think the French stole it.

29
00:01:14,075 --> 00:01:15,340
           And then the Russians
               took it back.

30
00:01:15,342 --> 00:01:16,809
Is that what it is?
 Well, we tried it

31
00:01:16,811 --> 00:01:18,544
at a Soviet restaurant in Cuba.

32
00:01:18,546 --> 00:01:20,913
    And I'm not kiddin' you.
      This place was legit.

33
00:01:20,915 --> 00:01:22,214
       And I've never seen
       Kiev done this way.

34
00:01:22,216 --> 00:01:24,550
   I always thought it was
the chicken breast stuffed...

35
00:01:24,552 --> 00:01:26,552
            -Pounded.
   -Pounded out a little bit,

36
00:01:26,554 --> 00:01:28,020
then breaded, then fried.

37
00:01:28,022 --> 00:01:29,154
Well, this right here,

38
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:30,456
we're gonna be grinding
   our own chicken.

39
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:31,723
We're in for a blast.
      Trust me.

40
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:33,258
Um, you're good with that.

41
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,160
   Can I get about
a quarter cup of, uh,

42
00:01:35,162 --> 00:01:36,995
the Pepper Jack cheese?

43
00:01:36,997 --> 00:01:40,032
  Okay, so we'll start with
some butter, a lotta butter.

44
00:01:40,034 --> 00:01:44,236
 We're gonna take this butter,
mix it with these ingredients.

45
00:01:44,238 --> 00:01:47,706
    We got dill.
Yeah. Right in there.

46
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:51,877
Throw a little bit
of smashed garlic.

47
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:54,413
       There we go.
So the Pepper Jack cheese,

48
00:01:54,415 --> 00:01:58,617
     the butter,
little bit of garlic.

49
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,385
          That's a lotta garlic.

50
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:02,254
That's not a lotta garlic.
  It's just a little bit.

51
00:02:02,256 --> 00:02:03,922
  Who ever comments about
too much garlic in their --

52
00:02:03,924 --> 00:02:05,457
          -Yes, it is.
              -Huh?

53
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:07,359
       Who doesn't like garlic?
You didn't just say that.

54
00:02:07,361 --> 00:02:08,861
     All right.
Little cream cheese.

55
00:02:08,863 --> 00:02:10,929
 But you listen.
So we go to Cuba.

56
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:12,498
  And it was really
just at the beginning

57
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,733
    when people were having
the opportunity to go to Cuba.

58
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:17,436
       Lori and my mom
and dad flew in ahead of me.

59
00:02:17,438 --> 00:02:20,205
I was coming in from Texas.
    And they get there.

60
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:22,141
 They had a real tough time,
well, not a real tough time.

61
00:02:22,143 --> 00:02:24,176
But they had an interesting time
     coming through customs.

62
00:02:24,178 --> 00:02:25,978
Me, I just breezed
  right through.

63
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,814
But, boy, was it a blast
       or what?
                       Oh, yeah.

64
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:30,849
     But your father, I thought
    they were gonna lock him up.

65
00:02:30,851 --> 00:02:32,284
Well, they probably
should lock him up.

66
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:35,354
    Anyways, uh,
so some cream cheese.

67
00:02:35,356 --> 00:02:36,889
          -Don't help.
           -Oh, okay.

68
00:02:36,891 --> 00:02:38,457
  Just stand over
there and watch me.

69
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:41,293
      -Want a back scratch?
       -No. Mom, come on.

70
00:02:41,295 --> 00:02:43,028
    Would you chop up
a little bit of parsley?

71
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,430
   I gotta kinda pulse this
a little bit, get this started.

72
00:02:45,432 --> 00:02:46,865
   Okay. So this is
gonna be the stuffing.

73
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:48,834
    Now, believe it or not,
we're gonna take this stuffing

74
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:51,136
 and freeze it before
we put it into the, uh,

75
00:02:51,138 --> 00:02:53,038
before we put it
into the chicken.

76
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:58,110
  This always happens when
I put cream cheese in there.

77
00:02:58,112 --> 00:03:00,946
Okay. So wad that down in.

78
00:03:00,948 --> 00:03:02,281
       So yeah.
We go -- we get there.

79
00:03:02,283 --> 00:03:04,149
We were there for about 5 days.
        We did it all.

80
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:05,851
   We toured all
throughout Havana.

81
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:07,553
   Then, we went
outside of Havana,

82
00:03:07,555 --> 00:03:09,488
went to a Cuban cigar factory.

83
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:10,689
That was outrageous.

84
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:13,358
Just really nice people,
    really cool cars.

85
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,527
I didn't believe that the car
  thing was true, did you?

86
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,529
                            No.
That they were actually gonna be
   drivin' those cars around?

87
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:20,732
And if you saw a car that wasn't
  an old car, you stared at it.

88
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:21,833
                But the old cars
                were everywhere.

89
00:03:21,835 --> 00:03:23,569
              So after a while,
             it was no big deal.

90
00:03:23,571 --> 00:03:26,572
      Yeah. It wasn't.
Go ahead and drop it in, Mom.

91
00:03:26,574 --> 00:03:29,741
Okay. Little smoked paprika.

92
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:31,510
There we go.

93
00:03:31,512 --> 00:03:33,979
Little salt and pepper.

94
00:03:33,981 --> 00:03:36,181
 And I'm just fighting to
get this to start to work.

95
00:03:36,183 --> 00:03:38,650
 If you can let the cream cheese
  sit out a bit or the butter,

96
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:40,319
    go ahead and, uh, and do it.

97
00:03:40,321 --> 00:03:43,021
    It won't make it so tough
     to get this to mix up.

98
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:45,524
     All right.
Give it one more try.

99
00:03:45,526 --> 00:03:46,858
     -I've done this before.
            -I know.

100
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,794
I know it's not appearing --

101
00:03:48,796 --> 00:03:51,063
Nothing worse than have your mom
  watching over your shoulder.

102
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:53,131
       "Uh, real good.
Great job on the show, Guy."

103
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:54,600
Okay. Here we go.

104
00:03:54,602 --> 00:03:56,134
     The compound butter --

105
00:03:56,136 --> 00:03:58,403
     Well, we should call it
      compound butter plus.

106
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:00,672
         Had the butter.
        Had cream cheese.

107
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:02,941
         It had, uh, uh,
     the Pepper Jack cheese,

108
00:04:02,943 --> 00:04:05,310
     little smoked paprika,
        had some garlic,

109
00:04:05,312 --> 00:04:08,113
         little parsley,
    a little salt and pepper.

110
00:04:08,115 --> 00:04:10,983
      And to round it out,
 which this place was known for,

111
00:04:10,985 --> 00:04:12,918
Okay. So what we'll do,

112
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,721
    take a little bit
of this compound butter.

113
00:04:15,723 --> 00:04:18,423
Lay it right here in the center.

114
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:19,758
We're gonna freeze this, Mom.

115
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,094
We're gonna freeze it
  real tight. Okay?

116
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:24,396
We're gonna freeze it so,
 when we drop it inside,

117
00:04:24,398 --> 00:04:26,098
  we're gonna get some ground
chicken here in just a second.

118
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,967
 But we'll freeze this so tight
 that, when we drop it in there,

119
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:32,137
   it's almost gonna be like
a butter-cream cheese Popsicle.

120
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:34,072
Okay?

121
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:36,708
Lay that down.

122
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,677
           Want me to wrap that?
 No. I got it.

123
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:41,179
Why? Just 'cause I couldn't
     use my own mixer,

124
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:44,182
  you think that, now, that's
the way everything's gonna be?

125
00:04:44,184 --> 00:04:46,585
Roll that over.

126
00:04:46,587 --> 00:04:48,820
      Here we go.
Give it a little spin.

127
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:50,889
There we go. Okay.

128
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:53,292
And the key to this is, drop --
 gotta drop it in the freezer.

129
00:04:53,294 --> 00:04:54,760
Okay?

130
00:04:54,762 --> 00:04:58,563
Right down here in the freezer.
    Out comes the chicken.

131
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:02,034
 So what I did here, Mom,
you got breasts and thighs.

132
00:05:02,036 --> 00:05:03,502
     Cubed them up,
threw 'em in the freezer

133
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:05,203
and just put a little bit
   of a freeze on 'em.

134
00:05:05,205 --> 00:05:07,139
You know like when you're trying
 to slice something really thin?

135
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:08,874
  -If it's a tiny bit frozen...
             -Right.

136
00:05:08,876 --> 00:05:10,642
  ...it just works
a little bit easier.

137
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:13,512
Would you grab me that other
     carafe right there

138
00:05:13,514 --> 00:05:14,780
for the food processor?

139
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:16,381
Right there.

140
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:17,783
So you could get
 ground chicken.

141
00:05:17,785 --> 00:05:19,184
But if by chance you can't,

142
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:21,286
and you wanna make this dish,
  this is the way to do it.

143
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:23,121
You put a little bit extra --

144
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:25,290
you put a little bit
 extra time into it.

145
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:27,159
      Cut it up.
Freeze it a little bit.

146
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:28,660
     And we'll be able
to process it through here.

147
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,529
So --
               Is this better
             than buying ground?

148
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:32,531
   Well, here's the thing
you know is you know exactly

149
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:33,899
what your ratio's gonna be.
                         Uh-huh.

150
00:05:33,901 --> 00:05:36,501
So here we've got equal parts
     of breast and thigh

151
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:38,103
or maybe two-thirds,
     one-third.

152
00:05:38,105 --> 00:05:41,273
Don't overload it.
 Pop it like that.

153
00:05:41,275 --> 00:05:43,175
   Sometimes, it's
a little too frozen.

154
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:44,409
 So if you have
to let it sit out

155
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:46,878
in a little room temperature,
    just kinda pulse it.

156
00:05:51,585 --> 00:05:52,918
Let's take a look at that.

157
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,053
So you see what you get?
                         Uh-huh.

158
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:56,588
 Nice little --
nice, ground up.

159
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,090
  You know, how much
fat you have in there,

160
00:05:58,092 --> 00:05:59,691
how much breast,
 how much thigh.

161
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,560
            Yeah. It looks good.
Fantastic. Okay.

162
00:06:01,562 --> 00:06:05,297
So we take that out.
  We knock it over.

163
00:06:05,299 --> 00:06:06,898
And we continue the process.

164
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,500
You ready?
                          Yep.

165
00:06:08,502 --> 00:06:10,502
Okay, good, 'cause I gotta go
     check some e-mail.

166
00:06:10,504 --> 00:06:12,104
- Okay.
    -No?

167
00:06:12,106 --> 00:06:14,539
          -Yeah, sure.
     -I'll take care of it.

168
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:17,242
          All right.
So this gets dropped in. Okay.

169
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:19,344
  Well, let's do this.
We'll put this together.

170
00:06:19,346 --> 00:06:20,979
    When you come back,
we're making chicken Kiev.

171
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:22,581
Got a fantastic cocktail.

172
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:23,882
 And one of my mom's
favorite vegetables,

173
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:25,050
      the zucchini,
will be coming into play.

174
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:26,284
We'll see you in a little bit.

175
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:32,724
                 Welcome back.
               "Guy's Big Bite."

176
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,059
    Uh, cooking here in the, uh,

177
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:35,460
            at the ranch kitchen
                with my mom.

178
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:37,729
       What are you looking for?
Don't worry about it.

179
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,097
Go ahead.

180
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:40,432
         "Don't worry about it."

181
00:06:40,434 --> 00:06:41,967
           You see how we've got
           the stations swapped

182
00:06:41,969 --> 00:06:43,402
        'cause I'm over here
     workin' with the mandoline.

183
00:06:43,404 --> 00:06:44,770
  But this is gonna be some, uh,

184
00:06:44,772 --> 00:06:47,305
        dynamite zucchini strips
             for this salad.

185
00:06:47,307 --> 00:06:48,907
         It's gonna get a little
           prosciutto into it.

186
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:51,476
    My mom is, uh, setting up
the dredging station over there.

187
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:53,612
     How are we doing, Penelope?
Doing great.

188
00:06:53,614 --> 00:06:55,447
           Let me just get this.

189
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:57,015
        -These our eggs?
           -Uh, yeah.

190
00:06:57,017 --> 00:06:59,351
             Our eggs.
  We have, uh, organic chickens.

191
00:06:59,353 --> 00:07:01,319
            So our garden,
      what happens is, you know,

192
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:02,788
            sometimes, you don't
               get out there.

193
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:05,056
      And the tomato was fine
   yesterday. Then you come out.

194
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:06,291
            Now, it's laying out
                on the ground

195
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:07,659
    and it's a little bit mushy.

196
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:09,561
          Well, we take those,
         throw 'em over the, uh,

197
00:07:09,563 --> 00:07:11,763
        throw 'em over the fence
            to the chickens.

198
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:13,632
And the chickens get to eat 'em.
       And I wanna talk --

199
00:07:13,634 --> 00:07:15,700
          you wanna talk about
         beautiful organic eggs.

200
00:07:15,702 --> 00:07:17,035
    I've talked about it before.

201
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:18,637
        I don't know if you know
         the story about Ryder.

202
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,071
               So one time,
          we didn't have chick--

203
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:21,773
         we didn't have eggs.
       We came back from a trip.

204
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,575
            And none of the eggs
            were waiting for us.

205
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:26,344
        And, uh, so we got some
       organic eggs at the store

206
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:27,746
         and made 'em for Ryder.

207
00:07:27,748 --> 00:07:29,347
            And, uh, Ryder looks
              at 'em and says,

208
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:30,982
       "I'm not eatin' those.
    Something's wrong with 'em."

209
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:32,250
           'Cause they were just
            a beautiful yellow.

210
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:33,885
               They weren't that
                 big golden...

211
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,320
             -Right.
          -That orange.

212
00:07:35,322 --> 00:07:36,521
         Uh, it was crazy. Okay.

213
00:07:36,523 --> 00:07:38,690
                 Um, so my mom's
                  workin' that.

214
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:40,125
    Whisk that together, please.

215
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:41,993
        And we really wanna have
             that super eggy

216
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:44,029
         'cause this is gonna be
          a really tight batter

217
00:07:44,031 --> 00:07:45,297
          that's gonna go around
           this ground chicken.

218
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:47,532
               We did the ground
              chicken ourselves.

219
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:49,935
        We have our whisk. Okay.

220
00:07:49,937 --> 00:07:53,104
 We did the, uh, we did the, uh,
    ground chicken ourselves.

221
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:55,140
        You can't always find
    ground chicken in the store.

222
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:57,108
              But if you get
           equal parts of breast

223
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,211
       and thigh or your mixture
            that you like,

224
00:07:59,213 --> 00:08:01,680
           and you take that,
        I'll tell you something.

225
00:08:01,682 --> 00:08:03,281
               Just freeze it up
                 a little bit.

226
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:04,716
                 Throw it into
               a food processor.

227
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:06,518
          And you're good to go.

228
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,687
                      Hi, Roxy.
Wanna help?

229
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:10,489
                 All right.
             So a little fennel,

230
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:11,990
              a little zucchini.
                  Okay, Mom.

231
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:13,525
       Let me ask you a question
         while I'm doing this,

232
00:08:13,527 --> 00:08:15,861
            while I'm -- while
          I'm daring my fingers.
Okay.

233
00:08:15,863 --> 00:08:18,063
             Uh, favorite thing
             about Cuba, what --

234
00:08:18,065 --> 00:08:19,965
                besides the fact
                that I took you?

235
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:23,502
Oh. Oh, I'd say it's the night
 that you went to bed at 9:00,

236
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:26,404
and I went out till 3:00.

237
00:08:26,406 --> 00:08:29,241
        I can't believe you just
          told everybody that.

238
00:08:29,243 --> 00:08:31,476
       That is so ridiculous.
    I did not go to bed at 9:00.

239
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:33,144
                    It was 9:30.
I went to Cuba for the music.

240
00:08:33,146 --> 00:08:36,448
     It was -- it was 9:30, Mom.

241
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,984
       So, yeah. So I, you know,
         listen, I'm working.

242
00:08:38,986 --> 00:08:40,819
        I got things going on.
       We're over there shooting

243
00:08:40,821 --> 00:08:42,954
                a, uh, a special
                 for "Triple D"

244
00:08:42,956 --> 00:08:45,023
                and for, uh,
             the Travel Channel.

245
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,925
                So I'm doing
            my responsible part.

246
00:08:46,927 --> 00:08:48,193
                She's goin' out.

247
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:49,828
      They don't start the music
        in Cuba till what time?

248
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,229
It started at midnight,

249
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:53,298
 but it was really 1:00
because the time changed.

250
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,900
           You all set up? Okay.
I'm all ready.

251
00:08:54,902 --> 00:08:57,068
  Little salt on this is gonna
 bring out some of the moisture.

252
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,337
   We're gonna be making a salad
    outta this in a little bit.

253
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:02,641
            I'll set this aside.

254
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:04,976
      Let me get a pan hot here.

255
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:07,178
   I've got a little prosciutto
   that I'm just gonna crisp up.

256
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,446
 This is gonna be kinda the, uh,

257
00:09:08,448 --> 00:09:10,682
  the garnish or the little bit
         of the crouton

258
00:09:10,684 --> 00:09:12,484
    for this fantastic salad

259
00:09:12,486 --> 00:09:13,885
         with the fennel
        and the zucchini.

260
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:16,354
         Mom, you ready
     to do this over there?

261
00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:19,991
   Let me just fold this over.

262
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:21,860
        I love prosciutto
        when it's crispy.

263
00:09:21,862 --> 00:09:25,297
      There's just a salty
       nuttiness about it.

264
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:27,933
    And it's always worth it,
 getting really good prosciutto.

265
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:32,504
     Okay. We'll drop this --
   Actually, Mom, do me a favor.

266
00:09:32,506 --> 00:09:33,672
            -Uh-huh?
 -Little olive oil right there,

267
00:09:33,674 --> 00:09:35,574
  the first one in front of you,
           that bottle,

268
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:37,375
               just so it
         doesn't stick too much.

269
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:39,377
How do you know if it's
really good prosciutto?
                   There you go.

270
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:40,645
           All right. I'm sorry?

271
00:09:40,647 --> 00:09:42,380
How do you know if it's
really good prosciutto?

272
00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:45,216
The price or...
   Well, sadly enough, by price.

273
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:47,152
               But really, uh,
             you're looking for,

274
00:09:47,154 --> 00:09:48,920
               uh, imported
          prosciutto from Italy.

275
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:51,823
     You're also looking at the,
      uh, how long it was aged.

276
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:53,425
            They age prosciutto.
                    Okay.

277
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:55,694
                Let this go.
            Let's get into this.

278
00:09:55,696 --> 00:09:58,096
      This is where things
      are gonna get dicey.

279
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:00,298
Uh, outta the freezer,

280
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,768
pulling out

281
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:07,439
              our log of butter.

282
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:09,441
            Now this is the one
          that we took and mixed

283
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:12,744
          with the cream cheese,

284
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:14,546
           the butter, the dill.

285
00:10:14,548 --> 00:10:16,414
      The dill is what really
   makes the dish come together.

286
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:17,882
         -Did it freeze?
             -Yeah.

287
00:10:17,884 --> 00:10:19,417
            -Oh, wow.
  -Oh, yeah. It's frozen hard.

288
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:20,552
      And the reason it is, Mom,

289
00:10:20,554 --> 00:10:21,853
            you'll see this here
                in a second,

290
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:23,855
        is I want it frozen so
       when we start to cook it,

291
00:10:23,857 --> 00:10:25,290
    it doesn't start to leak out

292
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:26,992
           all this great flavor
            right off the bat.

293
00:10:26,994 --> 00:10:28,393
             -Right.
             -Okay?

294
00:10:28,395 --> 00:10:30,028
                About that size.

295
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,429
      And you're gonna have
      to follow along here

296
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:33,365
    'cause this gets real --
             -Okay.

297
00:10:33,367 --> 00:10:35,367
Real quick real fast.
        Okay?

298
00:10:35,369 --> 00:10:38,336
So ground chicken,
thighs and breast,

299
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:40,038
cut it in half.

300
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,873
Just so I don't use
too much of one...
                          Right.

301
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:44,075
I found this method. I do this
 a lot when I'm doing burgers.

302
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:46,444
Okay. So then I got four
     equal portions.
                        Okay.

303
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:47,712
     Okay?
                       Yep.

304
00:10:47,714 --> 00:10:49,714
So now, pick it up
   with my hand.

305
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:53,385
Gonna kinda compact it
together a little bit.

306
00:10:53,387 --> 00:10:57,489
Make a little bit
   of a canoe.

307
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:59,591
      -Okay? Nice and firm.
             -Okay.

308
00:10:59,593 --> 00:11:01,993
Drop that inside.

309
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:04,229
Okay? Wrap it around.

310
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:05,964
   I'm gonna steal
a little bit of this.

311
00:11:05,966 --> 00:11:07,298
             You're gonna end up
                 with three.

312
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,767
Well, it might be three.
       But listen.

313
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:12,037
   As big and as bodacious
and delicious as these are --

314
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:13,471
    And I've also got
some more frozen chicken.

315
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:15,140
So I can knock that out.
      But the idea

316
00:11:15,142 --> 00:11:17,809
  is just to make sure
that it's evenly coated.

317
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:19,144
Okay? So we got --

318
00:11:19,146 --> 00:11:21,279
    -Like pigs in a blanket.
         -It's -- yeah.

319
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:22,714
  Just weird --
just with raw --

320
00:11:22,716 --> 00:11:25,250
You wanna stir that for me?
           Okay.

321
00:11:25,252 --> 00:11:29,120
Okay. Now, the wet chicken
     is gonna pick up

322
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:30,588
  a little bit of
the seasoned flour.

323
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:31,756
                         Uh-huh.

324
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:33,091
Actually, that's probably
    gone enough, Mom.

325
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:34,526
    You can just
pull it off the heat.

326
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:36,094
   So a little bit of
the seasoned flour sticks

327
00:11:36,096 --> 00:11:37,796
to the wet chicken.

328
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:39,964
You're doing the rest of these.
You better be paying attention.

329
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:43,001
                      I am.
    Okay?

330
00:11:43,003 --> 00:11:47,172
Then we go into
 the egg wash,

331
00:11:47,174 --> 00:11:50,675
      egg wash into
the Italian bread crumb.

332
00:11:50,677 --> 00:11:52,777
     And this is
a really thick batter

333
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:54,245
that we're putting together.

334
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:56,948
So we'll go from the Italian
 bread crumb back into this,

335
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,717
back into the egg wash again.

336
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:01,186
 Why do you do two bread crumbs?
So it really creates

337
00:12:01,188 --> 00:12:02,654
       a coating on it
so when it starts to cook --

338
00:12:02,656 --> 00:12:04,456
'Cause we're gonna pan-fry it,
  then finish it in the oven.

339
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:05,590
And this will keep it from --

340
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:06,858
this will really
create a barrier

341
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,126
so the cheese doesn't explode.

342
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:09,861
               But why two kinds
               of bread crumbs?

343
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:11,096
Those are a little bit
       thinner.

344
00:12:11,098 --> 00:12:12,530
These are a little
  bit crunchier.

345
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:13,832
We're explaining it all. See?
   We're learning at home.

346
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:15,300
  We're spreading
attention together.

347
00:12:15,302 --> 00:12:16,501
See you in a little bit.

348
00:12:16,503 --> 00:12:17,869
She's gonna get started
  on these right now.

349
00:12:17,871 --> 00:12:19,037
I've done one. And I'm done.

350
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:20,205
 Go ahead, Mom.
Jump in. Grab it.

351
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:30,081
   Welcome back. Special day.
     My mom's on "Big Bite."

352
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,851
      So you know that, uh,
   not a lot is getting done.

353
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:34,786
    And there's more laughing --
              Oh, hey.

354
00:12:34,788 --> 00:12:36,221
How'd I do?

355
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:38,723
          Uh, you did --
  I'm actually really impressed.

356
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:40,291
How was your e-mails?
           My e-mails were good.

357
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:41,726
While I was doin' all the work.
                      Thank you.

358
00:12:41,728 --> 00:12:43,027
         I have important things
            I'm dealing with.

359
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:44,462
         I don't know what those
         important things were.

360
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:46,397
              Okay. Fantastic.
             So what we did here

361
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,366
            is we made this
       ground chicken ourselves.

362
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:50,869
    And my mom, very diligently,
           by the way, uh,

363
00:12:50,871 --> 00:12:52,403
       took this compound butter

364
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:54,038
            that's got a little,
              uh, cream cheese

365
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,574
                and Pepper Jack
               and, uh, paprika,

366
00:12:56,576 --> 00:12:58,943
          mixed it all together,
           put it inside frozen,

367
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,512
      wrapped the chicken around
        it and then dredged it.

368
00:13:00,514 --> 00:13:02,147
              And we're talkin'
             heavy dredge, okay?

369
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:03,948
   -We're talkin', uh, flour.
             -Flour.

370
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,116
           Then went to the egg,

371
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,584
              then went to
        the Italian bread crumb,

372
00:13:06,586 --> 00:13:08,219
      then went back to the egg,
        then went to the panko.

373
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:10,321
                 So oil is right
                 about 350, Mom.

374
00:13:10,323 --> 00:13:11,656
             -Okay.
           -Go ahead.

375
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:13,892
              Here's a spoon.
          Lay that on the spoon.

376
00:13:13,894 --> 00:13:15,727
                 And just gently
                 drop those in.

377
00:13:15,729 --> 00:13:17,095
             -Okay.
     -And you're good to go.

378
00:13:17,097 --> 00:13:18,563
           On the -- While she's
             workin' on that,

379
00:13:18,565 --> 00:13:20,231
     I've got some, uh, zucchini
           and some fennel

380
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:22,033
                 that I, uh,
             salted in the back.

381
00:13:22,035 --> 00:13:23,535
        I'm gonna rinse that off
            in a bit to make

382
00:13:23,537 --> 00:13:25,737
      this really nice salad
  that's gonna go along with it.

383
00:13:25,739 --> 00:13:27,172
               You see, when you
               put it in there,

384
00:13:27,174 --> 00:13:28,807
            how it just comes up
               about halfway?
Yeah. Yeah.

385
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:30,408
        We'll fry both of these.
              There you go.

386
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:31,943
   Don't put it too close to it.
Okay.

387
00:13:31,945 --> 00:13:34,245
          Okay? The idea is not
        to really mess with them

388
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:36,147
         because you're starting
        to set up the crust now.

389
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,716
              It's kind of in
           a very tender moment.

390
00:13:38,718 --> 00:13:39,751
             Um, once it starts
             to build its crust,

391
00:13:39,753 --> 00:13:41,586
 tse in the oven.
              It's kind of in
           a very tender moment.

392
00:13:41,588 --> 00:13:43,555
   Okay.
            Um, you can go ahead

393
00:13:43,557 --> 00:13:45,356
         and pluck some of those
             fronds for me.

394
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:46,791
             -Okay.
-I just need some of the fronds.

395
00:13:46,793 --> 00:13:49,060
        This is gonna go for
     the dressing for the salad.

396
00:13:49,062 --> 00:13:51,362
       Typically, the Kiev
     is served with noodles.

397
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:54,532
So this is my California version
   of serving it with noodles.

398
00:13:54,534 --> 00:13:55,667
            You know,
     when you take zucchini,

399
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:57,402
      and you slice it thin
        on the mandoline,

400
00:13:57,404 --> 00:13:59,604
   add a little fennel to it,
     made a little dressing,

401
00:13:59,606 --> 00:14:01,105
           olive oil,
     some garlic, some salt,

402
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:03,174
           some pepper
      and the fennel fronds

403
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:05,643
 and a little bit of lemon zest
        and lemon juice.

404
00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:07,779
      Took some prosciutto,
         sliced it thin,

405
00:14:07,781 --> 00:14:09,614
        threw it in a pan
      and crisped that up.

406
00:14:09,616 --> 00:14:11,449
     Combine it all together
       and then top it off

407
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:13,785
 with a little shaved pecorino,
         nice and salty.

408
00:14:13,787 --> 00:14:17,222
    Ah, a raw salad like this
  with such flavor and texture,

409
00:14:17,224 --> 00:14:18,957
      perfect for the Kiev.

410
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,559
          Okay. Dressing's done.
               There we go.

411
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:22,894
           Now, want a cocktail,
                  Mother?

412
00:14:22,896 --> 00:14:24,062
             I know I don't need
              to ask you that.

413
00:14:24,064 --> 00:14:25,396
           -Of course.
             -Okay.

414
00:14:25,398 --> 00:14:26,764
          -Of course --
      -Let's talk about --

415
00:14:26,766 --> 00:14:28,266
Have you ever had a Moscow Mule?
Yep.

416
00:14:28,268 --> 00:14:31,536
    Okay. So this isn't the idea
         of the Moscow Mule.

417
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:34,339
      But we're gonna use,
     in this Moscow Mule --

418
00:14:34,341 --> 00:14:37,008
     Let me grab this here.

419
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:39,510
      -Grab all my goodies.
        -Lazy man's load.

420
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:40,845
      -You need some help?
              -No.

421
00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:42,180
                  This is not
              a lazy man's load.

422
00:14:42,182 --> 00:14:44,115
- Except I forgot one thing.
  -Good.

423
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:45,850
           All right.
       So the Moscow Mule,

424
00:14:45,852 --> 00:14:47,418
    there's a lotta theories
           about this.

425
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:50,321
  One -- The real, true theory
 is it didn't come from Moscow.

426
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:52,523
             Two -- Moscow Mules
               have that kick.

427
00:14:52,525 --> 00:14:55,093
         They say the kick comes
         from that ginger beer.

428
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:58,997
  So what I'm gonna do is drop
 in some beautiful blackberries.

429
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:00,798
       These are too big.
They didn't come from our ranch.

430
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,267
      Our berry bushes are tiny.

431
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:03,334
            And the deer eat 'em
                all the time.

432
00:15:03,336 --> 00:15:05,570
                 So these we got
                from the market.

433
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:08,006
            Um, we'll get, uh...

434
00:15:08,008 --> 00:15:10,408
          That has garlic on it.

435
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,243
      -That'll taste good.
  -Little garlic and some lime.

436
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,879
That's how they got the coffee
   in the -- in the lobster.

437
00:15:14,881 --> 00:15:16,614
               Yeah, it was,
          the coffee in lobster.

438
00:15:16,616 --> 00:15:18,616
          So we go to this place
             called El Figaro.

439
00:15:18,618 --> 00:15:21,319
       And, uh, it's in a place
       called Barbershops Alley.

440
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:23,154
   -And they made a lobster...
             -Yeah.

441
00:15:23,156 --> 00:15:25,189
          ...that was done with
         with an espresso sauce,

442
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:27,725
                     outrageous.
Am I gonna put these on here?

443
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:28,893
         Yeah. Go ahead and swap
             those out, Mom.

444
00:15:28,895 --> 00:15:30,161
             Perfect. All right.

445
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:32,664
           So let me get in here
             and muddle this,

446
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:36,467
                few ice cubes
             just to help build.

447
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:37,769
                    There we go.

448
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:39,337
             So the Moscow Mule,
             they say that it --

449
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:41,472
   they call it the Mule because
  it's got the ginger beer kick.

450
00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:44,475
         So you're talkin' about
          vodka and ginger beer

451
00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:45,944
       and a little bit of lime.

452
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:48,413
     So what we're doin' here
  is adding in the blackberries.

453
00:15:48,415 --> 00:15:50,181
             Still got the lime.

454
00:15:50,183 --> 00:15:53,017
        And we are gonna hit it
      with a little ginger beer.

455
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:55,586
           But look at that,
       nice little muddle there.

456
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:58,890
        -You work quick.
              -Oh.

457
00:15:58,892 --> 00:15:59,958
           I gotta stay on --
        I gotta stay on my toes.

458
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,526
          -Keep goin'.
        -Oh. So these...

459
00:16:01,528 --> 00:16:03,061
               You got it. Yeah.

460
00:16:03,063 --> 00:16:04,295
           -All right.
             -Okay.

461
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:06,230
            The drinks in Cuba,
           that was interesting.

462
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:08,833
           I went and made the,
           uh, had the daiquiris

463
00:16:08,835 --> 00:16:10,401
             at, uh, Hemingway's
              place where he --

464
00:16:10,403 --> 00:16:11,736
    where his -- his, uh, haunt.

465
00:16:11,738 --> 00:16:13,137
                 Did you guys
               make it by there?

466
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,973
We went to one bar he went,
     but not that one.

467
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:16,607
         Well, you could've gone
          to any bar in Havana.

468
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:17,942
    I think he might've gone to.
That's true.

469
00:16:17,944 --> 00:16:19,711
             Okay. Little bit --

470
00:16:19,713 --> 00:16:22,313
       The one we went to,
the only picture I saw of Castro

471
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:26,551
in the whole place in Havana,
       the whole city,

472
00:16:26,553 --> 00:16:29,921
was with, uh, Hemingway
and Castro in this bar.

473
00:16:29,923 --> 00:16:31,255
           -And, uh...
            -Really?

474
00:16:31,257 --> 00:16:32,557
Yeah. It was a great place.

475
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:34,225
         We went to the place
       that makes the daiquiris.

476
00:16:34,227 --> 00:16:36,494
       And I'm telling you,
  the daiquiris were outrageous.

477
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:37,595
         I mean, I didn't think,
                you know,

478
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:39,931
        what could be so special
            about the daiq--

479
00:16:39,933 --> 00:16:41,632
- Whoa.
    -Huh?

480
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:43,534
               See? I caught it.
                  Okay, Mom.

481
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:45,203
Right in the fridge right there,
 if you wouldn't mind grabbing,

482
00:16:45,205 --> 00:16:47,372
           top drawer, should be
          a couple ginger beers.

483
00:16:47,374 --> 00:16:48,539
Okay.

484
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:51,476
                So pour that
             right over the top.

485
00:16:51,478 --> 00:16:53,878
         Get some of the muddled
            berries in there.

486
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:58,216
       I just probably need one.

487
00:16:58,218 --> 00:17:00,318
Is this beer real --
    really beer?
                           Yeah.

488
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,153
Okay. Ale, yeah.

489
00:17:02,155 --> 00:17:04,222
            Okay. Gonna do that.

490
00:17:08,094 --> 00:17:09,727
  What? Lucky you
didn't hit your --

491
00:17:09,729 --> 00:17:11,295
           Part of the --
    It's part of the trick, Mom.

492
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:13,031
           I'm just tryin' to do
           a little show for ya.

493
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:16,334
Okay? So we pour the ginger beer
    right over the top of it.

494
00:17:16,336 --> 00:17:18,369
              There we go. So...
 Nice.

495
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:20,638
      I'm wearing half the meal,
       hangin' out with my mom,

496
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,774
             talking about Cuba,
             having a cocktail,

497
00:17:22,776 --> 00:17:24,075
  cooking outdoors at the ranch.

498
00:17:24,077 --> 00:17:25,476
      It doesn't get any better,

499
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:26,844
            well, until we start
              eating all this.

500
00:17:26,846 --> 00:17:28,046
        See you in a little bit.
  Cheers.

501
00:17:34,954 --> 00:17:36,320
          Welcome back.

502
00:17:36,322 --> 00:17:37,588
   Chicken Kiev, chicken Kiev

503
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,057
        like you probably
     haven't seen it before.

504
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:41,592
    This is a little tribute
         to my, uh, trip

505
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:43,895
   that I took to Cuba
with Lori and my parents

506
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:46,230
and making chicken Kiev
 with ground chicken.

507
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:48,299
We made this compound butter
    with a little cheese,

508
00:17:48,301 --> 00:17:51,602
stuffed it in there, outrageous.
          And a salad.

509
00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:53,137
So you're working
on the pecorino.

510
00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:54,605
                        Yep.
  Would you mind,
uh, just dicing up

511
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:55,940
a little bit of the chive?

512
00:17:55,942 --> 00:17:57,608
             -So...
             -Okay.

513
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,010
What we've got here --

514
00:17:59,012 --> 00:18:02,013
    What we've got here is
a little fennel, some zucchini.

515
00:18:02,015 --> 00:18:04,182
And my mom is drinking
   the Moscow Mule.

516
00:18:04,184 --> 00:18:05,450
Mom, you're quiet.

517
00:18:05,452 --> 00:18:06,884
 Did you get tied up
in Moscow Mule, or...

518
00:18:06,886 --> 00:18:09,887
I'm concentrating on my job.

519
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:11,522
  You're doing
a very nice job.

520
00:18:11,524 --> 00:18:14,325
    So we made a Moscow Mule,
but we put blackberries into it.

521
00:18:14,327 --> 00:18:16,561
So you take the traditional Mule

522
00:18:16,563 --> 00:18:18,362
that everybody loves
with the ginger beer.

523
00:18:18,364 --> 00:18:19,864
Well, we did that, uh,

524
00:18:19,866 --> 00:18:21,432
a little bit of the lime
     and the vodka,

525
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:23,201
topped off with the ginger beer.
         It's fantastic.

526
00:18:23,203 --> 00:18:24,502
Where's yours, by the way?
  Is this yours or mine?

527
00:18:24,504 --> 00:18:27,238
              Yeah. That's mine.
                This is yours.

528
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,107
All right.

529
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:31,209
Oh, I should know that's yours.
     There's more missing.

530
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:33,544
Mm.

531
00:18:33,546 --> 00:18:35,446
Those aren't blackberries
     from the ranch.

532
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:37,148
  But I would like to take
all the credit in the world.

533
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:38,449
       -They're fantastic.
              -Mm.

534
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:40,384
Made a little vinaigrette
  right here from, uh,

535
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:43,888
   the fronds of the fennel,
some garlic, some lemon juice,

536
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:46,257
 salt and pepper,
a little olive oil.

537
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:48,092
Stack that up.

538
00:18:48,094 --> 00:18:49,460
Hit it with a little salt.

539
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:50,695
      Do you know
that about the throwing

540
00:18:50,697 --> 00:18:51,796
the salt on the veggies,

541
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:53,498
how it kinda makes 'em
    a little bit --

542
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,866
pulls out some of
 the moisture...
                         Uh-huh.

543
00:18:54,868 --> 00:18:56,234
...and kinda gives them
    a little bit --

544
00:18:56,236 --> 00:18:57,635
makes them a little
  more toothsome.

545
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:59,937
 Okay. So, you know,
typically, on a Kiev,

546
00:18:59,939 --> 00:19:01,372
which is actually
 a French dish,

547
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:03,708
  but the Kiev typically has,
like, a butter noodle with it.

548
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,309
Well, we changed it up a bit.

549
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:07,879
    Chives go in here, or there?
Yeah. Right on the top of that.

550
00:19:07,881 --> 00:19:08,813
And then, also, I've got
a little prosciutto that

551
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:10,081
    Chives go in here, or there?
l just throw
Yon top of this,he top of that.

552
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,849
nice little salty crunch.
                            Wow.

553
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:13,618
And then hit some of that --
  Is that gorgeous or what?

554
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,720
                     It's so --
And then take some
  of the pecorino

555
00:19:15,722 --> 00:19:17,388
and drop that over the top.
                           Okay.

556
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:19,423
       All right.
Eenie, meenie, miney, mo.

557
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:21,359
Here's one.
                            Wow.

558
00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:23,294
There's mine.

559
00:19:23,296 --> 00:19:25,663
                Why is my mouth
               watering already?

560
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:27,398
Oh, it's fantastic,
  beautiful dish.

561
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,168
         -Is that good?
             -Okay.

562
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,236
Little bit of the zucchini
      and the fennel.

563
00:19:32,238 --> 00:19:34,172
Come on over, Mom.
Grab one of these.

564
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:36,440
                            Yum.

565
00:19:36,442 --> 00:19:38,843
The whole inspiration
  for this dish...
                           Nice.

566
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:40,578
...was that this is what she
missed when we were in Cuba.

567
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,280
  We were out there
shooting "Triple D,"

568
00:19:42,282 --> 00:19:43,814
doing all types
of adventures.

569
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:45,483
  She and my dad
were gone one day.

570
00:19:45,485 --> 00:19:46,851
They didn't make it
to this restaurant.

571
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:49,020
  We had this chicken Kiev.
I thought it was outrageous.

572
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:51,088
So I said, "Why not make it?"
      So let's dig in.

573
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,256
                      Thank you.
There you go.

574
00:19:52,258 --> 00:19:53,424
                      All right.

575
00:19:53,426 --> 00:19:54,926
I hope I did it right.

576
00:19:54,928 --> 00:19:57,628
 I'm gonna cut it in the middle,
        see what happens.

577
00:19:58,665 --> 00:19:59,864
                     Oh, my God.
There you go.

578
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:01,199
             Look at that juice.

579
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:03,768
So what you get is you get
that Pepper Jack cheese...

580
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,636
                       Wow.
...the butter...

581
00:20:05,638 --> 00:20:07,104
                   Look at this.
Or the Pepper Jack cheese,

582
00:20:07,106 --> 00:20:09,774
the dill and the parsley
     all coming out.

583
00:20:09,776 --> 00:20:11,475
                   It's amazing.
We double-battered it,

584
00:20:11,477 --> 00:20:15,413
 so it really locked
in all of the, uh...

585
00:20:15,415 --> 00:20:16,547
Oh.
                Is that awesome?

586
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:17,848
That's fantastic.

587
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,684
 It really locked
in all that flavor.

588
00:20:19,686 --> 00:20:21,185
So as it was cooking, normally,

589
00:20:21,187 --> 00:20:24,222
you'd see cheese kind of
coming out a little bit.

590
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:26,390
The veggie noodles, huh?

591
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:29,360
Zucchini can play
well with others.

592
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:31,929
And the fennel,
 thin real --

593
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:33,898
sliced really thin,
hit with that acid.

594
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,733
                Oh, that's good.
But that Kiev,

595
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:37,268
     tell me that
doesn't make the list.

596
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:39,804
                   It's awesome.
                     Good job.

597
00:20:39,806 --> 00:20:41,072
That's my mom. Huh?

598
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:42,640
Doesn't get any better
      than this,

599
00:20:42,642 --> 00:20:44,508
 hangin' out in the backyard
at the ranch, cookin' it up,

600
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,777
       drinkin' a little
Blackberry Mule with this girl.

601
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:49,380
See you next week, "Big Bite."
        Good job, Mom.

602
00:20:49,382 --> 00:20:50,948
           -Thank you.
 -You did great. Look at these.

603
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,416
     -They stayed together.
       -It was fun. Yeah.

    "We're talking Texas-style.",
    "No tomatoes, no beans,  real deal Texas-style chili,",
    "and that's what I'm gonna         give you today.",
    "My Texas-style chili is packed  with ground beef, cubed beef,",
    "dried chilies, fresh chilies, onions, garlic, cumin and more.",
    "And it's served with, get this,",

    "Oh, yeah. This is the one   that's guaranteed to score",
    "some major points.             Get it?",

    "And you can bet those are gonna       fly off the plate.",
    "In fact, you might want     to make a double batch.",
    "All right.       Let's get started.",
    "Dutch oven going hot.",
    "Onions busted down.",
    "A little bit of garlic        into my peppers.",
    "So listen.          You're gonna",

    "This chili    is not outrageously hot.",
    "So it doesn't mean that you  have to go with the big heat.",
    "But we're gonna  use some Anaheims right here.",
    "Okay.       And we got a bunch",
    "a bunch of dry chilies that we're gonna bust into as well.",
    "Now, I'm gonna cut 'em down into a pretty usable size.",
    "Actually, let me go ahead and  drop some of these now 'cause",

    "So a little bit of olive oil.",
    "We'll get down   with the onions right now.",
    "And this is, just like I said,",
    "no beans, no tomatoes.",
    "And that's what's funny.",
    "Because when you give people        chili like this,",
    "they're like, \"Hey, I think    you're missing something.",
    "This kind of looks       like a meat sauce.\"",
    "Well, you got to remember --        chili con carne.",
    "Meat and pepper.",
    "Okay.",
    "Drop those down.",
    "A great way   to break this chili down --",
    "split 'em,",
    "take the seeds, not a lot   of membrane inside of here.",
    "That...just the key",
    "is just to make sure   we got some uniform sizes.",
    "There we go.",
    "Some red bell.",
    "Okay.",
    "Drop those in.          Look at that.",
    "Just sweating up nice.",
    "This Fresno chili here,",
    "I'm not too worried      about the heat on it.",
    "Pretty mild.",
    "So I'll just give it a couple slices down the front.",
    "And I won't add that garlic yetbecause I don't want it to burn.",
    "And I got a lot of heat    going in this right now.",
    "So far, so good, huh?",
    "Okay.",
    "Let this continue to sweat down.",
    "Add a little bit of salt to it.",
    "Let's get into dry chilies.",
    "Now, this is really  the foundation of this chili.",
    "So what we're first starting off",
    "is with some Chile de arbol,    which is nice and spicy.",
    "The ancho and Guajillo chile,",
    "which, to me,    is my favorite dry chili.",
    "And so the ancho's deep            and rich.",
    "The Guajillo's got  a nice little spice and kick.",
    "And, of course,       the Chile de arbol",
    "has definitely got the heat.",
    "So taking those,",
    "charring 'em is the beginning          of this dish.",
    "And, believe it or not, the red   color that's gonna come out",
    "is gonna be outrageous.",
    "So these will sit here           and toast.",
    "Get a little more heat on that.",
    "There we go.",
    "Let me get this stuff         in the compost.",
    "And let's talk about potatoes.",
    "So a lot of people   show up for game day feast.",
    "And they're expecting the --      the regular old fare.",
    "We're gonna      do some potato skins.",
    "Oh, but we're gonna fill 'em    with brie and prosciutto.",
    "Just got to knock it--",
    "you just can't let 'em know         what's coming.",
    "Got to give 'em a little            surprise.",
    "So here is some beautiful     baked Russet potatoes.",
    "So what I'm gonna do.",
    "There's a key of where I want to slice these.",
    "Okay.    If I slice 'em like this,",
    "then I'm gonna  get these really flat boats.",
    "What I want to do    is slice 'em on the flat.",
    "Okay.",
    "Like so.",
    "Take 'em on the flat like this,",
    "carve into them,   leaving about a 1/4 inch --",
    "leaving about a 1/4 inch",
    "of the flesh around there so they don't become too thin.",
    "Because what's gonna happen is,",
    "after I take all this flesh          out of them,",
    "let them cool down a bit.",
    "Then I'm gonna deep fry 'em.",
    "What do you think of that?",
    "♪♪",
    "All right.        And the last one.",
    "Now, these potatoes  are still a little bit warm,",
    "so I'm gonna  let 'em cool down here a bit.",
    "And you got to save      those potato innards.",
    "I mean, you're talking potato pancakes.",
    "You got all kinds        of options there.",
    "All right.    So let me do this first.",
    "Um, the Guaji...",
    "The -- the peppers over here  have really toasted up nice.",
    "I don't want 'em to burn.",
    "So now, I'm gonna reconstitute   'em with just a little bit",
    "of hot water.              Okay.",
    "I'm gonna do it right there in that pan.",
    "That is a hot pan.",
    "Little more water.",
    "And we'll just let those kind    of hang out for a second.",
    "And those are gonna go directlyinto the chili in just a minute.",
    "Speaking of the chili,   I need to get those peppers",
    "and onions out of there",
    "because now I have got         some top round",
    "that I want to brown off.",
    "And we're talking about --",
    "I don't want it       to be interrupted.",
    "I really want to build           some crust,",
    "kind of like we're searing          a short rib.",
    "So what I want to do      is get all these out",
    "'cause you leave just a little      bit of this in there,",
    "there's a lot of moisture.",
    "It will keep it from --",
    "It'll keep the meat    from really browning up.",
    "It's just chasing these around         inside of here.",
    "There we go.              Okay.",
    "Over here. Let that continue to stay hot.",
    "We'll go over here.      There's ground beef.",
    "But right now, the roast.",
    "Now, this is a great thing.",
    "We're talking about stew meat           right here.",
    "We're talk-- Look at that.",
    "Look how beautiful.",
    "Huh?",
    "So we'll just hit it        with a little --",
    "a little touch of some salt.",
    "And we'll just drop it --",
    "Crank that pan back up.",
    "Right back in.",
    "There we go.",
    "Nice little sear gonna         happen to that.",
    "Now, I also      have some ground beef",
    "that I'll put in        in a little bit.",
    "I like to have      two of the textures.",
    "This is gonna    be really nice and chewy.",
    "It's got some real,     great steak-feel to it.",
    "But it will be super tender.",
    "And then, that ground beef.",
    "Well, that just kind of works its way around all the peppers",
    "and all that sauce   that's gonna be happening.",
    "Okay.    We'll let that brown up.",
    "Now, the skins.",
    "What's gonna happen with these?",
    "Well, what I'm gonna do is I got  a little bit of the texture,",
    "little bit of potato       left on the inside.",
    "Drop 'em in at about 350.",
    "And here's the beauty           with these.",
    "We're gonna stuff 'em.            Oh, yeah.",
    "So, I want you to think about  a gigantic hollow french fry",
    "that we're gonna jam       some prosciutto in,",
    "some brie, some mushrooms.",
    "I mean, the list goes on and on.",
    "So let me put these down.       You guys come back.",
    "We'll continue      to work on the chili.",
    "We got so many      big flavors going on.",
    "And this isall for that big game day feast.",
    "See you in a bit.",
    "So it's game day feast",
    "here at the Fieri house,        in the backyard.",
    "And yes, game day  and leeks do go hand-in-hand.",
    "I've got some leeks   that I'm gonna be sautéing,",
    "here in a second,  with some cremini mushrooms.",
    "But, uh, I'll show you   this little leek technique.",
    "Remember when the leek grows,   it's growing up like this.",
    "So the opportunity for sand",
    "and dirt and everythingto fall down into those crevices",
    "is really,  uh, is really, uh, happening.",
    "So what we want to do         is I cut mine.",
    "Makes it a little      bit easier to clean.",
    "And then, I'll just give 'em      a quick little chop,",
    "drop 'em into the water.",
    "I can swirl 'em around          with my hand",
    "and just kind of wash         'em like that,",
    "or rinse 'em, I should say.",
    "Some people leave the rounds  together, but what I find is",
    "that if they -- the rounds don't  get completely broken apart,",
    "you have a chance  of getting yourself some sand",
    "and some dirt into it.",
    "So this is all gonna come            together.",
    "Well, I'll just do it          with my hand.",
    "This is all gonna come together",
    "for a fantastic      stuffed potato skin.",
    "And, actually, I've got to drop    some of the potato skins.",
    "So let me let this settle     down here for a second.",
    "Some baked potatoes just left   with about a 1/4 inch, uh,",
    "interior right there.",
    "Salted them      before I roasted 'em.",
    "And we'll drop 'em       in 350-degree oil.",
    "And yes,   I want these to almost get",
    "like a hollowed-out french fry.",
    "Okay.     Almost potato chip-like",
    "because we're gonna be throwingin some brie cheese, prosciutto,",
    "and some mushrooms and all that.",
    "And speaking of which,          I need to get",
    "my leeks going here in a second.",
    "So couple tablespoons of butter.",
    "And I'm just gonna      shake the leeks off.",
    "Drop 'em in the butter.   And I have some ground beef",
    "going over herewith some 1-inch cubes of chuck.",
    "And I cooked those in the oil",
    "that I had just sweated   some peppers and onions in.",
    "And in we'll go with the leeks.",
    "And then, over there, also,",
    "I have some steeped peppersthat I kind of toasted off a bit",
    "to get nice and,    uh, well, nice and rustic",
    "because we're making       Texas-style chili.",
    "No beans and no --        and no tomatoes.",
    "Okay.",
    "Drop these in.",
    "Set this aside.",
    "Creminis, my favorite.",
    "I'm telling you,  one of my favorite mushrooms.",
    "I can't say  it's absolutely my favorite,",
    "but it definitely is one          of the best.",
    "Really nice and meaty.",
    "Lots of really defined        mushroom flavor.",
    "And we're gonna cook  these down with these leeks.",
    "It'll work out perfectly.",
    "♪♪",
    "All right.         That's enough.",
    "Okay.",
    "Bring it right over.         Drop these in.",
    "And you know      what this needs here?",
    "Is just a little touch of thyme.",
    "I got some fresh thyme          standing by.",
    "That's all gonna cook         down together.",
    "Throw a little more heat on it.",
    "And all the thyme       comes out together.",
    "And just the leaves          of the thyme.",
    "Okay.        I know this seems",
    "a little bit more refined than you're thinking game day food.",
    "But, you know,    when you say potato skin",
    "and then you say, \"But I'm   stuffing it with mushrooms,",
    "and brie and prosciutto,\" you      can get away with it.",
    "All right.      Now, back over here.",
    "Let's take a look at this.",
    "The meat looks great, getting   a nice little brown to it.",
    "That's what I was trying     to achieve with that is",
    "just get a little crust on it.              Okay.",
    "What does it need?",
    "Well, it needs a little bit         of this garlic.",
    "I held out on the garlic      till the last moment",
    "because I didn't want           it to burn.",
    "And I got to get        these peppers in.",
    "Let's get over to these peppers.",
    "Ow, hot handle.",
    "And I want that liquid and all.",
    "So I have these reconstituted           Guajillos,",
    "Chile de arbol and anchos.",
    "Okay.",
    "Hit that.",
    "Little bit of power.",
    "Puree it.",
    "There we go.",
    "We'll dump this right in here        on with the meat,",
    "in with that garlic       that I just added.",
    "That's where your real      flavor's coming from.",
    "So you look at this and you go, \"Well, it's red like chili,",
    "but there's no tomato in it?\"              Nope.",
    "No tomato.",
    "There we go.      Let me drop this in.",
    "Sweated peppers and onions    that we had from earlier.",
    "And that all gets mixed            together.",
    "Look at that.         Look -- Just --",
    "I mean, take a look inside this.             Now...",
    "Now it's time to go build   another layer of seasoning.",
    "So I've done some salt           and pepper.",
    "Got the peppers and the garlic.",
    "Now we'll do a touch           of Cayenne.",
    "A little oregano.",
    "A little bit of cumin.",
    "Got to have a little kiss          of cinnamon.",
    "Not too much of it.          Just a touch.",
    "Now, this all gets mixed            together",
    "and really gonna    build a big base flavor.",
    "But I've got to get some liquid             in here",
    "to help cook down that meat.",
    "So we'll get in here.",
    "2 quarts of beef stock.We're gonna let this go in here.",
    "It's gonna cook down, believe it     or not, for two hours.",
    "So I've got my creminis",
    "and my leeks getting ready to go  for my stuffed potato skins.",
    "And my potato skins   are just finishing up now.",
    "Here's chili.     Cheese sauce coming up.",
    "It's game day feast.",
    "And this is exactly      how I like to do it.",
    "See you in a little bit.",
    "Welcome back to \"Big Bite.\"",
    "Oh, man, I'm telling you,",
    "it's all coming together,            finally.",
    "Yes, I'm browning the butter.",
    "That's what you expect to find",
    "on a game day feast       at the Fieri house.",
    "Now, I'm actually making   some roux because I'm gonna",
    "make some beer cheddar   cheese sauce for my chili.",
    "So, just a little bit of flour     to go with that butter.",
    "Make a quick little roux.",
    "Basically, equal parts.",
    "Let's see where that gets us.",
    "There we go.",
    "Toast it off.         There you are.",
    "What do you have back here    in this cauldron of fun?",
    "Well, you've got     some Texas-style chili.",
    "All that beautiful red color,",
    "not coming from tomatoes.              Nope.",
    "We've got a bunch of,  uh, Guajillo peppers, ancho,",
    "little Chile de arbol.",
    "We got some poblanos.",
    "We got some onions, some garlic   and, then, some stew beef,",
    "some ground beef, uh,      all coming together.",
    "It is gonna be quite fantastic.",
    "And then, right here, well,",
    "some mushrooms and leeks to go in our stuffed potatoes.",
    "So these are actually          potato skins.",
    "Took some baked potatoes,   scooped 'em out, fried 'em.",
    "Nice and crunchy.          Look at that.",
    "Almost like a, uh, cross   between a hollow french fry",
    "and a potato chip.       Gonna go in there.",
    "I'll get to that in a second.",
    "But in the meantime,  we need to get a little beer.",
    "Beer cheddar cheese sauce.",
    "I mean, I like a cheese sauce       like anybody does,",
    "but when you're gonna make it",
    "and it's standing up  against big flavors like, uh,",
    "a Texas-style chili, you can't     just go out of the can",
    "with this one.",
    "So start with a roux,simple 50-50 of fat and flour --",
    "butter and flour,     a little half-and-half.",
    "Not too much half-and-half",
    "'cause we're adding in          a full beer.",
    "Nice amber beer so you're gonnaget that deep, rich beer flavor.",
    "Dropping in some sharp cheddar,",
    "grated, slowly,      little bit at a time",
    "so it doesn't seize up and get into that cheese ball.",
    "A little touch of Cayenne.",
    "And then,    this is where the flavors",
    "get a little bit funky.          Dry mustard.",
    "Got to have that little tang in there from the dry mustard.",
    "A little bit of Worcestershire.",
    "A little touch of paprika.          There we are.",
    "Stir in a little bit more            of this,",
    "and I got one more cheese",
    "to add to this to make   it really nice and velvety.",
    "And that will be...",
    "Exactly. Cream cheese.              Okay.",
    "I'll let that go.",
    "Get some cream cheese.",
    "I said, \"Game day food.\"         I did not say,",
    "\"This is the health show.\"              Okay.",
    "So we've got cream cheese.",
    "We got beer.        We've got chili.",
    "We'll lay that right          in like that.",
    "Let it cook down.",
    "Don't let it burn.",
    "And that can compete  and stand up to that big, uh,",
    "that big Texas chili.              Okay.",
    "Let me get a little     \"S\" and \"P\" into this.",
    "And we'll just let      this go low-and-slow",
    "until it breaks up       that cream cheese.",
    "There we go.              Okay.",
    "Let me talk  about this chili real quick.",
    "The chili, I mean, this has got a super, important role in this",
    "because we can stuff the chili",
    "into these, uh, potato skins.",
    "There's a lot that could happen.",
    "But what I want to do right nowis pour myself an ice cold beer.",
    "I want to get a little bit            of beer,",
    "and I want to get a little bit      of masa, masa harina.",
    "This is what you'd make, uh, tamales or tortillas with.",
    "If you don't have masa,",
    "don't worry about running out         to go grab it.",
    "All you're gonna need to do   is use some regular flour.",
    "But I'm just gonna  cut it a little bit into this",
    "so it doesn't clump up on me",
    "when I drop it in there.",
    "So maybe...    that's 2 big tablespoons.",
    "Okay.",
    "And I also    want to add just a touch.",
    "Whoa.",
    "Did I get that on me?",
    "A little bit of paprika.",
    "There we go.",
    "Excellent.              Okay.",
    "So we're gonna mix this up.  It's kind of dissolved there,",
    "kind of like you're making            a slurry.",
    "You get the idea.",
    "I'm gonna turn that heat       down a little bit.",
    "That thing's rolling hard.",
    "Takes about two hours   for that really to reduce.",
    "We have 2 quarts of beef stock       that went into it.",
    "So we'll just slowly      incorporate this in.",
    "And this is gonna work    as an awesome thickener.",
    "It kind of plays right into the theme of Texas,",
    "and chili and Tex-Mex.",
    "Some nice beer flavor into that.",
    "And, again, no tomatoes,            no beans.",
    "All right. There we go.              Okay.",
    "So this is starting       to melt down nice.",
    "You'll see a nice little cheese    sauce coming out of that.",
    "So while that is melting,",
    "let's get over here   and talk about these skins.",
    "Now, the skins, like I said,",
    "\"You have leftover potatoes.",
    "What are you gonna do           with them?\"",
    "Well, we're gonna take...",
    "Put a little bit of mushroommixture in there with the leeks.",
    "Okay.",
    "We'll peel off...",
    "There you go.           This is...",
    "When you think \"Game Day\"     at my house, you think,",
    "\"Of course,there's gonna be a little brie.\"",
    "So we'll crumble a little brie            in there.",
    "And then, what would be       the next thought --",
    "\"Okay, yeah. Prosciutto.\"",
    "There's gonna besome Italian cold-cuts for sure.",
    "So look at this.          There you go.",
    "Some nice prosciutto,         thinly sliced.",
    "We'll just tear off          a few pieces.",
    "Lay it right up on top.",
    "That'll get nice and crusty,       kind of like bacon.",
    "So I'll knock these out.",
    "Fill 'em up.      Pop 'em in the oven.",
    "Let 'em melt one more time.",
    "Cheese sauce will be done.",
    "The chili's thickening up.",
    "When you come back,         it's game day.",
    "I don't know who's playing,      but it doesn't matter",
    "because this is gonna           be a feast.",
    "See you in a little bit.",
    "Whoa.        Coming over hot.",
    "Look at those bad boys.              Huh?",
    "That's potato skins like you've never seen before.",
    "Cooked these potatoes.",
    "Scooped 'em out.         Deep fried 'em.",
    "Filled 'em with some cremini       mushrooms, some...",
    "And some, uh, leeks.",
    "Then a little brie, of course.     Isn't it tailgate time?",
    "No?    And a little prosciutto.",
    "That's exactly how we do it       at the Fieri house.",
    "Some cheese sauce       made with some beer",
    "and some cheddar   and a little cream cheese.",
    "And then the star of the show --   Let me turn down some heat.",
    "The start of the show --",
    "this true Texas-style chili.",
    "You see that beautiful red hue.",
    "There's no tomatoes in that.        There's no beans.",
    "But there is a mess of hot peppers, fresh peppers.",
    "We got a little bit of garlic.",
    "We got beer.",
    "We got a little masa harina        to tighten it up.",
    "And you take a look at that,      ladies and gentlemen.",
    "Tell me that is not gorgeous.",
    "Fantastic.",
    "Grab one of these bad boys.",
    "Drop it down.",
    "Got myself a cold beer.",
    "I'm just tasting, just doing a little pre-party.",
    "Don't -- don't worry about this.              Okay.",
    "Now, get a little dollop       of some sour cream.",
    "Personally, I'm into, uh,        some red onions.",
    "Oh, you know     what I need back here?",
    "Let me get some chives.",
    "Okay.",
    "Sprinkle those over the top.",
    "And a little scallion.",
    "Not showing off, just hungry.              Okay.",
    "Right on top there.",
    "Excellent.",
    "I get myself a couple crackers.",
    "Drop 'em right on.",
    "This is coming together.       Now, look at that.",
    "All that beautiful red color.",
    "Mm. It's totally missing          something --",
    "cheddar cheese sauce.",
    "What am I thinking?      This is the whole...",
    "This is how I got    the whole party started.",
    "Look at that.",
    "There we go.",
    "So sour cream, the scallions,    the onions, the crackers",
    "and this beautiful red chili  that has no tomato or beans.",
    "Mm.",
    "Deep, rich flavor.",
    "Tighten it up just a little bit         with that masa,",
    "that tortilla flour,         right in there.",
    "Mm.",
    "And the cheese sauce,      man, I'm telling you,",
    "you make that roux.",
    "Get a little bit     of that half-and-half,",
    "but then stopped it and hit the rest of it with that beer,",
    "with that nice little           amber beer,",
    "you're really getting  that cheese to come through.",
    "Mm.",
    "And then, this right here.",
    "I mean, I think      you say potato skin,",
    "people are expecting  that I fill it with the chili",
    "and hit it     with the cheese sauce,",
    "which isn't a bad idea.        But look at this.",
    "Mushrooms, brie, prosciutto.",
    "A little kiss of the leeks    in there, chives on top.",
    "Game day?",
    "It looks like wedding food.            Isn't it?",
    "Well, it depends on the wedding.",

    "some of the probably mostoutrageous game day feasts.",
    "I mean, I've done it all.I've done the nachos.",
    "I've done the tacos.I've done the burgers.",
    "About anything in the worldthat you could ever",
    "imagine to barbecue,I have done right here.",
    "But one of the number-onerequests, you know what it is?",
    "Chili.And not any regular chili.",
    "We're talking Texas-style.",
    "No tomatoes, no beans,real deal Texas-style chili,",
    "and that's what I'm gonnagive you today.",
    "My Texas-style chili is packedwith ground beef, cubed beef,",
    "dried chilies, fresh chilies,onions, garlic, cumin and more.",
    "And it's served with, get this,",
    "a beer cheddar cheese sauce.",
    "Oh, yeah. This is the onethat's guaranteed to score",
    "some major points.Get it?",
    "Game day points.All right.",
    "On the side, how aboutsome elevated potato skins?",
    "I'm upping the gameon this game day classic",
    "with leeks, mushrooms,brie cheese and prosciutto.",
    "And you can bet those are gonnafly off the plate.",
    "In fact, you might wantto make a double batch.",
    "All right.Let's get started.",
    "Dutch oven going hot.",
    "Onions busted down.",
    "A little bit of garlicinto my peppers.",
    "So listen.You're gonna",
    "find your favorite peppersthat you like to work with.",
    "This chiliis not outrageously hot.",
    "So it doesn't mean that youhave to go with the big heat.",
    "But we're gonnause some Anaheims right here.",
    "Okay.And we got a bunch",
    "a bunch of dry chilies thatwe're gonna bust into as well.",
    "Now, I'm gonna cut 'emdown into a pretty usable size.",
    "Actually, let me go ahead anddrop some of these now 'cause",
    "it's gonna take some timeto sweat 'em.",
    "So a little bit of olive oil.",
    "We'll get downwith the onions right now.",
    "And this is, just like I said,",
    "no beans, no tomatoes.",
    "And that's what's funny.",
    "Because when you give peoplechili like this,",
    "they're like, \"Hey, I thinkyou're missing something.",
    "This kind of lookslike a meat sauce.\"",
    "Well, you got to remember...Chili con carne.",
    "Meat and pepper.",
    "Okay.",
    "Drop those down.",
    "A great wayto break this chili down...",
    "Split 'em,",
    "take the seeds, not a lotof membrane inside of here.",
    "That... just the key",
    "is just to make surewe got some uniform sizes.",
    "There we go.",
    "Some red bell.",
    "Okay.",
    "Drop those in.Look at that.",
    "Just sweating up nice.",
    "This Fresno chili here,",
    "I'm not too worriedabout the heat on it.",
    "Pretty mild.",
    "So I'll just give ita couple slices down the front.",
    "And I won't add that garlic yetbecause I don't want it to burn.",
    "And I got a lot of heatgoing in this right now.",
    "So far, so good, huh?",
    "Okay.",
    "Let this continue to sweat down.",
    "Add a little bit of salt to it.",
    "Let's get into dry chilies.",
    "Now, this is reallythe foundation of this chili.",
    "So what we're first starting off",
    "is with some Chile de arbol,which is nice and spicy.",
    "The ancho and Guajillo chile,",
    "which, to me,is my favorite dry chili.",
    "And so the ancho's deepand rich.",
    "The Guajillo's gota nice little spice and kick.",
    "And, of course,the Chile de arbol",
    "has definitely got the heat.",
    "So taking those,",
    "charring 'em is the beginningof this dish.",
    "And, believe it or not, the redcolor that's gonna come out",
    "is gonna be outrageous.",
    "So these will sit hereand toast.",
    "Get a little more heat on that.",
    "There we go.",
    "Let me get this stuffin the compost.",
    "And let's talk about potatoes.",
    "So a lot of peopleshow up for game day feast.",
    "And they're expecting the...The regular old fare.",
    "We're gonnado some potato skins.",
    "Oh, but we're gonna fill 'emwith brie and prosciutto.",
    "Just got to knock it...",
    "You just can't let 'em knowwhat's coming.",
    "Got to give 'em a littlesurprise.",
    "So here is some beautifulbaked Russet potatoes.",
    "So what I'm gonna do.",
    "There's a keyof where I want to slice these.",
    "Okay.If I slice 'em like this,",
    "then I'm gonnaget these really flat boats.",
    "What I want to dois slice 'em on the flat.",
    "Okay.",
    "Like so.",
    "Take 'em on the flat like this,",
    "carve into them,leaving about a 1/4 inch...",
    "Leaving about a 1/4 inch",
    "of the flesh around thereso they don't become too thin.",
    "Because what's gonna happen is,",
    "after I take all this fleshout of them,",
    "let them cool down a bit.",
    "Then I'm gonna deep fry 'em.",
    "What do you think of that?",
    "All right.And the last one.",
    "Now, these potatoesare still a little bit warm,",
    "so I'm gonnalet 'em cool down here a bit.",
    "And you got to savethose potato innards.",
    "I mean,you're talking potato pancakes.",
    "You got all kindsof options there.",
    "All right.So let me do this first.",
    "Um, the Guaji...",
    "The... the peppers over herehave really toasted up nice.",
    "I don't want 'em to burn.",
    "So now, I'm gonna reconstitute'em with just a little bit",
    "of hot water.Okay.",
    "I'm gonnado it right there in that pan.",
    "That is a hot pan.",
    "Little more water.",
    "And we'll just let those kindof hang out for a second.",
    "And those are gonna go directlyinto the chili in just a minute.",
    "Speaking of the chili,I need to get those peppers",
    "and onions out of there",
    "because now I have gotsome top round",
    "that I want to brown off.",
    "And we're talking about...",
    "I don't want itto be interrupted.",
    "I really want to buildsome crust,",
    "kind of like we're searinga short rib.",
    "So what I want to dois get all these out",
    "'cause you leave just a littlebit of this in there,",
    "there's a lot of moisture.",
    "It will keep it from...",
    "It'll keep the meatfrom really browning up.",
    "It's just chasing these aroundinside of here.",
    "There we go.Okay.",
    "Over here.Let that continue to stay hot.",
    "We'll go over here.There's ground beef.",
    "But right now, the roast.",
    "Now, this is a great thing.",
    "We're talking about stew meatright here.",
    "We're talk... Look at that.",
    "Look how beautiful.",
    "Huh?",
    "So we'll just hit itwith a little...",
    "A little touch of some salt.",
    "And we'll just drop it...",
    "Crank that pan back up.",
    "Right back in.",
    "There we go.",
    "Nice little sear gonnahappen to that.",
    "Now, I alsohave some ground beef",
    "that I'll put inin a little bit.",
    "I like to havetwo of the textures.",
    "This is gonnabe really nice and chewy.",
    "It's got some real,great steak-feel to it.",
    "But it will be super tender.",
    "And then, that ground beef.",
    "Well, that just kind of worksits way around all the peppers",
    "and all that saucethat's gonna be happening.",
    "Okay.We'll let that brown up.",
    "Now, the skins.",
    "What's gonna happen with these?",
    "Well, what I'm gonna do is I gota little bit of the texture,",
    "little bit of potatoleft on the inside.",
    "Drop 'em in at about 350.",
    "And here's the beautywith these.",
    "We're gonna stuff 'em.Oh, yeah.",
    "So, I want you to think abouta gigantic hollow french fry",
    "that we're gonna jamsome prosciutto in,",
    "some brie, some mushrooms.",
    "I mean, the list goes on and on.",
    "So let me put these down.You guys come back.",
    "We'll continueto work on the chili.",
    "We got so manybig flavors going on.",
    "And this isall for that big game day feast.",
    "See you in a bit.",
    "So it's game day feast",
    "here at the Fieri house,in the backyard.",
    "And yes, game dayand leeks do go hand-in-hand.",
    "I've got some leeksthat I'm gonna be sautéing,",
    "here in a second,with some cremini mushrooms.",
    "But, uh, I'll show youthis little leek technique.",
    "Remember when the leek grows,it's growing up like this.",
    "So the opportunity for sand",
    "and dirt and everythingto fall down into those crevices",
    "is really,uh, is really, uh, happening.",
    "So what we want to dois I cut mine.",
    "Makes it a littlebit easier to clean.",
    "And then, I'll just give 'ema quick little chop,",
    "drop 'em into the water.",
    "I can swirl 'em aroundwith my hand",
    "and just kind of wash'em like that,",
    "or rinse 'em, I should say.",
    "Some people leave the roundstogether, but what I find is",
    "that if they... the rounds don'tget completely broken apart,",
    "you have a chanceof getting yourself some sand",
    "and some dirt into it.",
    "So this is all gonna cometogether.",
    "Well, I'll just do itwith my hand.",
    "This is all gonna come together",
    "for a fantasticstuffed potato skin.",
    "And, actually, I've got to dropsome of the potato skins.",
    "So let me let this settledown here for a second.",
    "Some baked potatoes just leftwith about a 1/4 inch, uh,",
    "interior right there.",
    "Salted thembefore I roasted 'em.",
    "And we'll drop 'emin 350-degree oil.",
    "And yes,I want these to almost get",
    "like a hollowed-out french fry.",
    "Okay.Almost potato chip-like",
    "because we're gonna be throwingin some brie cheese, prosciutto,",
    "and some mushrooms and all that.",
    "And speaking of which,I need to get",
    "my leeks going here in a second.",
    "So couple tablespoons of butter.",
    "And I'm just gonnashake the leeks off.",
    "Drop 'em in the butter.And I have some ground beef",
    "going over herewith some 1-inch cubes of chuck.",
    "And I cooked those in the oil",
    "that I had just sweatedsome peppers and onions in.",
    "And in we'll go with the leeks.",
    "And then, over there, also,",
    "I have some steeped peppersthat I kind of toasted off a bit",
    "to get nice and,uh, well, nice and rustic",
    "because we're makingTexas-style chili.",
    "No beans and no...And no tomatoes.",
    "Okay.",
    "Drop these in.",
    "Set this aside.",
    "Creminis, my favorite.",
    "I'm telling you,one of my favorite mushrooms.",
    "I can't sayit's absolutely my favorite,",
    "but it definitely is oneof the best.",
    "Really nice and meaty.",
    "Lots of really definedmushroom flavor.",
    "And we're gonna cookthese down with these leeks.",
    "It'll work out perfectly.",
    "All right.That's enough.",
    "Okay.",
    "Bring it right over.Drop these in.",
    "And you knowwhat this needs here?",
    "Is just a little touch of thyme.",
    "I got some fresh thymestanding by.",
    "That's all gonna cookdown together.",
    "Throw a little more heat on it.",
    "And all the thymecomes out together.",
    "And just the leavesof the thyme.",
    "Okay.I know this seems",
    "a little bit more refined thanyou're thinking game day food.",
    "But, you know,when you say potato skin",
    "and then you say, \"But I'mstuffing it with mushrooms,",
    "and brie and prosciutto,\" youcan get away with it.",
    "All right.Now, back over here.",
    "Let's take a look at this.",
    "The meat looks great, gettinga nice little brown to it.",
    "That's what I was tryingto achieve with that is",
    "just get a little crust on it.Okay.",
    "What does it need?",
    "Well, it needs a little bitof this garlic.",
    "I held out on the garlictill the last moment",
    "because I didn't wantit to burn.",
    "And I got to getthese peppers in.",
    "Let's get over to these peppers.",
    "Ow, hot handle.",
    "And I want that liquid and all.",
    "So I have these reconstitutedGuajillos,",
    "Chile de arbol and anchos.",
    "Okay.",
    "Hit that.",
    "Little bit of power.",
    "Puree it.",
    "There we go.",
    "We'll dump this right in hereon with the meat,",
    "in with that garlicthat I just added.",
    "That's where your realflavor's coming from.",
    "So you look at this and yougo, \"Well, it's red like chili,",
    "but there's no tomato in it?\"Nope.",
    "No tomato.",
    "There we go.Let me drop this in.",
    "Sweated peppers and onionsthat we had from earlier.",
    "And that all gets mixedtogether.",
    "Look at that.Look... Just...",
    "I mean, take a look inside this.Now...",
    "Now it's time to go buildanother layer of seasoning.",
    "So I've done some saltand pepper.",
    "Got the peppers and the garlic.",
    "Now we'll do a touchof Cayenne.",
    "A little oregano.",
    "A little bit of cumin.",
    "Got to have a little kissof cinnamon.",
    "Not too much of it.Just a touch.",
    "Now, this all gets mixedtogether",
    "and really gonnabuild a big base flavor.",
    "But I've got to get some liquidin here",
    "to help cook down that meat.",
    "So we'll get in here.",
    "2 quarts of beef stock.We're gonna let this go in here.",
    "It's gonna cook down, believe itor not, for two hours.",
    "So I've got my creminis",
    "and my leeks getting ready to gofor my stuffed potato skins.",
    "And my potato skinsare just finishing up now.",
    "Here's chili.Cheese sauce coming up.",
    "It's game day feast.",

    "Oh, man, I'm telling you,",
    "it's all coming together,finally.",
    "Yes, I'm browning the butter.",
    "That's what you expect to find",
    "on a game day feastat the Fieri house.",
    "Now, I'm actually makingsome roux because I'm gonna",
    "make some beer cheddarcheese sauce for my chili.",
    "So, just a little bit of flourto go with that butter.",
    "Make a quick little roux.",
    "Basically, equal parts.",
    "Let's see where that gets us.",
    "There we go.",
    "Toast it off.There you are.",
    "What do you have back herein this cauldron of fun?",

    "some mushrooms and leeksto go in our stuffed potatoes.",
    "So these are actuallypotato skins.",
    "Took some baked potatoes,scooped 'em out, fried 'em.",
    "Nice and crunchy.Look at that.",
    "Almost like a, uh, crossbetween a hollow french fry",
    "and a potato chip.Gonna go in there.",
    "I'll get to that in a second.",
    "But in the meantime,we need to get a little beer.",
    "Beer cheddar cheese sauce.",
    "I mean, I like a cheese saucelike anybody does,",
    "but when you're gonna make it",
    "and it's standing upagainst big flavors like, uh,",
    "a Texas-style chili, you can'tjust go out of the can",
    "with this one.",
    "So start with a roux,simple 50-50 of fat and flour...",
    "Butter and flour,a little half-and-half.",
    "Not too much half-and-half",
    "'cause we're adding ina full beer.",
    "Nice amber beer so you're gonnaget that deep, rich beer flavor.",
    "Dropping in some sharp cheddar,",
    "grated, slowly,little bit at a time",
    "so it doesn't seize upand get into that cheese ball.",
    "A little touch of Cayenne.",
    "And then,this is where the flavors",
    "get a little bit funky.Dry mustard.",
    "Got to have that little tangin there from the dry mustard.",
    "A little bit of Worcestershire.",
    "A little touch of paprika.There we are.",

    "Get some cream cheese.",
    "I said, \"Game day food.\"I did not say,",
    "\"This is the health show.\"Okay.",
    "So we've got cream cheese.",
    "We got beer.We've got chili.",
    "We'll lay that rightin like that.",
    "Let it cook down.",
    "Don't let it burn.",
    "And that can competeand stand up to that big, uh,",
    "that big Texas chili.Okay.",
    "Let me get a little\"S\" and \"P\" into this.",
    "And we'll just letthis go low-and-slow",
    "until it breaks upthat cream cheese.",
    "There we go.Okay.",
    "Let me talkabout this chili real quick.",
    "The chili, I mean, this has gota super, important role in this",
    "because we can stuff the chili",
    "into these, uh, potato skins.",
    "There's a lot that could happen.",
    "But what I want to do right nowis pour myself an ice cold beer.",
    "I want to get a little bitof beer,",
    "and I want to get a little bitof masa, masa harina.",
    "This is what you'd make,uh, tamales or tortillas with.",
    "If you don't have masa,",
    "don't worry about running outto go grab it.",
    "All you're gonna need to dois use some regular flour.",
    "But I'm just gonnacut it a little bit into this",
    "so it doesn't clump up on me",
    "when I drop it in there.",
    "So maybe...that's 2 big tablespoons.",
    "Okay.",
    "And I alsowant to add just a touch.",
    "Whoa.",
    "Did I get that on me?",
    "A little bit of paprika.",
    "There we go.",
    "Excellent.Okay.",
    "So we're gonna mix this up.It's kind of dissolved there,",
    "kind of like you're makinga slurry.",
    "You get the idea.",
    "I'm gonna turn that heatdown a little bit.",
    "That thing's rolling hard.",
    "Takes about two hoursfor that really to reduce.",
    "We have 2 quarts of beef stockthat went into it.",
    "So we'll just slowlyincorporate this in.",
    "And this is gonna workas an awesome thickener.",
    "It kind of playsright into the theme of Texas,",
    "and chili and Tex-Mex.",
    "Some nice beer flavor into that.",
    "And, again, no tomatoes,no beans.",
    "All right. There we go.Okay.",
    "So this is startingto melt down nice.",
    "You'll see a nice little cheesesauce coming out of that.",
    "So while that is melting,",
    "let's get over hereand talk about these skins.",
    "Now, the skins, like I said,",
    "\"You have leftover potatoes.",
    "What are you gonna dowith them?\"",
    "Well, we're gonna take...",
    "Put a little bit of mushroommixture in there with the leeks.",
    "Okay.",
    "We'll peel off...",
    "There you go.This is...",
    "When you think \"Game Day\"at my house, you think,",
    "\"Of course,there's gonna be a little brie.\"",
    "So we'll crumble a little briein there.",
    "And then, what would bethe next thought...",
    "\"Okay, yeah. Prosciutto.\"",
    "There's gonna besome Italian cold-cuts for sure.",
    "So look at this.There you go.",
    "Some nice prosciutto,thinly sliced.",
    "We'll just tear offa few pieces.",
    "Lay it right up on top.",
    "That'll get nice and crusty,kind of like bacon.",
    "So I'll knock these out.",
    "Fill 'em up.Pop 'em in the oven.",
    "Let 'em melt one more time.",
    "Cheese sauce will be done.",
    "The chili's thickening up.",
    "When you come back,it's game day.",
    "I don't know who's playing,but it doesn't matter",
    "because this is gonnabe a feast.",
    "See you in a little bit.",
    "Whoa.Coming over hot.",
    "Look at those bad boys.Huh?",
    "That's potato skinslike you've never seen before.",
    "Cooked these potatoes.",
    "Scooped 'em out.Deep fried 'em.",
    "Filled 'em with some creminimushrooms, some...",
    "And some, uh, leeks.",
    "Then a little brie, of course.Isn't it tailgate time?",
    "No?And a little prosciutto.",
    "That's exactly how we do itat the Fieri house.",
    "Some cheese saucemade with some beer",
    "and some cheddarand a little cream cheese.",
    "And then the star of the show...Let me turn down some heat.",
    "The start of the show...",
    "This true Texas-style chili.",
    "You see that beautiful red hue.",
    "There's no tomatoes in that.There's no beans.",
    "But there is a messof hot peppers, fresh peppers.",
    "We got a little bit of garlic.",
    "We got beer.",
    "We got a little masa harinato tighten it up.",
    "And you take a look at that,ladies and gentlemen.",
    "Tell me that is not gorgeous.",
    "Fantastic.",
    "Grab one of these bad boys.",
    "Drop it down.",
    "Got myself a cold beer.",
    "I'm just tasting,just doing a little pre-party.",
    "Don't... don't worry about this.Okay.",
    "Now, get a little dollopof some sour cream.",
    "Personally, I'm into, uh,some red onions.",
    "Oh, you knowwhat I need back here?",
    "Let me get some chives.",
    "Okay.",
    "Sprinkle those over the top.",
    "And a little scallion.",
    "Not showing off, just hungry.Okay.",
    "Right on top there.",
    "Excellent.",
    "I get myself a couple crackers.",
    "Drop 'em right on.",
    "This is coming together.Now, look at that.",
    "All that beautiful red color.",
    "Mm. It's totally missingsomething...",
    "Cheddar cheese sauce.",
    "What am I thinking?This is the whole...",
    "This is how I gotthe whole party started.",
    "Look at that.",
    "There we go.",
    "So sour cream, the scallions,the onions, the crackers",
    "and this beautiful red chilithat has no tomato or beans.",
    "Mm.",
    "Deep, rich flavor.",
    "Tighten it up just a little bitwith that masa,",
    "that tortilla flour,right in there.",
    "Mm.",
    "And the cheese sauce,man, I'm telling you,",
    "you make that roux.",
    "Get a little bitof that half-and-half,",
    "but then stopped it and hitthe rest of it with that beer,",
    "with that nice littleamber beer,",
    "you're really gettingthat cheese to come through.",
    "Mm.",
    "And then, this right here.",
    "I mean, I thinkyou say potato skin,",
    "people are expectingthat I fill it with the chili",
    "and hit itwith the cheese sauce,",
    "which isn't a bad idea.But look at this.",
    "Mushrooms, brie, prosciutto.",
    "A little kiss of the leeksin there, chives on top.",
    "Game day?",
    "It looks like wedding food.Isn't it?",
    "Well, it depends on the wedding.",
    "Listen.You want to get this recipe?",
    "'Cause I know you do.",
    "You know the deal...Foodnetwork.com/guysbigbite.",
    "Hanging out in the backyard,and I'll see you next week.",
    "You know, when you think about     what you're gonna give",
    "for Valentine's Day, everybody    says you give chocolates.",
    "But me, uh, I'm not much    of a dessert, sweets guy.",
    "So I don't know a box ofchocolates for me is gonna work.",
    "But I do agree.",
    "You gotta give chocolate       on Valentine's Day.",
    "So mine'll be inside of a dish.        That's the idea,",
    "starting off with my grilled chicken mole negro.",
    "Coated in a smoky chile rub,",
    "grilled and served     with a dark mole sauce,",
    "deeply flavoredwith dried chiles and chocolate.",
    "I mean, this makes  the perfect Valentine's Day.",
    "Now I've also got a hominy with pomegranate and cilantro,",
    "fortified with black beans and  a citrus tequila vinaigrette.",
    "So that's it. We got, uh,     chicken and chocolate,",
    "and we got tequila       and salad dressing.",
    "I know it sounds crazy,       but, uh, trust me.",
    "You're gonna love this.     So stoking up the fire,",
    "getting it ready because we  are gonna grill some chicken.",
    "And the sauce    that's gonna go with it,",
    "I'm not kidding you,     is gonna knock you out.",
    "So let's talk about this sauce.",
    "Let's talk about this, uh, mole.",
    "Now mole's kinda like sayin'     to somebody, uh, \"Yeah.",
    "I've got a great --     I've got a great salsa.",
    "Or I got a great curry. Or I got    a great barbecue sauce.\"",
    "Moles are those kinda recipes",
    "that have been passed down  through the family for years.",
    "So as I'm explaining this, I'm trying to open this pepper.",
    "Um, what is it?",
    "Well, there's a lot   of different styles of it.",
    "This is gonna be a dark mole.",
    "And typically,   what would that have in it?",
    "Exactly.         Some chocolate.",
    "So in this dark mole,",
    "we're gonna start off here   with a little ancho chile.",
    "This was picked at its peak    of ripeness, then dried.",
    "And you're gonna get  this really nice, dark, rich,",
    "almost like cherry         and chocolate.",
    "I mean, fantastic. So we're gonna toast these off.",
    "About four of each.",
    "All right.    So some of the anchos in.",
    "Now let's get my favorite.   This is the guajillo. Okay.",
    "Take these seeds          and stems out",
    "because we don't   want the stems particularly",
    "or too many of the seeds 'cause",
    "there's inherently    gonna be a few in there.",
    "Tear these up.         Toast 'em off.",
    "I got some boiling water     to reconstitute these.",
    "And they'll be going         into this mole.",
    "Okay.   So we'll drop all these in",
    "and let that hang out.",
    "And I'm -- Not raging heat.",
    "You can just see it starting     to smoke a little bit.",
    "And I'm touching it. And if you   don't wanna do it that way,",
    "just get the tongs out.",
    "Just move 'em      around a little bit.",
    "Don't want 'em to burn, but we   do want 'em to toast. Okay?",
    "And they're almost there.",
    "You can see how they've really      started to darken up.",
    "There was the original color --     kind of a reddish hue.",
    "There's the toasted color.  Okay? So we're almost there.",
    "Just about another minute or so.           All right.",
    "While that's workin',    let's talk about hominy.",
    "Listen. I had this buddy        when I was a kid,",
    "and he was such a hominy            fanatic.",
    "I had never had hominy before.         Or maybe I had.",
    "But he used to love hominy   any way he could get it --",
    "if he could get it cooked,",
    "if he could get it cold           in a salad.",
    "And that was the first timeI think I really ever went, \"Oh.",
    "Wait a second.       I like this stuff.\"",
    "Now this is dried hominy.",
    "If you can go    from the dried corn and,",
    "uh, cook 'em yourself,",
    "you're just gonna      get a better texture.",
    "So these have been soakin'       for about 24 hours.",
    "I'll dump it in.  And this is going to make --",
    "I know this is gonna sound --",
    "We'll call it a slaw salsa.",
    "A slaw salsa.  This is gonna be part salsa,",
    "part salad, all from the hominy.",
    "I'll double the water on it.          There we go.",
    "You're gonna let those cook  till they're nice and tender.",
    "And speaking of nice     and tender and cooking,",
    "that's just about enough there.",
    "'Kay.",
    "This is gonna -- You don't have     to do it in a cast iron",
    "if you don't want to.",
    "I like it because it's not gonna         stain the pan.",
    "Uh, non-stick would not be           your choice",
    "on this to toast these.",
    "Just enough water.      We'll let 'em steep.",
    "Matter of fact, I can even  take 'em off the heat 'cause",
    "the work has been done.",
    "That hot pan, that hot water,       those hot chiles...",
    "They're gonna steep    and get nice and pliable.",
    "We'll be able to work with 'em.              Okay?",
    "Let me get some heat           under this.",
    "Uh, let's talk       about the chicken.",
    "All right.",
    "The key here is free-range.",
    "I'm a big fan of chicken.",
    "I'm a big fan of anything that's  in that free-range attitude.",
    "No hormones, no antibiotics.",
    "The great thing   about a free-range chicken",
    "is it's had a chanceto not live in a cage but go out",
    "and work and be a chicken,           all right?",
    "And build --     And there's something.",
    "I mean, that just does flavor.  You got that chicken moving.",
    "You got that chicken    finding things, foraging.",
    "There's just gotta be --      Well, that all works",
    "into the development  of the flavor of the chicken.",
    "So my butcher --  gotta have a good butcher --",
    "...broke it down to me       into eight pieces.",
    "Look at that.",
    "Eight beautiful pieces,        no feet included.",
    "And we're gonna make    a little dry rub for it.",
    "So let me get a bowl.",
    "Got a nice fire going  with some briquette charcoal,",
    "some lump charcoal and then I     threw on some hard oak.",
    "Wanna get a little bit          of that smoky",
    "wood flavor coming into this.",
    "So we'll start off  with just a touch of cayenne,",
    "little cracked black pepper,",
    "little more kosher salt,",
    "granulated garlic,",
    "a little chipotle         chile powder...",
    "a little ancho chile powder.",
    "There we go.",
    "The cumin.",
    "Okay. Now that chipotle   and the ancho, why the two?",
    "Looking for a little bit more heat coming from that chipotle.",
    "You had the cayenne. Of course     that's really big heat.",
    "Then we'll go to the chipotle,         then the ancho.",
    "All right. Mix this up.",
    "And what I'm gonna do --",
    "And this really goes back   to the old-school methods.",
    "I'm gonna season this          ahead of time",
    "and just let this sit herefor a second out on the counter.",
    "Remember,    this is all the bone in.",
    "We'll get some great color        out of this rub.",
    "Look at that.",
    "Great way to start      this whole thing off.",
    "Now you can get the whole        chicken yourself",
    "and break it down.",
    "But this just gets right          to the point.",
    "Give this a little rub,          little flip.",
    "Okay. One more.",
    "And then enough     to get the other side.",
    "So here's what's happenin'.",
    "We're, um,sharing our Valentine's Day love",
    "with a little chocolate.",
    "It's just gonna happen to be",
    "in a dish served   over some chicken with, uh,",
    "a funky hominy slaw.",
    "Oh, you're gonna love this.     Write it down for sure.",
    "See ya in a minute.",
    "You know, I wish I had an intro song coming back in to like...",
    "You know, something like that.",
    "Do you guys     have a song like that?",
    "Would you send it my way?      I'd love to see that.",
    "Well, welcome      to \"Guy's Big Bite.\"",
    "We're still back here       in the kitchen, uh,",
    "making Valentine's Day           happiness.",
    "Uh, yes, there will be chocolate     coming into this dish.",
    "I do not put chocolate           in the box.",
    "That's just not my style.      So what am I making?",
    "I'm making some fantastic --         Well, not yet.",
    "But it'll be  a grilled chicken mole negro.",
    "So busting down some onions right now for this mole sauce.",
    "And I have some peppers steeping           over here.",
    "Got some ancho in there,         which is gonna",
    "give some really nice, deep,  rich tones of pepper and then",
    "a little bit of that spiciness         coming through",
    "from the guajillo.",
    "I toasted those off       just a second ago.",
    "Now they're steeping        in the hot water.",
    "There we go.        Some onions done.",
    "Let me pop a little bit           of garlic,",
    "give this a quick little dice",
    "and into the food processor            we'll go.",
    "And this is where we're gonna       start the beginning",
    "of this, uh, mole.",
    "Now as I said, moles, well,everybody's got a recipe for it.",
    "Or a lot of, uh, you know,   a lot of my Latino friends,",
    "their family has it.",
    "And so trying to get one of       these from somebody",
    "is kinda like trying    to get the family secret.",
    "Um, let me see here.",
    "This is hot.",
    "There we go.              Okay.",
    "So we want the peppers and about a cup of the liquid.",
    "Okay.   Little bit of that pepper,",
    "steeping water.",
    "I'll just go    over the old-school way.",
    "I'm in the outdoor kitchen.   I can drag it over the top",
    "of everything.",
    "So we get the onions in.",
    "Now comes a whole host        of ingredients --",
    "Mexican oregano, cloves,",
    "cinnamon and sesame seeds.            Oh, yeah.",
    "Toasted sesame seeds.           Absolutely.",
    "There's gonna be some more nuts    in this in just a second.",
    "Little toasted sesame seed.",
    "Mexican oregano.",
    "You hear me talk about it   on \"Big Bite\" all the time.",
    "Big, big oregano flavor.",
    "And we'll do     a little ground clove.",
    "This is just a touch.",
    "There we go.",
    "Just a touch of some cinnamon.              Yes.",
    "And it does have those tones --",
    "the cinnamon,    the chocolate, the sugar.",
    "Okay.          There we go.",
    "Now these are the two           ingredients",
    "that you're probably gonna  look at me and say, \"Really?",
    "That's in a mole?\"",
    "And it's going to be, uh-huh,",
    "slivered almonds and raisins.",
    "I know.             I know.",
    "Don't shoot the messenger.",
    "But you're gonna dig this.",
    "So we'll get in some raisins.",
    "And that -- You know,    raisins have that real --",
    "that distinct, sweet, um, like,",
    "like, dark brown sugar kinda         flavor to 'em.",
    "That's why they     play into this so well.",
    "And then the almonds'll create some really nice texture to it.",
    "And again, you're wantingto think, \"Where was this made?\"",
    "We're talking about         down in Mexico.",
    "We're talkin'     about what ingredients,",
    "what was available down there.",
    "Dried nuts    definitely play into it.",
    "Okay.       This is the one --",
    "this is the one that's gonna     take some explanation.",
    "This is brown sugar.",
    "The Mexican sugar that looks like it's in a cone.",
    "And this is unrefined.",
    "So this isn't a white sugar   with molasses added to it.",
    "This is an unrefined          Mexican sugar",
    "that has a really nice, richmolasses smell and flavor to it.",
    "And it's called piloncillo.",
    "There we go.",
    "Just depends on      how dried out it got.",
    "Okay.       All that together.",
    "And one last thing -- a little      bit of chicken stock.",
    "Let me get my heat up       on this Dutch oven.",
    "Why the Dutch oven?              Okay.",
    "That's a really good question.",
    "The Dutch oven because you     gotta think about this.",
    "We got some --we got some sweet going into it.",
    "We even have more sweet         going into it.",
    "And this is gonna        go low and slow.",
    "And nothing worse     than going low and slow",
    "and burning it becauseyou're not keeping an eye on it.",
    "So these old Dutch ovens,    that was kind of the, uh,",
    "the idea  is to have enough insulation",
    "that it wasn't gonna burn,              okay?",
    "This...",
    "Eh, it comes out the sides.",
    "Don't worry about that.      Clean that up later.",
    "It's a really nice look, though.",
    "Awesome.",
    "There we go.",
    "All right.         You know what?",
    "I gotta set this down 'cause I'm forgetting one key ingredient.",
    "Let's talk about lard.",
    "Now lard --         What are we t--",
    "So -- So here's      some pig fat for ya.",
    "Now here's something    you're not gonna believe.",
    "If I told you that this had less saturated fat than butter,",
    "would you believe me?",
    "Well, you should 'cause          it's my show.",
    "I'm telling you the truth.        Less than butter.",
    "And here's the beauty           about this.",
    "This right here,  we're talking tons of flavor.",
    "Now this isn't just bacon fat.    That's not what this is.",
    "This doesn't have a lot        of flavor to it.",
    "In the Latin world of food, what  were they using to cook with?",
    "Well, pigs are abundant.      They're sustainable.",
    "The Italians and the Greeks,      we had the olive oil.",
    "And the French,      you have the butter.",
    "Well, in Mexico,      you got the pig fat.",
    "All right.       So that cooks down.",
    "It's gonna bubble just a bit.",
    "There we go.",
    "Awesome.",
    "Okay.",
    "Give this a little stir.               Oh!",
    "You should smell the flavors      right off the bat --",
    "raisins, sugar, cinnamon,  nutmeg coming right through.",
    "But don't worry.    This is not a sweet dish.",
    "This is savory.",
    "Okay.",
    "Done there.",
    "Now let's get the chicken down.   Uh, mole... I'm telling ya.",
    "So many ingredients,    I gotta remember 'em all.",
    "Look at the chicken.  Made a nice, little dry rub.",
    "We've got some salt     and pepper, of course.",
    "Then we've got    a little chipotle powder,",
    "little ancho chile powder,  little cayenne, little cumin,",
    "of course.",
    "Look at this.            Bone in.",
    "Nice, big bird too.",
    "I mean, that is a real-deal-size bird.",
    "So what I'm gonna do is        let this get hot.",
    "I've already oiled the grate, flip it over, charred the skin.",
    "But this -- See, a lot of times    you wanna see the chicken",
    "go into the mole, and that's   how it would cook together.",
    "Me, I want a little bit         of this crust,",
    "a little bit of this char,",
    "a little more of  this California-style to it.",
    "So we'll grill the chicken,",
    "get it done    and add it with the mole.",
    "So here's the last thing      I got -- the hominy.",
    "I haven't even talked           about that.",
    "Oh. It is gonna be this       hominy slaw salsa.",
    "Beans are gonna go in there.  Pomegranate's going in there.",
    "So what I've gotta do --  Look. We're just about done.",
    "Check that out.",
    "I'll drain this,    drain and wash my beans.",
    "You come back. We'll keep putting it together.",
    "And I gotta keep an eye          on the mole.",
    "So I'll see you in a little bit.               Mm.",
    "Huh? Look at that.",
    "Steaming hot hominy.",
    "Don't hear that every day.",
    "Oh, that's fantastic.",
    "We're doing this whole         Valentine's Day",
    "cookin' with chocolate.",
    "But I say mole,",
    "and I think hominy.        I don't know why.",
    "But talking of mole,          look at this.",
    "A beautiful, deep, dark,    rich mole that's gonna go",
    "with this grilled chicken     that I have over here.",
    "Really nice, um, Mexican theme        going to it. Oh.",
    "We've got everything from slivered almonds, brown sugar,",
    "raisins, spices, guajillo, ancho chiles in there, onions,",
    "garlic, a little chicken stock.",
    "Speaking of chicken stock,          I need to get",
    "a little bit more in there.",
    "Just getting a touch too thick.",
    "And I'm trying to keep         that heat down.",
    "And what's the star        of a great mole?",
    "Exactly.       A little chocolate.",
    "Now this is   the Mexican-style chocolate",
    "you'll find in the markets.",
    "What I'm gonna do is...",
    "I'm gonna try to break it here       if I don't break --",
    "There we go.",
    "That and...there we go.",
    "Give it a little grate.     But I'll ya something.",
    "As much time as this is    gonna spend here working,",
    "I'm just gonna    throw the whole thing in.",
    "But I'll do this just so I kinda    follow some of the rules.",
    "Hey. Look over there.              Okay.",
    "You were gonna do it         anyways, right?",
    "So that chocolate's not just       regular chocolate.",
    "It's not overly sweet.",
    "But it's got a little bit of a,",
    "like,  a little cinnamon undertone,",
    "little nutmeg to it.",
    "So we'll let this just sit here         and cook down.",
    "And again, with time, this just    becomes really luxurious.",
    "Remember, we got a little bit           of manteca,",
    "we got a little pork fat            in there.",
    "Fantastic.              Okay.",
    "Hominy's done.        Beans are rinsed.",
    "Let's get into some chicken.",
    "Now this chicken    has a nice dry rub on it.",
    "And it's a free-range bird.",
    "Big, beautiful breast          right there.",
    "Skin on, bone in,      all kinds of flavor.",
    "And we got the wings as well.",
    "So we'll throw this right          into the oven",
    "right around 350 degrees.",
    "Okay?",
    "Tuck it right around the corner.",
    "Voilà.",
    "Okay. Hominy.",
    "Okay.   Let's get into the hominy.",
    "Let me get rid       of this chocolate.",
    "Let's --     I did a little zesting.",
    "And this is always   such a boring part of this,",
    "but it's so critical,",
    "because if you wanna really get   that awesome citrus flavor,",
    "you're gonna   have to do a little zesting",
    "without getting all that acid.",
    "So first we'll go in with lime        and orange zest.",
    "And this is gonna     be this dressing for --",
    "What should I call it?      I called it a slaw --",
    "slaw salsa?",
    "Something along those lines.",
    "That's exactly what it is.",
    "It's part slaw, part salsa because we're using the hominy,",
    "but we're also using the beans.",
    "So these are all gonna come            together.",
    "And I'll show you the key  ingredient here in a second,",
    "which you're gonna love this.",
    "'Cause you're thinking        Valentine's Day.",
    "Of course    you're thinking tequila.",
    "Little bit of juice.",
    "Lime juice in here.",
    "Okay.       So the juice is in.",
    "How about a little        red chile flake?",
    "Touch of some cumin.",
    "Now we got acid in here.",
    "We got a little bit of spice.",
    "What do we need next?   going with a little agave.",
    "So a little sweetness          of the agave.",
    "You know what?        Valentine's Day.",
    "Eh -- tequila.        We need tequila.",
    "I think that says -- that's --",
    "Nothing says \"I love you\"     like a little tequila.",
    "There's something      about the combination",
    "of tequila, lime and agave.",
    "A little sweetness,        a little tequila",
    "and a little lime...",
    "Uh, I think they call        that a margarita.",
    "So when you're almost making      a margarita dressing,",
    "it just kinda   triggers a natural memory.",
    "So -- and it works great.     And it's not overdone.",
    "But it's that little bite of   that tequila, a little bit",
    "of that fresh lime juice and a little bit of that agave",
    "that works so well together           in a drink,",
    "work perfect in a dressing.",
    "Oh. I'm gonna tell ya something --",
    "The zest does everything.",
    "One last key,     super-key ingredient --",
    "It's the pomegranate.       I went to Croatia.",
    "I saw pomegranate trees       growing everywhere.",
    "And I will tell ya something --",
    "I've always been a fan        of pomegranates.",
    "I didn't know exactly what they",
    "looked like on the tree,     but they were awesome.",
    "So here's my little technique to get these pomegranates out.",
    "Just take 'em.I think everybody uses this one.",
    "Hit it with the wooden spoon.",
    "Knock 'em out.           That's it.",
    "So I'm gonna add the beans,         uh, the hominy.",
    "You got the pomegranates.          Mole's done.",
    "Gotta fix the chicken 'cause       it's gonna burn up.",
    "And you come back, and I'm gonna       put it all together",
    "on a nice platter.",
    "It's gonna look fantastic.        See ya in a bit.",
    "Welcome back.           All right.",
    "So I'm just puttin'       this all together.",
    "Still thinkin'     about that theme song.",
    "I'm thinking maybe        some soft piano.",
    "Not s-- No, I agree.       Not so much. Okay.",
    "So some cilantro        and some onions,",
    "some scallions ready to go.",
    "Chicken is just finishing up          in the oven.",
    "Let's grab this.       I had to cover it.",
    "You know, sometimes     with a wood-fired oven,",
    "things get a little crazy            in here.",
    "And, uh, well worth it  because take a look at that.",
    "Gorgeous.            Gorgeous.",
    "Gorgeous.",
    "There we go.",
    "Bring it over.",
    "Now the mole sauce -- Oh!",
    "This is -- I mean, this is really coming together.",
    "Nothing says \"I love you\"           like mole.",
    "Well, I don't know.     You put that in a box,",
    "someone would be really, really scared what you're giving them.",
    "But here's what we've got.",
    "It's really cooked down         nice and silky.",
    "We've got chocolate in there.",
    "We've got, uh,some ancho chile, some chipotle,",
    "a little guajillo pepper,        almonds, raisins.",
    "Oh, the raisins --        I'm telling you,",
    "that's one of my favorite parts            about it.",
    "Okay.",
    "Now let's drop this chicken         right on here.",
    "Look at that.",
    "Nestle it right in there.",
    "Beautiful, isn't it?",
    "And the chicken     has a dry rub on it --",
    "salt and pepper, of course,",
    "little cumin,     little chipotle powder.",
    "Right inside.       What do you think?",
    "And I'm just gonna give  these all just a little kiss",
    "of some sauce.",
    "Oh. This is gorgeous.",
    "This is -- Well, they say     you're supposed to give",
    "chocolate for Valentine's Day.",
    "I'm doing it.       I'm just giving it",
    "a different form   than you'd usually expect.",
    "Okay.    This guy on top of that.",
    "Look at that.      Isn't that beautiful?",
    "And you know what?  This is kind of a quick mole.",
    "I'll be honest with you.   This one'll go pretty fast.",
    "You can get this done in 45 minutes or so.",
    "But not to saythat it lacks in flavor one bit.",
    "All right. There we are.",
    "Let me get this outta my way.",
    "And let's get to this slaw,        this slaw salsa.",
    "Now drain the beans,          black beans.",
    "Check this out.",
    "Got a little pomegranate in there, a little orange zest,",
    "a little lime zest,",
    "tequila, agave,     a little bit of cumin.",
    "The beans go in.",
    "The hominy --     Started this from dry.",
    "Boiled it a little bit.       Little bit of salt.",
    "It's tender,      but it's got texture.",
    "Drop that in.",
    "Grab a little more        of the cilantro.",
    "Just kinda give it a little   rough tear right into that.",
    "Mm.     And this vinaigrette --",
    "I mean, come on.       Look at the beans.",
    "Look at the beautiful           pomegranate",
    "just poppin' through.",
    "Touch of some salt.",
    "And you know what the great      thing about this is?",
    "Is this is gonna eat          like a salsa.",
    "It goes right alongside.",
    "But then it's nice and rich    with the beans in there,",
    "so it'll be kind of a salad       alongside of that.",
    "Oh.",
    "Gotta get a bite of this.",
    "Tender beans, little snap,",
    "just a little pop of        that pomegranate,",
    "the big chew coming through from  that hominy, the vinaigrette,",
    "the tequila shining  right through, little agave,",
    "little kiss of the sweetness.",
    "I gotta serve this        all up for my mom",
    "and for Lori, get this ready.",
    "But I'm just going to --           All right.",
    "For responsibility's sake,         I need to just,",
    "you know, kinda break into this.",
    "I mean, I'm not having --  I'm not eating ahead of time.",
    "I just wanna make sure that Loriand my mom are getting the best.",
    "Don't tell anybody.",
    "Oh! That's exactly      what I wanted to do!",
    "Grill the chicken,",
    "give it its own texture,        its own identity,",
    "and then add that awesome mole.",
    "So many times    you'll find that chicken",
    "cooked in the sauce.",
    "It's great.       Don't get me wrong.",
    "But this has another layer.      This has some crunch.",
    "This is -- Oh!   This is what you wanna do.",
    "Foodnetwork.com/guys-big-bite.",

    "So I don't know a box ofchocolates for me is gonna work.",
    "But I do agree.",
    "You gotta give chocolate       on Valentine's Day.",

    "And the sauce    that's gonna go with it,",
    "I'm not kidding you,     is gonna knock you out.",
    "So let's talk about this sauce.",
    "Let's talk about this, uh, mole.",
    "Now mole's kinda like sayin'     to somebody, uh, \"Yeah.",
    "I've got a great --     I've got a great salsa.",
    "Or I got a great curry. Or I got    a great barbecue sauce.\"",
    "Moles are those kinda recipes",
    "that have been passed down  through the family for years.",
    "So as I'm explaining this, I'm trying to open this pepper.",
    "Um, what is it?",
    "Well, there's a lot   of different styles of it.",
    "This is gonna be a dark mole.",
    "And typically,   what would that have in it?",
    "Exactly.         Some chocolate.",
    "So in this dark mole,",
    "we're gonna start off here   with a little ancho chile.",
    "This was picked at its peak    of ripeness, then dried.",
    "And you're gonna get  this really nice, dark, rich,",
    "almost like cherry         and chocolate.",
    "I mean, fantastic. So we're gonna toast these off.",
    "About four of each.",
    "All right.    So some of the anchos in.",
    "Now let's get my favorite.   This is the guajillo. Okay.",
    "Take these seeds          and stems out",
    "because we don't   want the stems particularly",
    "or too many of the seeds 'cause",
    "there's inherently    gonna be a few in there.",
    "Tear these up.         Toast 'em off.",
    "I got some boiling water     to reconstitute these.",
    "And they'll be going         into this mole.",
    "Okay.   So we'll drop all these in",
    "and let that hang out.",
    "And I'm -- Not raging heat.",
    "You can just see it starting     to smoke a little bit.",
    "And I'm touching it. And if you   don't wanna do it that way,",
    "just get the tongs out.",
    "Just move 'em      around a little bit.",
    "Don't want 'em to burn, but we   do want 'em to toast. Okay?",
    "And they're almost there.",
    "You can see how they've really      started to darken up.",
    "There was the original color --     kind of a reddish hue.",
    "There's the toasted color.  Okay? So we're almost there.",
    "Just about another minute or so.           All right.",
    "While that's workin',    let's talk about hominy.",
    "Listen. I had this buddy        when I was a kid,",
    "and he was such a hominy            fanatic.",
    "I had never had hominy before.         Or maybe I had.",
    "But he used to love hominy   any way he could get it --",
    "if he could get it cooked,",
    "if he could get it cold           in a salad.",
    "And that was the first timeI think I really ever went, \"Oh.",
    "Wait a second.       I like this stuff.\"",
    "Now this is dried hominy.",
    "If you can go    from the dried corn and,",
    "uh, cook 'em yourself,",
    "you're just gonna      get a better texture.",
    "So these have been soakin'       for about 24 hours.",
    "I'll dump it in.  And this is going to make --",
    "I know this is gonna sound --",
    "We'll call it a slaw salsa.",
    "A slaw salsa.  This is gonna be part salsa,",
    "part salad, all from the hominy.",
    "I'll double the water on it.          There we go.",
    "You're gonna let those cook  till they're nice and tender.",
    "And speaking of nice     and tender and cooking,",
    "that's just about enough there.",
    "'Kay.",
    "This is gonna -- You don't have     to do it in a cast iron",
    "if you don't want to.",
    "I like it because it's not gonna         stain the pan.",
    "Uh, non-stick would not be           your choice",
    "on this to toast these.",
    "Just enough water.      We'll let 'em steep.",
    "Matter of fact, I can even  take 'em off the heat 'cause",
    "the work has been done.",
    "That hot pan, that hot water,       those hot chiles...",
    "They're gonna steep    and get nice and pliable.",
    "We'll be able to work with 'em.              Okay?",
    "Let me get some heat           under this.",
    "Uh, let's talk       about the chicken.",
    "All right.",
    "The key here is free-range.",
    "I'm a big fan of chicken.",
    "I'm a big fan of anything that's  in that free-range attitude.",
    "No hormones, no antibiotics.",
    "The great thing   about a free-range chicken",
    "is it's had a chanceto not live in a cage but go out",
    "and work and be a chicken,           all right?",
    "And build --     And there's something.",
    "I mean, that just does flavor.  You got that chicken moving.",
    "You got that chicken    finding things, foraging.",
    "There's just gotta be --      Well, that all works",
    "into the development  of the flavor of the chicken.",
    "So my butcher --  gotta have a good butcher --",
    "...broke it down to me       into eight pieces.",
    "Look at that.",
    "Eight beautiful pieces,        no feet included.",
    "And we're gonna make    a little dry rub for it.",
    "So let me get a bowl.",
    "Got a nice fire going  with some briquette charcoal,",
    "some lump charcoal and then I     threw on some hard oak.",
    "Wanna get a little bit          of that smoky",
    "wood flavor coming into this.",
    "So we'll start off  with just a touch of cayenne,",
    "little cracked black pepper,",
    "little more kosher salt,",
    "granulated garlic,",
    "a little chipotle         chile powder...",
    "a little ancho chile powder.",
    "There we go.",
    "The cumin.",
    "Okay. Now that chipotle   and the ancho, why the two?",
    "Looking for a little bit more heat coming from that chipotle.",
    "You had the cayenne. Of course     that's really big heat.",
    "Then we'll go to the chipotle,         then the ancho.",
    "All right. Mix this up.",
    "And what I'm gonna do --",
    "And this really goes back   to the old-school methods.",
    "I'm gonna season this          ahead of time",
    "and just let this sit herefor a second out on the counter.",
    "Remember,    this is all the bone in.",
    "We'll get some great color        out of this rub.",
    "Look at that.",
    "Great way to start      this whole thing off.",
    "Now you can get the whole        chicken yourself",
    "and break it down.",
    "But this just gets right          to the point.",
    "Give this a little rub,          little flip.",
    "Okay. One more.",
    "And then enough     to get the other side.",
    "So here's what's happenin'.",
    "We're, um,sharing our Valentine's Day love",

    "Toasted sesame seeds.           Absolutely.",
    "There's gonna be some more nuts    in this in just a second.",
    "Little toasted sesame seed.",
    "Mexican oregano.",
    "You hear me talk about it   on \"Big Bite\" all the time.",
    "Big, big oregano flavor.",
    "And we'll do     a little ground clove.",
    "This is just a touch.",
    "There we go.",
    "Just a touch of some cinnamon.              Yes.",
    "And it does have those tones --",
    "the cinnamon,    the chocolate, the sugar.",
    "Okay.          There we go.",
    "Now these are the two           ingredients",
    "that you're probably gonna  look at me and say, \"Really?",
    "That's in a mole?\"",
    "And it's going to be, uh-huh,",
    "slivered almonds and raisins.",
    "I know.             I know.",
    "Don't shoot the messenger.",
    "But you're gonna dig this.",
    "So we'll get in some raisins.",
    "And that -- You know,    raisins have that real --",
    "that distinct, sweet, um, like,",
    "like, dark brown sugar kinda         flavor to 'em.",
    "That's why they     play into this so well.",
    "And then the almonds'll create some really nice texture to it.",
    "And again, you're wantingto think, \"Where was this made?\"",
    "We're talking about         down in Mexico.",
    "We're talkin'     about what ingredients,",
    "what was available down there.",
    "Dried nuts    definitely play into it.",
    "Okay.       This is the one --",
    "this is the one that's gonna     take some explanation.",
    "This is brown sugar.",
    "The Mexican sugar that looks like it's in a cone.",
    "And this is unrefined.",
    "So this isn't a white sugar   with molasses added to it.",
    "This is an unrefined          Mexican sugar",
    "that has a really nice, richmolasses smell and flavor to it.",
    "And it's called piloncillo.",
    "There we go.",
    "Just depends on      how dried out it got.",
    "Okay.       All that together.",
    "And one last thing -- a little      bit of chicken stock.",
    "Let me get my heat up       on this Dutch oven.",
    "Why the Dutch oven?              Okay.",
    "That's a really good question.",
    "The Dutch oven because you     gotta think about this.",
    "We got some --we got some sweet going into it.",
    "We even have more sweet         going into it.",
    "And this is gonna        go low and slow.",
    "And nothing worse     than going low and slow",
    "and burning it becauseyou're not keeping an eye on it.",
    "So these old Dutch ovens,    that was kind of the, uh,",
    "the idea  is to have enough insulation",
    "that it wasn't gonna burn,              okay?",
    "This...          [ Whirring ]",
    "Eh, it comes out the sides.",
    "Don't worry about that.      Clean that up later.",
    "It's a really nice look, though.",
    "Awesome. [ Laughs ]",
    "There we go.",
    "All right.         You know what?",
    "I gotta set this down 'cause I'm forgetting one key ingredient.",
    "Let's talk about lard.",
    "Now lard --         What are we t--",
    "So -- So here's      some pig fat for ya.",
    "Now here's something    you're not gonna believe.",
    "If I told you that this had less saturated fat than butter,",
    "would you believe me?",
    "Well, you should 'cause          it's my show.",
    "I'm telling you the truth.        Less than butter.",
    "And here's the beauty           about this.",
    "This right here,  we're talking tons of flavor.",
    "Now this isn't just bacon fat.    That's not what this is.",
    "This doesn't have a lot        of flavor to it.",
    "In the Latin world of food, what  were they using to cook with?",
    "Well, pigs are abundant.      They're sustainable.",
    "The Italians and the Greeks,      we had the olive oil.",
    "And the French,      you have the butter.",
    "Well, in Mexico,      you got the pig fat.",
    "All right.       So that cooks down.",
    "It's gonna bubble just a bit.",
    "There we go.",
    "Awesome.",
    "Okay.",
    "Give this a little stir.               Oh!",
    "You should smell the flavors      right off the bat --",
    "raisins, sugar, cinnamon,  nutmeg coming right through.",
    "But don't worry.    This is not a sweet dish.",
    "This is savory.",
    "Okay.",
    "Done there.",
    "Now let's get the chicken down.   Uh, mole... I'm telling ya.",
    "So many ingredients,    I gotta remember 'em all.",
    "Look at the chicken.  Made a nice, little dry rub.",
    "We've got some salt     and pepper, of course.",
    "Then we've got    a little chipotle powder,",
    "little ancho chile powder,  little cayenne, little cumin,",
    "of course.",
    "Look at this.            Bone in.",
    "Nice, big bird too.",
    "I mean, that is a real-deal-size bird.",
    "So what I'm gonna do is        let this get hot.",
    "I've already oiled the grate, flip it over, charred the skin.",
    "But this -- See, a lot of times    you wanna see the chicken",
    "go into the mole, and that's   how it would cook together.",
    "Me, I want a little bit         of this crust,",
    "a little bit of this char,",
    "a little more of  this California-style to it.",
    "So we'll grill the chicken,",
    "get it done    and add it with the mole.",
    "So here's the last thing      I got -- the hominy.",
    "I haven't even talked           about that.",
    "Oh. It is gonna be this       hominy slaw salsa.",
    "Beans are gonna go in there.  Pomegranate's going in there.",
    "So what I've gotta do --  Look. We're just about done.",
    "Check that out.",
    "I'll drain this,    drain and wash my beans.",
    "You come back. We'll keep putting it together.",
    "And I gotta keep an eye          on the mole.",
    "So I'll see you in a little bit.               Mm.",
    "♪♪",
    "Huh? Look at that.",
    "Steaming hot hominy.",
    "Don't hear that every day.",
    "Oh, that's fantastic.",
    "We're doing this whole         Valentine's Day",
    "cookin' with chocolate.",
    "But I say mole,",
    "and I think hominy.        I don't know why.",
    "But talking of mole,          look at this.",
    "A beautiful, deep, dark,    rich mole that's gonna go",
    "with this grilled chicken     that I have over here.",
    "Really nice, um, Mexican theme        going to it. Oh.",
    "We've got everything from slivered almonds, brown sugar,",
    "raisins, spices, guajillo, ancho chiles in there, onions,",
    "garlic, a little chicken stock.",
    "Speaking of chicken stock,          I need to get",
    "a little bit more in there.",
    "Just getting a touch too thick.",
    "And I'm trying to keep         that heat down.",
    "And what's the star        of a great mole?",
    "Exactly.       A little chocolate.",
    "Now this is   the Mexican-style chocolate",
    "you'll find in the markets.",
    "What I'm gonna do is...",
    "I'm gonna try to break it here       if I don't break --",
    "There we go.",
    "That and...there we go.",
    "Give it a little grate.     But I'll ya something.",
    "As much time as this is    gonna spend here working,",
    "I'm just gonna    throw the whole thing in.",
    "But I'll do this just so I kinda    follow some of the rules.",
    "Hey. Look over there.              Okay.",
    "You were gonna do it         anyways, right?",
    "So that chocolate's not just       regular chocolate.",
    "It's not overly sweet.",
    "But it's got a little bit of a,",
    "like,  a little cinnamon undertone,",
    "little nutmeg to it.",
    "So we'll let this just sit here         and cook down.",
    "And again, with time, this just    becomes really luxurious.",
    "Remember, we got a little bit           of manteca,",
    "we got a little pork fat            in there.",
    "Fantastic.              Okay.",
    "Hominy's done.        Beans are rinsed.",
    "Let's get into some chicken.",
    "Now this chicken    has a nice dry rub on it.",
    "And it's a free-range bird.",
    "Big, beautiful breast          right there.",
    "Skin on, bone in,      all kinds of flavor.",
    "And we got the wings as well.",
    "So we'll throw this right          into the oven",
    "right around 350 degrees.",
    "Okay?",
    "Tuck it right around the corner.",
    "Voilà.",
    "Okay. Hominy.",
    "Okay.   Let's get into the hominy.",
    "Let me get rid       of this chocolate.",
    "Let's --     I did a little zesting.",
    "And this is always   such a boring part of this,",
    "but it's so critical,",
    "because if you wanna really get   that awesome citrus flavor,",
    "you're gonna   have to do a little zesting",
    "without getting all that acid.",
    "So first we'll go in with lime        and orange zest.",
    "And this is gonna     be this dressing for --",
    "What should I call it?      I called it a slaw --",
    "slaw salsa?",
    "Something along those lines.",
    "That's exactly what it is.",
    "It's part slaw, part salsa because we're using the hominy,",
    "but we're also using the beans.",
    "So these are all gonna come            together.",
    "And I'll show you the key  ingredient here in a second,",
    "which you're gonna love this.",
    "'Cause you're thinking        Valentine's Day.",
    "Of course    you're thinking tequila.",
    "Little bit of juice.",
    "Lime juice in here.",
    "Okay.       So the juice is in.",
    "How about a little        red chile flake?",
    "Touch of some cumin.",
    "Now we got acid in here.",
    "We got a little bit of spice.",
    "What do we need next?   going with a little agave.",
    "So a little sweetness          of the agave.",
    "You know what?        Valentine's Day.",
    "Eh -- tequila.        We need tequila.",
    "I think that says -- that's --",
    "Nothing says \"I love you\"     like a little tequila.",
    "There's something      about the combination",
    "of tequila, lime and agave.",
    "A little sweetness,        a little tequila",
    "and a little lime...",
    "Uh, I think they call        that a margarita.",
    "So when you're almost making      a margarita dressing,",
    "it just kinda   triggers a natural memory.",
    "So -- and it works great.     And it's not overdone.",
    "But it's that little bite of   that tequila, a little bit",
    "of that fresh lime juice and a little bit of that agave",
    "that works so well together           in a drink,",
    "work perfect in a dressing.",
    "Oh. I'm gonna tell ya something --",
    "The zest does everything.",
    "One last key,     super-key ingredient --",
    "It's the pomegranate.       I went to Croatia.",
    "I saw pomegranate trees       growing everywhere.",
    "And I will tell ya something --",
    "I've always been a fan        of pomegranates.",
    "I didn't know exactly what they",
    "looked like on the tree,     but they were awesome.",
    "So here's my little technique to get these pomegranates out.",
    "Just take 'em.I think everybody uses this one.",
    "Hit it with the wooden spoon.",
    "Knock 'em out.           That's it.",
    "So I'm gonna add the beans,         uh, the hominy.",
    "You got the pomegranates.          Mole's done.",
    "Gotta fix the chicken 'cause       it's gonna burn up.",
    "And you come back, and I'm gonna       put it all together",
    "on a nice platter.",
    "It's gonna look fantastic.        See ya in a bit.",
    "♪♪",
    "Welcome back.           All right.",
    "So I'm just puttin'       this all together.",
    "Still thinkin'     about that theme song.",
    "I'm thinking maybe        some soft piano.",
    "Not s-- No, I agree.       Not so much. Okay.",
    "So some cilantro        and some onions,",
    "some scallions ready to go.",
    "Chicken is just finishing up          in the oven.",
    "Let's grab this.       I had to cover it.",
    "You know, sometimes     with a wood-fired oven,",
    "things get a little crazy            in here.",
    "And, uh, well worth it  because take a look at that.",
    "Gorgeous.            Gorgeous.",
    "Gorgeous.",
    "There we go.",
    "Bring it over.",
    "Now the mole sauce -- Oh!",
    "This is -- I mean, this is really coming together.",
    "Nothing says \"I love you\"           like mole.",
    "Well, I don't know.     You put that in a box,",
    "someone would be really, really scared what you're giving them.",
    "But here's what we've got.",
    "It's really cooked down         nice and silky.",
    "We've got chocolate in there.",
    "We've got, uh,some ancho chile, some chipotle,",
    "a little guajillo pepper,        almonds, raisins.",
    "Oh, the raisins --        I'm telling you,",
    "that's one of my favorite parts            about it.",
    "Okay.",
    "Now let's drop this chicken         right on here.",
    "Look at that.",
    "Nestle it right in there.",
    "Beautiful, isn't it?",
    "And the chicken     has a dry rub on it --",
    "salt and pepper, of course,",
    "little cumin,     little chipotle powder.",
    "Right inside.       What do you think?",
    "And I'm just gonna give  these all just a little kiss",
    "of some sauce.",
    "Oh. This is gorgeous.",
    "This is -- Well, they say     you're supposed to give",
    "chocolate for Valentine's Day.",
    "I'm doing it.       I'm just giving it",
    "a different form   than you'd usually expect.",
    "Okay.    This guy on top of that.",
    "Look at that.      Isn't that beautiful?",
    "And you know what?  This is kind of a quick mole.",
    "I'll be honest with you.   This one'll go pretty fast.",
    "You can get this done in 45 minutes or so.",
    "But not to saythat it lacks in flavor one bit.",
    "All right. There we are.",
    "Let me get this outta my way.",
    "And let's get to this slaw,        this slaw salsa.",
    "Now drain the beans,          black beans.",
    "Check this out.",
    "Got a little pomegranate in there, a little orange zest,",
    "a little lime zest,",
    "tequila, agave,     a little bit of cumin.",
    "The beans go in.",
    "The hominy --     Started this from dry.",
    "Boiled it a little bit.       Little bit of salt.",
    "It's tender,      but it's got texture.",
    "Drop that in.",
    "Grab a little more        of the cilantro.",
    "Just kinda give it a little   rough tear right into that.",
    "Mm.     And this vinaigrette --",
    "I mean, come on.       Look at the beans.",
    "Look at the beautiful           pomegranate",
    "just poppin' through.",
    "Touch of some salt.",
    "And you know what the great      thing about this is?",
    "Is this is gonna eat          like a salsa.",
    "It goes right alongside.",
    "But then it's nice and rich    with the beans in there,",
    "so it'll be kind of a salad       alongside of that.",
    "Oh.",
    "Gotta get a bite of this.",
    "Tender beans, little snap,",
    "just a little pop of        that pomegranate,",
    "the big chew coming through from  that hominy, the vinaigrette,",
    "the tequila shining  right through, little agave,",
    "little kiss of the sweetness.",
    "I gotta serve this        all up for my mom",
    "and for Lori, get this ready.",
    "But I'm just going to --           All right.",
    "For responsibility's sake,         I need to just,",
    "you know, kinda break into this.",
    "I mean, I'm not having --  I'm not eating ahead of time.",
    "I just wanna make sure that Loriand my mom are getting the best.",
    "Don't tell anybody.",
    "Oh! That's exactly      what I wanted to do!",
    "Grill the chicken,",
    "give it its own texture,        its own identity,",
    "and then add that awesome mole.",
    "So many times    you'll find that chicken",
    "cooked in the sauce.",
    "It's great.       Don't get me wrong.",
    "But this has another layer.      This has some crunch.",
    "This is -- Oh!   This is what you wanna do.",
    "Foodnetwork.com/guys-big-bite.",
    "Get the recipe. Download this.",
    "This'll be awesome for --          I don't know.",
    "You take the holiday,       especially Thanks--",
    "especially Thanksgiving      and Valentine's Day.",
    "This is your bird.",
    "I'll see you next week         on \"Big Bite.\"",
    "Welcome to \"Big Bite.\"",
    "You know, during the holidays,",
    "you can expect three things to happen here at the Fieri house.",
    "One -- we will have no snow   'cause we're in California.",
    "Two -- there will be        a lot of laughs.",
    "There's a lot of laughs when my family comes together.",
    "And three -- without question,   we will eat Dungeness crab,",
    "I mean, in any way,  shape, or form we can get it.",
    "So that's what we're gonna do is an old classic with a new spin,",
    "starting off with  my grilled seafood cioppino.",
    "Packed with beautiful  Dungeness crab, sea scallops,",
    "halibut, and jumbo shrimp,    all served with a smokey,",
    "fire-roasted tomato      and vegetable puree,",
    "and grilled polenta   with peppers and Pecorino.",
    "It's got flavor.        It's got texture.",
    "And it's the perfect thing to round out this holiday meal.",
    "So, lemon juice, tons of it,",
    "because, believe it or not, I'm gonna marinate the seafood,",
    "which I'll get into        in just a second,",
    "but I had to get this      out of the way 'cause",
    "nothing more exciting     than just sitting here",
    "and squeezing all this    lemon juice by yourself.",
    "Let's talk about the polenta        and the peppers.",
    "Hang tight.",
    "Couple red and a couple Anaheim,",
    "and this is gonna be great flavor, as well as great color.",
    "And I'll tell you one thing      we love around here,",
    "it's polenta.",
    "I mean, it's --    I don't know what it is.",
    "It's something about being warm.",
    "It's something       about being thick.",
    "It's something  about the fact I love grits.",
    "I don't know,      but polenta plays in.",
    "A little bit of olive oil,",
    "a little salt and pepper to that, and a super hot grill.",
    "Okay.",
    "And all I'm gonna do here       is roast these off",
    "and then take 'em, throw 'em  back in this bowl, sweat 'em,",
    "and then later,       I'll take the seeds",
    "and the skins and the stems off.",
    "Okay?Ready for the start of the show?",
    "Hang tight.",
    "Seafood.",
    "This is the bounty         of the county.",
    "Oh.",
    "Huh?          Look at that.",
    "Now I said that, you know,    the crab, the Dungeness,",
    "that's the big player here,",
    "but I had to go grab everything  they had down at the market.",
    "So, first, the Dungeness crab.",
    "Now they have been cleaned,  but I like to keep the shell",
    "just because it   makes a nice presentation.",
    "So you've these beautiful         Dungeness crab.",
    "And this is really the king  of the crab, in our opinion,",
    "here in Northern California.",
    "We're talking about buttery,           sweet meat.",
    "You're getting      a really good yield.",
    "You get a ton of crab          out of this.",
    "All that body meat is fantastic,  and, putting it on the grill,",
    "I know it sounds crazy,    but you're gonna love it.",
    "Then we have some big          jumbo prawns.",
    "These are like four to a pound.",
    "And anytime you  can grill it with a shell on,",
    "we know that's great flavor,",
    "but then to grill it        with the head on?",
    "Not only is the presentation            awesome,",
    "but the flavor goes crazy.",
    "And then some halibut.",
    "You can use whatever type        of fish you want,",
    "but I'm looking for a nice,        firm white fish.",
    "Typically, a cioppino     is cooked in the sauce,",
    "all the seafood goes into  the sauce at different times.",
    "But we're gonna grill this.   Just grill it to perfection",
    "and then add it     to this grilled sauce.",
    "Outrageous.  And then scallops, of course.",
    "I mean, look at these beautiful,       big, fat scallops,",
    "and we're gonna do it on a hot grill, just gonna sear",
    "'em a little bit.           Fantastic.",
    "But let's talk      about this marinade.",
    "A monster bowl...",
    "a bounty of lemon juice...",
    "some salt.",
    "Don't have to go too heavy          on the salt.",
    "Granted, it all      came out of the sea.",
    "Black pepper.",
    "Just get in      with a little garlic.",
    "And I'm just gonna rough chop          that garlic.",
    "This will break down.",
    "It'll share its flavor.",
    "A little white wine.",
    "And another one of my favorites    when it comes to seafood",
    "is some capers.",
    "They couldn't make      the jar any smaller.",
    "And they start falling       all over the place.",
    "Okay.",
    "Just like I do with the garlic,   just give 'em a little pop,",
    "just to kind      of open it up a bit.",
    "And, last but not least,     you think of the spice.",
    "Man, I been to      some cioppino feeds.",
    "Whoo!    I mean, it is all spice.",
    "so we'll just add a little bit     of chili flake to this.",
    "And then, to coat it all,",
    "to help all this great flavor     stick to this seafood,",
    "a little bit of olive oil, okay?",
    "Let me give this a quick whisk.",
    "Now I'll turn this a few times      as I let it marinate.",
    "But what we're gonna          do right now,",
    "we'll drop that nice, big piece of halibut in there.",
    "That's what we're talkin' about.",
    "Then we'll get       those scallops in.",
    "Beautiful.",
    "We'll throw in -- I'm gonna pop that crab in half",
    "just like that.",
    "Excellent.",
    "The other one -- Look at this,      and this is so fresh.",
    "There we go, down the side.",
    "And then we'll throw prawns  that will take it real quick.",
    "So grab this and a little foil,       and we'll go back.",
    "'Cause what do you want? Youwant your seafood nice and cold.",
    "We'll throw a little cover         on top of that.",
    "Now I got to wash my hands.              Okay?",
    "All right.",
    "All right.",
    "Now keepin' that cold 'cause   you want that seafood cold,",
    "just like when you get it         at the market.",
    "All right.Now let's get into some polenta.",
    "So I've got some boiling water.",
    "Oh, I forgot a leg.",
    "Ah.",
    "One down.",
    "Okay.",
    "Let me give these a little turn           real quick.",
    "That's right. That's what we're looking for,",
    "nice char on 'em.",
    "We wanna talk about charring 'em   but not burning the flesh.",
    "I don't wanna burn all the way       through the pepper,",
    "so this is exactly      where we want to go.",
    "And if you don't have an outdoor grill, don't worry about that.",
    "Doing them in the oven,      super easy way to go.",
    "4½ cups of boiling water.",
    "I've got wet hands.",
    "I'm gonna do the salt          with a spoon,",
    "and a little bit of salt,",
    "and let's get into some polenta.",
    "Now, polenta, grits,     call it what you want.",
    "All I know    is we're talking creamy.",
    "We're talking great texture.",
    "We're talking an Italian staple.",
    "We're talking a Southern staple,",
    "my mom   coming from North Carolina.",
    "So this is perfect   to play into the holidays.",
    "About 1 1/2 cups,      a little bit of salt.",
    "Just slowly whisk these in,  not wanting them to clump up.",
    "There we go.",
    "Huh?",
    "Wait till you see what I do        with these grits.",
    "Oh-ho.",
    "This is all about holidays,     'cause holidays for us,",
    "you know,   the kids are out of school,",
    "lots of family coming over,        a lot of friends.",
    "Of course,     what they're expecting",
    "is to walk    into a nice presentation.",
    "Well, I'm gonna  give 'em that and then some.",
    "Okay.",
    "There you go.",
    "Polenta's working.",
    "I'll grab the peppers,   wrap 'em with some plastic,",
    "sweat 'em, gonna peel 'em in a little bit.",
    "The seafood's hanging out.           Come back.",
    "we're doing a holiday cioppino    that no one will forget.",
    "See ya in a little bit.",
    "Welcome back to \"Big Bite.\"",
    "You don't even have to ask    what time of year it is.",
    "You can tell  from beautiful Dungeness crab",
    "at the Fieri house that it   must be around the holidays",
    "because, man,   if we're eating one thing,",
    "we're eating Dungeness.",
    "So look at this beautiful  marinating setup I have here.",
    "I mean, I've got everything from jumbo prawns to Dungeness crab",
    "to an enormous piece of halibut",
    "all sitting down   in this delicious marinade",
    "of garlic and chili flakeand capers, a lot of white wine,",
    "a little olive oil,",
    "and a lot of lemon juice,      a lot of lemon juice.",
    "But look at these --   look at this size scallop.",
    "Now, I'm making cioppino.   Now, we all love cioppino.",
    "We all have     our favorite cioppino.",
    "And if you don't know        what cioppino is,",
    "we're talking    about a tomato base stock",
    "that has fresh seafood in it.",
    "And they said that it was invented here in San Francisco",
    "about an hour away.",
    "And the beauty of it is     is it can kind of take",
    "on whatever seafood       you have available.",
    "The key is,treat the seafood the right way.",
    "So I've got  this sitting here marinating.",
    "And just --   Ah, it's gonna be fantastic",
    "because I'm going     to grill this cioppino.",
    "I haven't seen it done before.",
    "I've done cioppino      on \"Big Bite\" before,",
    "but not in the grilled fashion.",
    "And I was out here doin' it,     I said, \"You know what?",
    "I really wanna get everything      out of this seafood.\"",
    "So to grill it,I can really watch how it cooks,",
    "and I don't have it just     simmering in the sauce,",
    "but I still make the sauce   and add it to the seafood.",
    "You're gonna love this.All right. Let me put this away.",
    "Keeping the seafood cold.",
    "And let's get into the polenta.",
    "That's what's gonna       go alongside here.",
    "We love our polenta     around the Fieri house.",
    "So I've got     some roasted peppers --",
    "roasted red bell peppers    and some green Anaheims,",
    "so just a little bit       of heat from that.",
    "A little salt, a little    olive oil, little pepper,",
    "threw 'em on the grill,",
    "then threw 'em in a bowl, let 'em sweat, cleaned 'em up,",
    "and took the stems and the seeds   and everything out of 'em.",
    "And now I'm gonna mix 'em     into this really nice,",
    "hearty polenta, lay it out  on a tray, let it cool a bit.",
    "And then I'll pop it         into the oven.",
    "The key is, I'm just gonna     add a bunch of cheese.",
    "Okay.",
    "Lookin' good with that.",
    "Slide this over.",
    "Heavy bottom pot always helps to not burn the polenta.",
    "Ton of peppers going in.",
    "Okay.Pecorino -- let's talk about it.",
    "Super nice and salty.",
    "You can smell it.",
    "Okay.         So about 1 cup.",
    "Maybe I gave it      a little extra there.",
    "Give this a little stir.",
    "Awesome color      coming through that.",
    "I already added a little bit        of salt to that.",
    "I have to watch it     because that cheese --",
    "that cheese     itself is pretty salty.",
    "Okay.",
    "And just a little butter.",
    "It's a warm day here.",
    "That's how the holidays are",
    "in Northern California,         nice and warm.",
    "I'm standing out here in shorts.",
    "Okay, got that.",
    "Sheet tray, a little bit          of olive oil,",
    "cooking spray if you have it,    just so it doesn't stick.",
    "Okay.",
    "Ah, that's what I thought        was gonna happen.",
    "Excuse me. We got to break out       the rubber spatula.",
    "Ah, this is gonna         be so worth it.",
    "A lot of steps in this,",
    "but if you like polenta    like I do, you'll get it.",
    "Okay.",
    "And now we'll just smooth   it out, still nice and hot.",
    "Fantastic.",
    "Okay.",
    "Set that aside.",
    "Now let's talk about the sauce",
    "that's gonna go with          the cioppino.",
    "What do we need?",
    "Exactly.     A bunch of vegetables.",
    "So I'm gonna grab         the whole bowl.",
    "Almost gonna use       every bit of this,",
    "but we'll jump in here.",
    "Okay.",
    "Let's take this,      get that, here we go.",
    "Grab a tray 'cause I'm gonna put        a little marinade",
    "on these as we work.",
    "So the first thing   I'm gonna start off with --",
    "oh -- is a bunch        of Roma tomatoes.",
    "Last of the Romas.",
    "Tomato sauce and cioppino --          hand in hand.",
    "Next up, red bell pepper.",
    "Red bell pepper and a big onion.",
    "One more -- the fennel.",
    "The key here    is to keep these fronds.",
    "We'll hold those to the side.",
    "Fennel and cioppino -- you wanna      talk about something",
    "going hand in hand, that's like  Bogie and Bacall right there.",
    "I don't know  why I used Bogie and Bacall.",
    "I haven't used    that line in a long time.",
    "Okay.       So there's fennel.",
    "There's that.       Now check this out.",
    "Get a little bit of olive oil,",
    "little bit of salt,   touch of some black pepper.",
    "Believe it or not, we're gonna  hit it with a little fennel.",
    "Fennel's a strong flavor        in this cioppino.",
    "Okay.  We add a little fennel seeds.",
    "And we'll hit it with a little red chili flake.",
    "Again, spice    is a key piece, as well.",
    "And the last thing, and this  is not what you're expecting",
    "'cause you know garlic's gonna come into play,",
    "but not the way that we're gonna      do garlic like this.",
    "So we're gonna cut the top off.",
    "Shout it out     if you know the answer.",
    "Exactly.  We're gonna roast the garlic",
    "like this.",
    "Great way -- Roasting garlic --        I'm telling ya --",
    "You've got the oven hot.       You're gonna do it.",
    "You know you'll use         roasted garlic.",
    "Get a little bit of olive oil,    some salt, black pepper.",
    "We're gonna kind of just nest      this up a little bit.",
    "It'll steam as it roasts.",
    "Give it a little breathing room           like that.",
    "Over to the grill.",
    "Now I'll lay that bad boy there.",
    "Start to throw the fennel on,",
    "throw the peppers,     just keep an eye on it.",
    "And, you know, here's   the cool thing about this.",
    "This is one of those things       that you can grill.",
    "You don't have to worry     about how ugly it looks",
    "because this is all gonna         get pureed up.",
    "So if it has a little extra char        to it, fantastic.",
    "That's a little extra flavor.",
    "Look at that.",
    "See if I can kinda slide 'em on.               Ah.",
    "Tell me that doesn't look great            already.",
    "And to think this is all gonna",
    "come together       for a seafood dish.",
    "That's my idea, right there.              Okay.",
    "So here we go.      Saving those fronds.",
    "Roasting the veggies.",
    "The seafood is down.",
    "Last thing I'm gonna do      is take this polenta,",
    "bake it off in the oven.",
    "We're gonna cut that.   We're gonna grill it later.",
    "Come on back.",
    "This is how we celebratethe holidays at the Fieri house.",
    "See ya in a bit.",
    "Welcome back.      I'm making cioppino.",
    "Well, actually,        grilled cioppino.",
    "It's the holiday times",
    "here at the Fieri casa,        and look at this.",
    "I've got everything  from roasted grilled onions,",
    "Roma tomatoes, fennel.",
    "Whoo.           Hot grill.",
    "Yeah, that's what we do   in the holiday times here,",
    "is grill our vegetables.",
    "But I'm gonna make    this fantastic cioppino.",
    "I've got a bunch of seafood that's in the fridge right now",
    "just marinating   in lemon juice, white wine,",
    "garlic, capers, you name it.",
    "And this right here, well,   this is the cioppino sauce.",
    "You don't typically see it as",
    "a fire-roasted cioppino sauce,  but I'll tell ya somethin' --",
    "We're gonna highlight that  seafood incredibly with this.",
    "A little bit of chicken stock,          drop this on.",
    "Now I took the seeds",
    "and the stems     out of the bell pepper,",
    "but otherwise,      everybody's in there.",
    "Look at all that char       and all those bits.",
    "All right.",
    "That's my kind      of cioppino sauce --",
    "fire roasted, right on.",
    "There we go.    And if it gets too thick,",
    "I got a little chicken stock         to thin it out.",
    "But right now, oh, youshould taste the fennel in that.",
    "Righteous.              Okay.",
    "Let's take a look at that.       Now, inside here --",
    "inside here,      take a look at this.",
    "Roasting off this polenta,   and it's about ready to go.",
    "So I'm gonna pull it out, let it cool down a little bit,",
    "and then we'll be able to grill         that in a bit.",
    "All right, now --       Oh, you know what?",
    "I'm forgetting the key      to this whole thing.",
    "Check this out.",
    "Hiding under here...",
    "I started this garlic up on top,",
    "but it wasn't roasting enough.",
    "So down here in the coals,   I've got my roasted garlic.",
    "And we'll just -- Of course,",
    "you got to have garlic        in your cioppino.",
    "Check that out.",
    "I'll just let that chill,     cool down for a second.",
    "Let's grab the seafood.              Okay.",
    "Scallops, halibut, big prawns,",
    "and, of course, Dungeness crab all coming over.",
    "Isn't that beautiful?",
    "Look at that.",
    "So we have the capers,the lemon juice, the white wine,",
    "a little chili flake,  a bunch of garlic, of course.",
    "So let me lower this grate.",
    "Okay. A little fennel seeds    were coming off of there.",
    "Now, this is where this kind",
    "of gets into  some decision-making process.",
    "What do I want to add first?",
    "Well, I got the hard shell          of the crab.",
    "and it's pretty industrial.",
    "I mean, it can --  it can handle the heavy heat.",
    "So I'm gonna      throw that on first.",
    "Now I've got some really tender            scallops.",
    "I don't wanna put those on           right now.",
    "That crab's gonna   take a little bit of time.",
    "The shrimp, they're protected     also with their shell,",
    "these prawns, so I'm gonna  go ahead and throw those on.",
    "The scallops      are gonna be the ones",
    "that I'm really gonna wait    just till the last minute",
    "'cause all I want to do  is just char it a little bit.",
    "That sauce is gonna be warm,",
    "so when the scallops          go in there,",
    "they'll just   finish cooking right there.",
    "Look at that. You should smell it right now.",
    "I mean, it smells like a --almost kind of like a crab boil,",
    "or like when you're cooking             some --",
    "some oysters on the grill.",
    "Look at that.",
    "Okay.",
    "And here we go.   I'm gonna put the fish on.",
    "It'll probably go on last       and come off first.",
    "Nestle that right       in on top of there.",
    "And then I'm just gonna holdthose scallops for a little bit.",
    "I'll put those     on at the last minute.",
    "Okay.",
    "Slide that to the side.",
    "Oh.",
    "The flavors, I'm telling you.",
    "Now, I took that garlic,            roasted,",
    "a little bit of salt and pepper.",
    "And this, well, this  can get a little bit sticky.",
    "Trust me,   I've done this enough times",
    "from the days in the restaurant.",
    "All right.",
    "Awesome.     Roasted garlic's down.",
    "Seafood's on the grill.",
    "We are doing grilled cioppino.  People are flying in for it.",
    "It's gonna be a blast!        See ya in a bit.",
    "Welcome back. Man, it is hot       in here right now.",
    "You wouldn't think,        in the holidays,",
    "it's gonna be this warm.",
    "But what we've got goin'      is grilled cioppino.",
    "I'm keeping an eye    on my scallops right now.",
    "So I'm just trying to finish up this fantastic cioppino sauce.",
    "Grilled tomatoes       and red bell pepper",
    "and a little bit of fennel.      Some roasted garlic.",
    "I'll get that later 'cause",
    "I don't want    the scallops to overcook.",
    "Add a little ouzo there because, if you've got a good cioppino,",
    "you know it's got some spice,      it's got some garlic,",
    "and it's got a nice      little anise flavor,",
    "and...Ah.",
    "That is right on.              Okay.",
    "We'll take this.",
    "Gonna pour it right      onto my platter here.",
    "And I've got some grilled     polenta sitting there.",
    "Add a little roasted peppers  to it, add a little Pecorino",
    "cheese to it, let it cool,",
    "put it on a sheet tray, popped it in the oven, put a little --",
    "browned it a little bit,",
    "then took it, cut it in some --",
    "in some squares and grilled it.",
    "Now some beautiful halibut",
    "that's all marinated,           by the way.",
    "leave that right there.",
    "All marinated in some capers,      a little chili flake,",
    "some garlic, some white white,",
    "a bunch of lemon juice,        salt and pepper.",
    "Take these beautiful scallops,   lay those around the side.",
    "And I just want these super,          super tender",
    "'cause they're gonna   sit inside that hot sauce.",
    "I mean, look at that.",
    "Tell me that is not gorgeous.",
    "Right like that.        Oh, don't worry.",
    "Nothing will happen to that    except for me eating it,",
    "but, you know,   I don't tell anybody that.",
    "Look at that.",
    "Get a little bit of the sauce.",
    "Just drop a little bit         on top of this.",
    "I mean, it's gorgeous.",
    "Little more of the basil,",
    "some of the fennel fronds that  I had, lay that over on top.",
    "So you grab a nice piece    of that grilled polenta.",
    "It's a busy day      at the airport here.",
    "Some fresh lemon juice   right over the top of that.",
    "Huh?",
    "Tell me that is not a platter      set for the holidays.",
    "Is that beautiful or what?",
    "I'm telling you,     that is just gorgeous,",
    "especially   with that grilled polenta.",
    "That's what makes it, that  and a nice little white wine.",
    "Okay. First, I got to dig into          some polenta,",
    "a little bit of this halibut.",
    "Mm. And then, when you wanna get your crab --",
    "I'm a body meat guy.",
    "So you dip it right in there,      this Dungeness crab.",
    "Of all the crab that I have,",
    "I mean, from --  from king crab, snow crab --",
    "You can tell I don't like it.",
    "This is the one to go to.",
    "Now, listen, you might not   be able to find Dungeness.",
    "Don't worry.  You find your favorite crab.",
    "But here's the idea.",
    "I don't care if it's snowing.",
    "Get out on that porch,     fire up that barbecue,",
    "grill off the seafood,",
    "keep it in the shell,     put a nice char to it.",
    "We all love that char flavor.",
    "It takes us back to summer.",
    "So have summer      during the holidays.",
    "You wanna get this recipe?      You know what to do.",
    "foodnetwork.com/guysbigbite.",
    "And then grilled cioppino recipe       is waiting for you.",
    "Have a great holiday.      Take care, you guys.",
    "See ya later.",
    "♪♪",
    "Welcome to \"Big Bite.\"",
    "You know, during the holidays,",
    "you can expect three things to happen here at the Fieri house.",
    "One -- we will have no snow   'cause we're in California.",
    "Two -- there will be        a lot of laughs.",
    "There's a lot of laughs when my family comes together.",
    "And three -- without question,   we will eat Dungeness crab,",
    "I mean, in any way,  shape, or form we can get it.",
    "So that's what we're gonna do is an old classic with a new spin,",
    "starting off with  my grilled seafood cioppino.",
    "Packed with beautiful  Dungeness crab, sea scallops,",
    "halibut, and jumbo shrimp,    all served with a smokey,",
    "fire-roasted tomato      and vegetable puree,",
    "and grilled polenta   with peppers and Pecorino.",
    "It's got flavor.        It's got texture.",
    "And it's the perfect thing to round out this holiday meal.",
    "So, lemon juice, tons of it,",
    "because, believe it or not, I'm gonna marinate the seafood,",
    "which I'll get into        in just a second,",
    "but I had to get this      out of the way 'cause",
    "nothing more exciting     than just sitting here",
    "and squeezing all this    lemon juice by yourself.",
    "Let's talk about the polenta        and the peppers.",
    "Hang tight.",
    "Couple red and a couple Anaheim,",
    "and this is gonna be great flavor, as well as great color.",
    "And I'll tell you one thing      we love around here,",
    "it's polenta.",
    "I mean, it's --    I don't know what it is.",
    "It's something about being warm.",
    "It's something       about being thick.",
    "It's something  about the fact I love grits.",
    "I don't know,      but polenta plays in.",
    "A little bit of olive oil,",
    "a little salt and pepper to that, and a super hot grill.",
    "Okay.",
    "And all I'm gonna do here       is roast these off",
    "and then take 'em, throw 'em  back in this bowl, sweat 'em,",
    "and then later,       I'll take the seeds",
    "and the skins and the stems off.",
    "Okay?Ready for the start of the show?",
    "Hang tight.",
    "Seafood.",
    "This is the bounty         of the county.",
    "Oh.",
    "Huh?          Look at that.",
    "Now I said that, you know,    the crab, the Dungeness,",
    "that's the big player here,",
    "but I had to go grab everything  they had down at the market.",
    "So, first, the Dungeness crab.",
    "Now they have been cleaned,  but I like to keep the shell",
    "just because it   makes a nice presentation.",
    "So you've these beautiful         Dungeness crab.",
    "And this is really the king  of the crab, in our opinion,",
    "here in Northern California.",
    "We're talking about buttery,           sweet meat.",
    "You're getting      a really good yield.",
    "You get a ton of crab          out of this.",
    "All that body meat is fantastic,  and, putting it on the grill,",
    "I know it sounds crazy,    but you're gonna love it.",
    "Then we have some big          jumbo prawns.",
    "These are like four to a pound.",
    "And anytime you  can grill it with a shell on,",
    "we know that's great flavor,",
    "but then to grill it        with the head on?",
    "Not only is the presentation            awesome,",
    "but the flavor goes crazy.",
    "And then some halibut.",
    "You can use whatever type        of fish you want,",
    "but I'm looking for a nice,        firm white fish.",
    "Typically, a cioppino     is cooked in the sauce,",
    "all the seafood goes into  the sauce at different times.",
    "But we're gonna grill this.   Just grill it to perfection",
    "and then add it     to this grilled sauce.",
    "Outrageous.  And then scallops, of course.",
    "I mean, look at these beautiful,       big, fat scallops,",
    "and we're gonna do it on a hot grill, just gonna sear",
    "'em a little bit.           Fantastic.",
    "But let's talk      about this marinade.",
    "A monster bowl...",
    "a bounty of lemon juice...",
    "some salt.",
    "Don't have to go too heavy          on the salt.",
    "Granted, it all      came out of the sea.",
    "Black pepper.",
    "Just get in      with a little garlic.",
    "And I'm just gonna rough chop          that garlic.",
    "This will break down.",
    "It'll share its flavor.",
    "A little white wine.",
    "And another one of my favorites    when it comes to seafood",
    "is some capers.",
    "They couldn't make      the jar any smaller.",
    "And they start falling       all over the place.",
    "Okay.",
    "Just like I do with the garlic,   just give 'em a little pop,",
    "just to kind      of open it up a bit.",
    "And, last but not least,     you think of the spice.",
    "Man, I been to      some cioppino feeds.",
    "Whoo!    I mean, it is all spice.",
    "so we'll just add a little bit     of chili flake to this.",
    "And then, to coat it all,",
    "to help all this great flavor     stick to this seafood,",
    "a little bit of olive oil, okay?",
    "Let me give this a quick whisk.",
    "Now I'll turn this a few times      as I let it marinate.",
    "But what we're gonna          do right now,",
    "we'll drop that nice, big piece of halibut in there.",
    "That's what we're talkin' about.",
    "Then we'll get       those scallops in.",
    "Beautiful.",
    "We'll throw in -- I'm gonna pop that crab in half",
    "just like that.",
    "Excellent.",
    "The other one -- Look at this,      and this is so fresh.",
    "There we go, down the side.",
    "And then we'll throw prawns  that will take it real quick.",
    "So grab this and a little foil,       and we'll go back.",
    "'Cause what do you want? Youwant your seafood nice and cold.",
    "We'll throw a little cover         on top of that.",
    "Now I got to wash my hands.              Okay?",
    "All right.",
    "All right.",
    "Now keepin' that cold 'cause   you want that seafood cold,",
    "just like when you get it         at the market.",
    "All right.Now let's get into some polenta.",
    "So I've got some boiling water.",
    "Oh, I forgot a leg.",
    "Ah.",
    "One down.",
    "Okay.",
    "Let me give these a little turn           real quick.",
    "That's right. That's what we're looking for,",
    "nice char on 'em.",
    "We wanna talk about charring 'em   but not burning the flesh.",
    "I don't wanna burn all the way       through the pepper,",
    "so this is exactly      where we want to go.",
    "And if you don't have an outdoor grill, don't worry about that.",
    "Doing them in the oven,      super easy way to go.",
    "4½ cups of boiling water.",
    "I've got wet hands.",
    "I'm gonna do the salt          with a spoon,",
    "and a little bit of salt,",
    "and let's get into some polenta.",
    "Now, polenta, grits,     call it what you want.",
    "All I know    is we're talking creamy.",
    "We're talking great texture.",
    "We're talking an Italian staple.",
    "We're talking a Southern staple,",
    "my mom   coming from North Carolina.",
    "So this is perfect   to play into the holidays.",
    "About 1 1/2 cups,      a little bit of salt.",
    "Just slowly whisk these in,  not wanting them to clump up.",
    "There we go.",
    "Huh?",
    "Wait till you see what I do        with these grits.",
    "Oh-ho.",
    "This is all about holidays,     'cause holidays for us,",
    "you know,   the kids are out of school,",
    "lots of family coming over,        a lot of friends.",
    "Of course,     what they're expecting",
    "is to walk    into a nice presentation.",
    "Well, I'm gonna  give 'em that and then some.",
    "Okay.",
    "There you go.",
    "Polenta's working.",
    "I'll grab the peppers,   wrap 'em with some plastic,",
    "sweat 'em, gonna peel 'em in a little bit.",
    "The seafood's hanging out.           Come back.",
    "we're doing a holiday cioppino    that no one will forget.",
    "See ya in a little bit.",
    "Welcome back to \"Big Bite.\"",
    "You don't even have to ask    what time of year it is.",
    "You can tell  from beautiful Dungeness crab",
    "at the Fieri house that it   must be around the holidays",
    "because, man,   if we're eating one thing,",
    "we're eating Dungeness.",
    "So look at this beautiful  marinating setup I have here.",
    "I mean, I've got everything from jumbo prawns to Dungeness crab",
    "to an enormous piece of halibut",
    "all sitting down   in this delicious marinade",
    "of garlic and chili flakeand capers, a lot of white wine,",
    "a little olive oil,",
    "and a lot of lemon juice,      a lot of lemon juice.",
    "But look at these --   look at this size scallop.",
    "Now, I'm making cioppino.   Now, we all love cioppino.",
    "We all have     our favorite cioppino.",
    "And if you don't know        what cioppino is,",
    "we're talking    about a tomato base stock",
    "that has fresh seafood in it.",
    "And they said that it was invented here in San Francisco",
    "about an hour away.",
    "And the beauty of it is     is it can kind of take",
    "on whatever seafood       you have available.",
    "The key is,treat the seafood the right way.",
    "So I've got  this sitting here marinating.",
    "And just --   Ah, it's gonna be fantastic",
    "because I'm going     to grill this cioppino.",
    "I haven't seen it done before.",
    "I've done cioppino      on \"Big Bite\" before,",
    "but not in the grilled fashion.",
    "And I was out here doin' it,     I said, \"You know what?",
    "I really wanna get everything      out of this seafood.\"",
    "So to grill it,I can really watch how it cooks,",
    "and I don't have it just     simmering in the sauce,",
    "but I still make the sauce   and add it to the seafood.",
    "You're gonna love this.All right. Let me put this away.",
    "Keeping the seafood cold.",
    "And let's get into the polenta.",
    "That's what's gonna       go alongside here.",
    "We love our polenta     around the Fieri house.",
    "So I've got     some roasted peppers --",
    "roasted red bell peppers    and some green Anaheims,",
    "so just a little bit       of heat from that.",
    "A little salt, a little    olive oil, little pepper,",
    "threw 'em on the grill,",
    "then threw 'em in a bowl, let 'em sweat, cleaned 'em up,",
    "and took the stems and the seeds   and everything out of 'em.",
    "And now I'm gonna mix 'em     into this really nice,",
    "hearty polenta, lay it out  on a tray, let it cool a bit.",
    "And then I'll pop it         into the oven.",
    "The key is, I'm just gonna     add a bunch of cheese.",
    "Okay.",
    "Lookin' good with that.",
    "Slide this over.",
    "Heavy bottom pot always helps to not burn the polenta.",
    "Ton of peppers going in.",
    "Okay.Pecorino -- let's talk about it.",
    "Super nice and salty.",
    "You can smell it.",
    "Okay.         So about 1 cup.",
    "Maybe I gave it      a little extra there.",
    "Give this a little stir.",
    "Awesome color      coming through that.",
    "I already added a little bit        of salt to that.",
    "I have to watch it     because that cheese --",
    "that cheese     itself is pretty salty.",
    "Okay.",
    "And just a little butter.",
    "It's a warm day here.",
    "That's how the holidays are",
    "in Northern California,         nice and warm.",
    "I'm standing out here in shorts.",
    "Okay, got that.",
    "Sheet tray, a little bit          of olive oil,",
    "cooking spray if you have it,    just so it doesn't stick.",
    "Okay.",
    "Ah, that's what I thought        was gonna happen.",
    "Excuse me. We got to break out       the rubber spatula.",
    "Ah, this is gonna         be so worth it.",
    "A lot of steps in this,",
    "but if you like polenta    like I do, you'll get it.",
    "Okay.",
    "And now we'll just smooth   it out, still nice and hot.",
    "Fantastic.",
    "Okay.",
    "Set that aside.",
    "Now let's talk about the sauce",
    "that's gonna go with          the cioppino.",
    "What do we need?",
    "Exactly.     A bunch of vegetables.",
    "So I'm gonna grab         the whole bowl.",
    "Almost gonna use       every bit of this,",
    "but we'll jump in here.",
    "Okay.",
    "Let's take this,      get that, here we go.",
    "Grab a tray 'cause I'm gonna put        a little marinade",
    "on these as we work.",
    "So the first thing   I'm gonna start off with --",
    "oh -- is a bunch        of Roma tomatoes.",
    "♪♪",
    "Last of the Romas.",
    "Tomato sauce and cioppino --          hand in hand.",
    "Next up, red bell pepper.",
    "Red bell pepper and a big onion.",
    "One more -- the fennel.",
    "The key here    is to keep these fronds.",
    "We'll hold those to the side.",
    "Fennel and cioppino -- you wanna      talk about something",
    "going hand in hand, that's like  Bogie and Bacall right there.",
    "I don't know  why I used Bogie and Bacall.",
    "I haven't used    that line in a long time.",
    "Okay.       So there's fennel.",
    "There's that.       Now check this out.",
    "Get a little bit of olive oil,",
    "little bit of salt,   touch of some black pepper.",
    "Believe it or not, we're gonna  hit it with a little fennel.",
    "Fennel's a strong flavor        in this cioppino.",
    "Okay.  We add a little fennel seeds.",
    "And we'll hit it with a little red chili flake.",
    "Again, spice    is a key piece, as well.",
    "And the last thing, and this  is not what you're expecting",
    "'cause you know garlic's gonna come into play,",
    "but not the way that we're gonna      do garlic like this.",
    "So we're gonna cut the top off.",
    "Shout it out     if you know the answer.",
    "Exactly.  We're gonna roast the garlic",
    "like this.",
    "Great way -- Roasting garlic --        I'm telling ya --",
    "You've got the oven hot.       You're gonna do it.",
    "You know you'll use         roasted garlic.",
    "Get a little bit of olive oil,    some salt, black pepper.",
    "We're gonna kind of just nest      this up a little bit.",
    "It'll steam as it roasts.",
    "Give it a little breathing room           like that.",
    "Over to the grill.",
    "Now I'll lay that bad boy there.",
    "Start to throw the fennel on,",
    "throw the peppers,     just keep an eye on it.",
    "And, you know, here's   the cool thing about this.",
    "This is one of those things       that you can grill.",
    "You don't have to worry     about how ugly it looks",
    "because this is all gonna         get pureed up.",
    "So if it has a little extra char        to it, fantastic.",
    "That's a little extra flavor.",
    "Look at that.",
    "See if I can kinda slide 'em on.               Ah.",
    "Tell me that doesn't look great            already.",
    "And to think this is all gonna",
    "come together       for a seafood dish.",
    "That's my idea, right there.              Okay.",
    "So here we go.      Saving those fronds.",
    "Roasting the veggies.",
    "The seafood is down.",
    "Last thing I'm gonna do      is take this polenta,",
    "bake it off in the oven.",
    "We're gonna cut that.   We're gonna grill it later.",
    "Come on back.",
    "This is how we celebratethe holidays at the Fieri house.",
    "See ya in a bit.",
    "Welcome back.      I'm making cioppino.",
    "Well, actually,        grilled cioppino.",
    "It's the holiday times",
    "here at the Fieri casa,        and look at this.",
    "I've got everything  from roasted grilled onions,",
    "Roma tomatoes, fennel.",
    "Whoo.           Hot grill.",
    "Yeah, that's what we do   in the holiday times here,",
    "is grill our vegetables.",
    "But I'm gonna make    this fantastic cioppino.",
    "I've got a bunch of seafood that's in the fridge right now",
    "just marinating   in lemon juice, white wine,",
    "garlic, capers, you name it.",
    "And this right here, well,   this is the cioppino sauce.",
    "You don't typically see it as",
    "a fire-roasted cioppino sauce,  but I'll tell ya somethin' --",
    "We're gonna highlight that  seafood incredibly with this.",
    "A little bit of chicken stock,          drop this on.",
    "Now I took the seeds",
    "and the stems     out of the bell pepper,",
    "but otherwise,      everybody's in there.",
    "Look at all that char       and all those bits.",
    "All right.",
    "That's my kind      of cioppino sauce --",
    "fire roasted, right on.",
    "There we go.    And if it gets too thick,",
    "I got a little chicken stock         to thin it out.",
    "But right now, oh, youshould taste the fennel in that.",
    "Righteous.              Okay.",
    "Let's take a look at that.       Now, inside here --",
    "inside here,      take a look at this.",
    "Roasting off this polenta,   and it's about ready to go.",
    "So I'm gonna pull it out, let it cool down a little bit,",
    "and then we'll be able to grill         that in a bit.",
    "All right, now --       Oh, you know what?",
    "I'm forgetting the key      to this whole thing.",
    "Check this out.",
    "Hiding under here...",
    "I started this garlic up on top,",
    "but it wasn't roasting enough.",
    "So down here in the coals,   I've got my roasted garlic.",
    "And we'll just -- Of course,",
    "you got to have garlic        in your cioppino.",
    "Check that out.",
    "I'll just let that chill,     cool down for a second.",
    "Let's grab the seafood.              Okay.",
    "Scallops, halibut, big prawns,",
    "and, of course, Dungeness crab all coming over.",
    "Isn't that beautiful?",
    "Look at that.",
    "So we have the capers,the lemon juice, the white wine,",
    "a little chili flake,  a bunch of garlic, of course.",
    "So let me lower this grate.",
    "♪♪",
    "Okay. A little fennel seeds    were coming off of there.",
    "Now, this is where this kind",
    "of gets into  some decision-making process.",
    "What do I want to add first?",
    "Well, I got the hard shell          of the crab.",
    "and it's pretty industrial.",
    "I mean, it can --  it can handle the heavy heat.",
    "So I'm gonna      throw that on first.",
    "Now I've got some really tender            scallops.",
    "I don't wanna put those on           right now.",
    "That crab's gonna   take a little bit of time.",
    "The shrimp, they're protected     also with their shell,",
    "these prawns, so I'm gonna  go ahead and throw those on.",
    "The scallops      are gonna be the ones",
    "that I'm really gonna wait    just till the last minute",
    "'cause all I want to do  is just char it a little bit.",
    "That sauce is gonna be warm,",
    "so when the scallops          go in there,",
    "they'll just   finish cooking right there.",
    "Look at that. You should smell it right now.",
    "I mean, it smells like a --almost kind of like a crab boil,",
    "or like when you're cooking             some --",
    "some oysters on the grill.",
    "Look at that.",
    "Okay.",
    "And here we go.   I'm gonna put the fish on.",
    "It'll probably go on last       and come off first.",
    "Nestle that right       in on top of there.",
    "And then I'm just gonna holdthose scallops for a little bit.",
    "I'll put those     on at the last minute.",
    "Okay.",
    "Slide that to the side.",
    "Oh.",
    "The flavors, I'm telling you.",
    "Now, I took that garlic,            roasted,",
    "a little bit of salt and pepper.",
    "And this, well, this  can get a little bit sticky.",
    "Trust me,   I've done this enough times",
    "from the days in the restaurant.",
    "All right.",
    "Awesome.     Roasted garlic's down.",
    "Seafood's on the grill.",
    "We are doing grilled cioppino.  People are flying in for it.",
    "It's gonna be a blast!        See ya in a bit.",
    "Welcome back. Man, it is hot       in here right now.",
    "You wouldn't think,        in the holidays,",
    "it's gonna be this warm.",
    "But what we've got goin'      is grilled cioppino.",
    "I'm keeping an eye    on my scallops right now.",
    "So I'm just trying to finish up this fantastic cioppino sauce.",
    "Grilled tomatoes       and red bell pepper",
    "and a little bit of fennel.      Some roasted garlic.",
    "I'll get that later 'cause",
    "I don't want    the scallops to overcook.",
    "Add a little ouzo there because, if you've got a good cioppino,",
    "you know it's got some spice,      it's got some garlic,",
    "and it's got a nice      little anise flavor,",
    "and...Ah.",
    "That is right on.              Okay.",
    "We'll take this.",
    "Gonna pour it right      onto my platter here.",
    "And I've got some grilled     polenta sitting there.",
    "Add a little roasted peppers  to it, add a little Pecorino",
    "cheese to it, let it cool,",
    "put it on a sheet tray, popped it in the oven, put a little --",
    "browned it a little bit,",
    "then took it, cut it in some --",
    "in some squares and grilled it.",
    "Now some beautiful halibut",
    "that's all marinated,           by the way.",
    "leave that right there.",
    "All marinated in some capers,      a little chili flake,",
    "some garlic, some white white,",

    "of the leaf, 'cause the two    leaves would peel apart.",
    "And then taking off the roughedge that may be freezer-burned,",
    "or if it's dried out a little bit, pulling that off.",

    "You could put some onions,",
    "and there could be peppers      in it -- You name it.",

    "get the seeds and the stems       and everything out.",
    "That'll all come together          for a salsa.",
    "Here's what we're talking about,      ladies and gentlemen.",
    "We're talking about",
    "a fantastic Chilean sea bass    wrapped in a banana leaf.",
    "Then we're gonna toss it withsome of this roasted-corn salsa,",
    "and then we take some of those pickled onions on top.",
    "Are you kidding me? All   with a quinoa salad coming   together when you get back.",
    "And if you want to stop   by the house and help with   this, it'd be really nice.",
    "♪♪",
    "This is my healthy show.",
    "We got some red quinoa,",
    "I've got some tri-colored      bell peppers in here,",
    "a little bit of mint          dropping in,",
    "made a touch of dressing",
    "with some Dijon in there and a little bit of olive oil,",
    "and now, this beautiful red quinoa kind of drops right in.",
    "You're gonna love this salad.",
    "So drop that in.",
    "People are flying in for it.       You can hear them.",
    "All right.",
    "Set that aside.",
    "Now give it a quick little mix.",
    "I've got the dressing        already in there.",
    "Look at that.         It's gorgeous.",
    "And the mint really just gonna open that up,",
    "gonna go with that mango            so nice.",
    "A little crunchiness from some of the shallot I threw in there",
    "and a touch of garlic.",
    "Let those kind of work their way       into the dressing.",
    "So really flavorful.",
    "And right there --",
    "Look how beautiful that is, huh?",
    "Mmm.",
    "Outstanding. Outstanding.",
    "All right. Now let's talk       about a corn salsa.",
    "So, I've got this fish   that's finishing right now.",
    "Chilean sea bass.           Outrageous.",
    "What we're gonna dump in here --           red onion,",
    "a little bit of garlic that I already had broken down,",
    "minced it      really nice and fine.",
    "Then I've got    some Fresno chilies here,",
    "as well as poblanos.",
    "And these are just gonna get      a quick little touch.",
    "Here we go.",
    "So give it a touch of salt.",
    "A little agave.",
    "Yep, agave just like       in making tequila.",
    "Okay.",
    "A little zest of some lime.",
    "And this just makes its ownnatural vinaigrette right there.",
    "Okay.",
    "Get this.",
    "I just want to make sure",
    "that I got that agave and that lime working together.",
    "But look at those colors.",
    "Toasted that corn, or roasted  it, right there on the grill.",
    "Okay. Some scallions.",
    "Okay.",
    "All right, we'll drop this in.",
    "Okay.      This is all together.",
    "Now let's take a look --   It's time to grab the fish.",
    "Now, the fish have been wrapped        in banana leaves.",
    "This is my piece.",
    "So I'll show you how beautiful      this is going to be.",
    "We marinated it in a little bitof orange juice and orange zest.",
    "But is that gorgeous or what?",
    "Let's slide that right off.",
    "Natural --    That's your natural foil.",
    "Oh.",
    "A little    of this ground achiote --",
    "So it's a really nice color        coming out of it.",
    "Put some of this quinoa salad       right on the side.",
    "Tell me thatjust doesn't look like confetti,",
    "like a parade in Flavortown.",
    "Now we'll drop a little bit        of the corn salsa",
    "right on top of that.",
    "And then a touch -- and thisis how we started everything off",
    "is with these       pickled red onions.",
    "Now, you've done       pickled red onions,",
    "but have they ever been       that beautiful red?",
    "Take a look at that.",
    "Fresh veggies. Mmm.",
    "That salad is just dynamite.",
    "And the Chilean sea bass --",
    "Remember what I was saying  about the big, flaky pieces?",
    "A little bit of that onion          right on top.",
    "Don't tell anybody it's healthy,           all right?",
    "Just keep going with the, \"Oh, yeah. It tastes delicious.",
    "Must not be good for you.\"",
    "And the kids will eat it up.",
    "You got the grab this one --  footnetwork.com/guysbigbite.",
    "Go healthy. You're gonna love     it. See you next week.",
    "Outstanding.",
    "Welcome to \"Big Bite.\"",
    "You know, the older I get, the  healthier I think I'm eating.",
    "I mean, really.  I'm not even trying to do it.",
    "It's just -- I need it.",
    "So, what's one of the ways   I'm doing that? With fish.",
    "Yeah, not your regular fish       that sounds boring.",
    "You know    this is \"Big Bite\"-style.",
    "We got to big with the flavor,",
    "starting off with a Chilean sea  bass wrapped in a banana leaf",
    "infused with a citrus marinade",
    "cooked on the grill        in a banana leaf",
    "served with a spicy grilled-corn  salsa and pickled red onions.",
    "Now, you want to talk    about flavor on top of    flavor on top of flavor.",
    "On the side, I've got   red-quinoa-and-mango salad.",
    "It's got diced tri-colored    bell peppers, fresh mint,",
    "and Dijon vinaigrette.  I mean, this is so on point.",
    "And this is to prove",
    "that healthy  can actually mean flavorful.",
    "I know. Listen, we start    saying there's gonna be    fish on the menu,",
    "people are like,       \"Eh, I don't know.",
    "Call us when you're having   Philly cheese steak,\" or,   \"When is it taco night?\"",
    "But you know what? The way   we're gonna do this fish,   wrapped in the banana leaf,",
    "you just wait --   Big, big flavor on the way.",
    "So I've sliced up some thin red onions, and here's the kicker.",
    "So the red onions like this,    we're gonna pickle them,",
    "and I love pickled veggies --    giardiniera, you name it.",
    "But here's the thing with these.",
    "They got a nice little color            to them.",
    "What we're gonna do is use    a little bit of this beet",
    "to really bring some real   nice, big, red color to it.",
    "It's not gonna change the flavor            a bunch.",
    "But you know me.       I'm a big beet fan.",
    "Okay. Let's get some vinegar in here.",
    "Apple cider vinegar      is perfect for this.",
    "Why? A little bit of sweetness,         not too harsh.",
    "And I need a good amount.",
    "Add some sugar.",
    "A couple tablespoons of that.",
    "Salt.",
    "And one more thing --   a little black peppercorn.",
    "I don't know,  about a dozen of those. Okay.",
    "Now, I'm not too worried       about it right now.",
    "I'm just gonna drop these in.",
    "Watch it, 'cause they will stain           everything.",
    "Wrong day to wear a white shirt         on \"Big Bite.\"",
    "I don't know      what I was thinking.",
    "So drop those in. Start to  leech out some of that color.",
    "In with the red onions.",
    "We're not gonna let this go           super far.",
    "As soon as we dissolve         and warm it up",
    "and start to pull that color out    of the beets, we're done.",
    "I still want to have the crunch.",
    "Now, you see how there's   not enough liquid in there",
    "and I've got a ton of vinegar?",
    "I'm just gonna hit it   with a little bit of water",
    "just so everything is submerged.",
    "Perfect.",
    "Fantastic. All right.",
    "Now let's get into this fish.              Okay.",
    "I talk about it all the time.Got to have a fishmonger, right?",
    "Look what he got for me today.",
    "Huh? Come on now.",
    "Nice, big filet,",
    "and I'm talking like half  the fish of Chilean sea bass.",
    "Okay, so look at this.",
    "Nice, white, firm fish.        Flaky. Gorgeous.",
    "If you can't get the sea bass, don't stop on the menu idea and say, \"Oh, I'm not gonna do it.\"",
    "Just go ahead and find     yourself -- talk to     your fishmonger,",
    "and find yourself a fish       that's kind of firm",
    "but has got some really nice   flaky texture to it, okay?",
    "So we'll go in half.",
    "A little bit of thebeet already flavoring the fish.",
    "That's fantastic.        Explain that one.",
    "Okay. So these are done.     Now let's talk about --",
    "Now let's talk about making     the marinade for this.",
    "This is gonna be    a really simple marinade.",
    "A couple oranges...      go right into a bowl.",
    "Now, what do we like        about the orange?",
    "We like the zest.    If you can get this zest",
    "and really start to impart          that flavor,",
    "we don't want to put too much     of the citrus in there",
    "because we'll start to, what?     Cook the fish, exactly.",
    "We're not making seviche.",
    "So get a nice little bit    of the zest off of here.",
    "These are pretty big oranges.",
    "I can probably get away        with one of them.",
    "This is where having that juicer     really comes into play.",
    "If you can get it        to fit in there.",
    "Look at that.",
    "Okay.",
    "Now, throwing in     a little achiote paste,",
    "or a little achiote seasoning,          I should say.",
    "There's all different kinds            of this,",
    "but it comes     from the annatto seed.",
    "In this situation,       it's been ground up",
    "with a little bit of spice,   probably a little paprika,",
    "maybe a little cayenne,      maybe a little cumin.",
    "So there will be   different styles out there.   Find the one you like.",
    "But you want to talk      about awesome color?",
    "This is where all your color        is gonna come in.",
    "Okay.",
    "So there we go.",
    "A little of the achiote.",
    "A touch of some cumin.",
    "The flavors are gonna be subtle     working with this fish,",
    "but there's all this flavorcoming in from this banana leaf.",
    "Okay.",
    "Mix that.",
    "A little extra-virgin olive oil        to cut it a bit.",
    "I will be adding salt and pepperto it later when I put thefish in the banana leaf,",
    "But for right now, I'm just letting that dissolve.",
    "There we go.           All right.",
    "Now we're gonna let this        counter-marinade",
    "just about 45 minutes.",
    "Remember, we can over-marinate           this fish.",
    "Even though I didn't use      a ton of the citrus,",
    "it can over-marinate.",
    "So watch yourself.",
    "Look at this white, flaky,           firm fish.",
    "Those thinner pieces --That's usually Ryder's favorite.",
    "There we go.",
    "They cook a little more.   Don't seem so intimidating.",
    "Okay.",
    "Pour the marinade over the top.",
    "The reason for the resealable bag is I can get a lot of work",
    "out of a little bit of marinade       by having the bag.",
    "Because now   I can move it around, okay?",
    "And then if I squeeze out        the excess air --",
    "You see this? Squeezing out that excess air.",
    "Everybody's getting marinated,",
    "one orange, maybe three  tablespoons of the olive oil.",
    "We're in good shape.",
    "So I'll let that set.",
    "Right there.",
    "Now take a look at this.",
    "Take a lookat what's going on here already.",
    "Look at the color already        that's happening",
    "from that little bit of beet      that I put in there.",
    "Okay. That's enough.",
    "It's just gonna continue  to steep in that hot liquid.",
    "So I'll just go ahead, bring itover here, and let it cool down.",
    "Ahh, that's gorgeous, huh?",
    "We'll take the beets out when we eat the pickled onions.",
    "But just for the time being,    we'll just them sit there",
    "and just continue to bring     the color to the dish.",
    "All right. Now let's talk      about the corn salsa.",
    "I got to grab the whole thing.",
    "I got it all.    The bounty of the county.",
    "So what am I gonna love           about this?",
    "Well, the charring the veggies       right off the bat.",
    "So, we'll grab some    of these Fresno chilies,",
    "give them a little squirt       of some olive oil.",
    "A little salt and pepper.",
    "Let me get the poblanos in here,            as well.",
    "Hit those onto the grill --",
    "a cross between hardwood         and briquettes.",
    "Briquettes to give me that long-running temperature.",
    "Hardwood to really bring in       some of the flavor.",
    "So we'll throw these down,    let them start charring.",
    "I've got to husk some corn.      Anybody want to help?",
    "That's what I figured.        Well, come back.",
    "I'll husk the corn,     throw it on the grill.",
    "Poblanos,    we got the Fresnos down.",
    "The beets -- The onions   are pickling in the beets.",
    "And we'll put fish        into banana leaf.",
    "I know it sounds like a mess, but it's gonna be a good time.",
    "See you in a bit.",
    "Oh! Oh!         Hey, hey! Hey!",
    "Right over here! Right here.    Come on over to the sink.",
    "I'm doing the real exciting  piece of rinsing the quinoa.",
    "Yeah, it's a real hot topic.          There we go.",
    "Got to rinse the quinoa   and get rid of the saponin.",
    "Like, what's saponin?",
    "It's this bitter little exterior          on the quinoa",
    "that is probably one    of the reasons a lot of    people don't eat quinoa.",
    "Sometimes, you'll find     quinoa and it already     has that rinsed off it.",
    "But for the most part,      you need to rinse it.",
    "So into some boiling water,and I'm gonna give this a cover.",
    "This beautiful red quinoa's         gonna sit here",
    "and just steam and pop.",
    "You know, the little quinoa     just pop. It's awesome.",
    "So this is all for my what?    Exactly. My healthy show.",
    "The quinoa's gonna    come together, but    you're looking back here",
    "and you're saying,      \"Ooh. What is that?\"",
    "Well, we've got some beets    that are actually sharing",
    "their beautiful color  with some pickled red onions,",
    "and that's all gonna come     together for some fish.",
    "But before we do any of that,",
    "let me get my peppers         off the grill.",
    "Now, I've got some poblano        and some Fresnos,",
    "and these are all gonna be",
    "for this fantastic       charred corn salsa.",
    "Look at that. A little touch of olive oil, salt, and pepper.",
    "Bring them off.  You know the routine, right?",
    "Just a little plastic wrap.",
    "Just fighting it for a second.",
    "This is a great way         to sweat them.",
    "You know, sometimes if you  don't have the plastic wrap,",
    "as long as you can get them",
    "in something that will allow         them to steam,",
    "I've seen people even do it         in a paper bag",
    "or a plastic container that you can close the lid on.",
    "Okay.  Let those steam up like that.",
    "And I'll grab the corn off.",
    "I'm gonna let the corn cool down",
    "before I go and start to cut      all the kernels off.",
    "And I got a nice hot fire going",
    "for some fantastic fish that  I have marinating right here.",
    "So let me --   I'll put these right here.",
    "Okay, fish is here, done.",
    "A little bit of orange juice,  a little bit of orange zest.",
    "That's the real key to it.",
    "So, first thing we're gonna do",
    "is work with this gigantic     elephant in the room --",
    "Actually, I'll take this one.  And that is this banana leaf.",
    "So the banana leaves I had           were fresh.",
    "Sometimes they'll come frozen,     but the idea is to find",
    "the banana leaf that has    some good portions to it.",
    "A good 4-to-5-inch widths.",
    "You're cutting off the backbone, or cutting out the strong seam",
    "of the leaf, 'cause the two    leaves would peel apart.",
    "And then taking off the roughedge that may be freezer-burned,",
    "or if it's dried out a little bit, pulling that off.",
    "So getting some real nice,     clean, durable portions",
    "of the banana leaf,  4 inches by about 10 inches.",
    "Laying the two down and crossing them over the top.",
    "Putting the seafood         in the center,",
    "putting that Chilean sea bass         in the center.",
    "A little touch   of the black pepper, salt.",
    "Folding one over the other     so they're overlapping.",
    "This was the original tinfoil.",
    "This is how     it was all getting done",
    "before we had plastic wrap          and tinfoil.",
    "And then pinning them shut",
    "with a real strong toothpick        or bamboo stick,",
    "and they really hold together             great.",
    "Voilà. Not bad, huh?        Three more to go.",
    "Okay. The last one.",
    "And I know you're looking    at this right now going,",
    "\"Wait a second.    Is it really that easy?\"",
    "It is totally that easy, and  you are gonna love doing this",
    "because depending on, I mean, you could put shrimp in there.",
    "There's so much great flavor  that could be built in there.",
    "You could put some onions,",
    "and there could be peppers      in it -- You name it.",
    "But these stack up super-easy.",
    "Bring them right over here          to the grill.",
    "I'm gonna raise this grill      up here for a second,",
    "'cause I don't want to go            too fast.",
    "I'm trying to get two things         happening here.",
    "I'm trying to get a little bit of steam and I'm trying to get",
    "a little bit of a grill.",
    "So I'm gonna watch this and make sure that it doesn't burn,",
    "that these edges don't get brown   too fast, but look at that.",
    "Right like that.     Fantastic shape. Okay.",
    "Now we'll talk about the quinoa.   Now, I'm a huge quinoa fan.",
    "When my sister Morgan --    She was one that first    taught me about it --",
    "and she just showed all    these different flavors    that you could add to it.",
    "I mean, it's really       a fantastic canvas.",
    "The beauty about it is",
    "is that it'll take on    anything you do with it.",
    "I'm gonna dice these down.  We'll put this all together.",
    "You're gonna get    this super-flavorful fish",
    "steamed in a banana leaf,",
    "a little kiss of that orange         coming through.",
    "You got these pickled onions        gonna go on top.",
    "It's gonna be a fantastic dish,",
    "and we're doing it   all about staying healthy.",
    "I'll see you in a little bit.",
    "\"Welcome back to the 'Slicing,   Chopping, and Dicing Hour.'",
    "I'm Guy.\"",
    "I'm telling you something --",
    "I love the food I make.",
    "I love the style of food,         but it is so --",
    "There is a lot of chopping.",
    "This is food for the people,  meaning that there should be",
    "a lot of people here helping me         with this food.",
    "All right. So, some red bell   pepper, yellow bell pepper,",
    "some mangoes,     some orange bell pepper",
    "all coming together   for this fantastic quinoa.",
    "A little red quinoa in here        that's steaming.",
    "It'll be ready in just a second.",
    "I'm gonna fluff it, lay it out,          let it cool,",
    "and make this awesome salad            with it.",
    "But the star of the show --      Let me show you this.",
    "The star of this healthy show     is my Chilean sea bass,",
    "and not just any sea bass.",
    "First, I marinated it in a little bit of orange juice",
    "with some achiote powder   and a little bit of cumin.",
    "I did a little bit of the zest      so I get some of that",
    "real nice citrusy flavor with not too much of the acid.",
    "Then took it, let it marinate       for about an hour,",
    "hit it with a little salt and pepper,",
    "wrapped it here      in the banana leaves.",
    "Tell me that's not dynamite.",
    "And just use a toothpick         to close it up.",
    "And just letting them sit here    and steam inside of that,",
    "you can see a little bit    of the juice coming out.",
    "It's gonna be fantastic over a little bit of hardwood.",
    "No problem.    Let me get this started.",
    "I've got...this salad        coming together.",
    "It was a lot of prep.    Totally worth it, though.",
    "Here we go. Back of the knife to keep from dulling the blade.",
    "And all those great veggies --    I mean, look at the color",
    "that's gonna be inside of this      with that red quinoa.",
    "Okay.",
    "Some of my red onions back there",
    "sitting   in some of that beet juice.",
    "Oh, dynamite color.",
    "Okay.      Shallots and garlic.",
    "Shallot.",
    "Now, this --",
    "Break it down the same way  that you break down an onion.",
    "Okay?",
    "I'll give it a few slices     right through the side.",
    "Do all the dicing in one shot.",
    "Right on top. Just like     we're working an onion.",
    "Making it really nice and fine",
    "so it'll work its way    into the dressing evenly.",
    "Run it over one more time.",
    "Here we go.",
    "And we'll drop that in        for the dressing.",
    "Same thing --   Got to go with some garlic.",
    "Just coming to give it      a little rough chop.",
    "The idea is to really break down           the garlic.",
    "Okay.",
    "Okay. That comes together. Let  me get a little salt in here.",
    "A little black pepper.",
    "We're gonna need       a touch of mustard.",
    "The mustard's nice",
    "because it always helps in the emulsification side of it.",
    "So we get a little bit of Dijon,    a little white balsamic.",
    "There we go.",
    "Okay. So that's all mixed up nicely.",
    "Now a touch   of extra virgin olive oil.",
    "Putting in that mustard,",
    "it'll help bring the oil    and the vinegar together.",
    "Okay? We all know that     from making a dressing.",
    "A little taste.",
    "That's spot-on.     Exactly what I wanted.",
    "Crunchy of the vegs,       sweet of the mango,",
    "a little kiss of the mustard, definitely the garlic in there,",
    "shallots, and that'll all  mellow out here in a second.",
    "Okay.     Let's get into quinoa.",
    "So...    Yeah, that's a good size.",
    "This is red quinoa.",
    "I rinsed it first...",
    "to get   that little bitter taste --",
    "Everybody's had that bitter    taste before from quinoa.",
    "Okay?",
    "Some quinoa will come pre-rinsed     for you. I don't know.",
    "I can go with the old-fashioned  stuff and do my own rinsing.",
    "Okay?",
    "Feather it out.",
    "Kind of like doing with rice,",
    "just kind of letting it finish      its steaming process.",
    "It'll kind of separate a little   bit. It won't be so clumpy.",
    "But look at that.",
    "Mmm. Nice and nutty.",
    "Okay. So we'll set this off          to the side.",
    "Now let's talk      about these peppers.",
    "So I've got some poblanos        and some Fresnos,",
    "threw them on the grill,",
    "a little bit of olive oil,salt and pepper, let them steam.",
    "You know what that does?   It just kicks off the skin.",
    "This is all gonna come together     with this roasted corn.",
    "So I've got to cut the kernels          off the corn,",
    "got to take and skin       these peppers down,",
    "get the seeds and the stems       and everything out.",
    "That'll all come together          for a salsa.",
    "Here's what we're talking about,      ladies and gentlemen.",
    "We're talking about",
    "a fantastic Chilean sea bass    wrapped in a banana leaf.",
    "Then we're gonna toss it withsome of this roasted-corn salsa,",
    "and then we take some of those pickled onions on top.",
    "Are you kidding me? All   with a quinoa salad coming   together when you get back.",
    "And if you want to stop   by the house and help with   this, it'd be really nice.",
    "This is my healthy show.",
    "We got some red quinoa,",
    "I've got some tri-colored      bell peppers in here,",
    "a little bit of mint          dropping in,",
    "made a touch of dressing",
    "with some Dijon in there and a little bit of olive oil,",
    "and now, this beautiful red quinoa kind of drops right in.",
    "You're gonna love this salad.",
    "So drop that in.",
    "People are flying in for it.       You can hear them.",
    "All right.",
    "Set that aside.",
    "Now give it a quick little mix.",
    "I've got the dressing        already in there.",
    "Look at that.         It's gorgeous.",
    "And the mint really just gonna open that up,",
    "gonna go with that mango            so nice.",
    "A little crunchiness from some of the shallot I threw in there",
    "and a touch of garlic.",
    "Let those kind of work their way       into the dressing.",
    "So really flavorful.",
    "And right there --",
    "Look how beautiful that is, huh?",
    "Mmm.",
    "Outstanding. Outstanding.",
    "All right. Now let's talk       about a corn salsa.",
    "So, I've got this fish   that's finishing right now.",
    "Chilean sea bass.           Outrageous.",
    "What we're gonna dump in here --           red onion,",
    "a little bit of garlic that I already had broken down,",
    "minced it      really nice and fine.",
    "Then I've got    some Fresno chilies here,",
    "as well as poblanos.",
    "And these are just gonna get      a quick little touch.",
    "Here we go.",
    "So give it a touch of salt.",
    "A little agave.",
    "Yep, agave just like       in making tequila.",
    "Okay.",
    "A little zest of some lime.",
    "And this just makes its ownnatural vinaigrette right there.",
    "Okay.",
    "Get this.",
    "I just want to make sure",
    "that I got that agave and that lime working together.",
    "But look at those colors.",
    "Toasted that corn, or roasted  it, right there on the grill.",
    "Okay. Some scallions.",
    "Okay.",
    "All right, we'll drop this in.",
    "Okay.      This is all together.",
    "Now let's take a look --   It's time to grab the fish.",
    "Now, the fish have been wrapped        in banana leaves.",
    "This is my piece.",
    "So I'll show you how beautiful      this is going to be.",
    "We marinated it in a little bitof orange juice and orange zest.",
    "But is that gorgeous or what?",
    "Let's slide that right off.",
    "Natural --    That's your natural foil.",
    "Oh.",
    "A little    of this ground achiote --",
    "So it's a really nice color        coming out of it.",
    "Put some of this quinoa salad       right on the side.",
    "Tell me thatjust doesn't look like confetti,",
    "like a parade in Flavortown.",
    "Now we'll drop a little bit        of the corn salsa",
    "right on top of that.",
    "And then a touch -- and thisis how we started everything off",
    "is with these       pickled red onions.",
    "Now, you've done       pickled red onions,",
    "but have they ever been       that beautiful red?",
    "Take a look at that.",
    "Fresh veggies. Mmm.",
    "That salad is just dynamite.",
    "And the Chilean sea bass --",
    "Remember what I was saying  about the big, flaky pieces?",
    "A little bit of that onion          right on top.",
    "Don't tell anybody it's healthy,           all right?",
    "Just keep going with the, \"Oh, yeah. It tastes delicious.",
    "Must not be good for you.\"",
    "And the kids will eat it up.",
    "You got the grab this one --  footnetwork.com/guysbigbite.",
    "Go healthy. You're gonna love     it. See you next week.",
    "Outstanding.",
    "Holidays are all about     tradition, you know?",
    "Now, Thanksgiving tradition,  what is it?",
    "Well, the one main thing is   we have a huge feast,",
    "but the tradition is kind of  the fact that we don't really",
    "have any traditions--    it usually just involves",
    "me cooking for all     my friends and family,",
    "and that's what        we got this year,",
    "starting off with my balsamic  braised leg of lamb,",
    "cooked in a pressure cooker   for maximum tenderness,",
    "served with a rich,     tangy balsamic glaze--",
    "oh, you're gonna love it.",
    "Now, to go alongside, how about sweet potato gnocchi",
    "in a parmesan butter sauce?",
    "Oh, you're definitely coming  back for seconds on this,",
    "and to round it all out,    I'll whip up some peas",
    "and prosciutto,      a little lemon zest,      a little chile flake.",
    "Super simple,    but everybody loves this.",
    "Sweet potatoes gotta chill out here for a little bit,",
    "because they're a little    hot to the touch,",
    "and that's gonna come    together for the gnocchi.",
    "Just...wow, I don't even wanna start you on that.",
    "Let's talk about this balsamic braised leg of lamb.",
    "So pressure cooker, you know,  it's one of my favorite  utensils to use,",
    "and I've got this screamin' hotstove out here,",
    "but you don't need       a really hot stove.",
    "All you need is     a pressure cooker that     can handle everything.",
    "So get some heat goin'.",
    "Little bit of olive oil,",
    "and let's talk about      leg of lamb.",
    "I remember when I was a kid,  my dad cooked leg of lamb.",
    "Took the whole leg,       hoof and all,",
    "stuffed it with garlic,   roasted it on the barbecue,",
    "and I just remember askin'   my friends at school,",
    "\"So what'd you have       for Thanksgiving?\"",
    "And everybody said, \"Well, we had the turkey and so far.\"",
    "I said, \"We had leg of lamb.\"",
    "People just looked at me   cross-eyed, but that's just   the way it's always been.",
    "So for the leg of lamb,     we're talkin' about     a whole leg of lamb.",
    "Had the butcher bone it out,  but I kept the bone.",
    "It's nice and trim,     not too much fat on it.",
    "Liberal with      the salt and pepper.",
    "Fresh cracked black pepper.",
    "Now the key was to really    sear off the lamb.",
    "I only did two pieces at a timeto build a really nice crust.",
    "We'll drop those in.",
    "Takes a little bit of time,   didn't pre-flour that.",
    "Remember, I want that crust   to build on the meat.",
    "So we'll turn that      a few times, okay?      Let me wash my hands.",
    "Okay.       Now to the gnocchi.",
    "So great thing about    sweet potatoes is, well,",
    "people get them mixed up    all the time.",
    "Is it a yam?      Is it a sweet potato?",
    "Well, we're talkin' about   the sweet potato, a little   less starchy than the yam.",
    "So the idea here is cook    these off ahead of time,",
    "or maybe you have        some left over.",
    "We're gonna get 'em cool    to the touch,",
    "just to where we can kinda   handle them a little bit.",
    "Poked some holes in 'em,  roasted 'em off in the oven,",
    "just the normal way you'd   cook 'em, and look at that.",
    "Look at that beautiful color,  huh?",
    "Take this...",
    "into the bowl.",
    "Some grated parm.",
    "Maybe about 1 cup.",
    "A little olive oil,",
    "a couple tablespoons of that.",
    "A little brown sugar--     I know that we have",
    "the sweetness of   the sweet potato goin' on,",
    "but a little brown sugar    will go a long way.",
    "A little salt and pepper,    there we go.",
    "And here's where     we really start adding",
    "the subtle flavor,  but the flavor that  everybody'll go, like, \"Why?",
    "Why does this gnocchi taste   so fantastic?\"",
    "It's this--we're gonna     use a little thyme,     a little fresh thyme.",
    "So a little bit of thyme,",
    "and last but not least,",
    "you say holidays,       what do you think?       You think nutmeg.",
    "Okay, lock that down.",
    "Let that slowly whip together  there for a second.",
    "Turn it up.",
    "We're gonna really       let that fluff up.",
    "We're really gonna put a lot ofair into that and aerate it.",
    "It's gonna be nice and--that'llhelp it get nice and creamy,",
    "'cause remember, on a gnocchi, you don't want those dense,",
    "little hard pillows--you want itto be nice, light, and fluffy.",
    "All right, back over here.",
    "Lamb's got a nice sear to it.",
    "To the other side.",
    "Okay.",
    "Take the bling off.",
    "There we go.",
    "Now this right here looks like pumpkin pie filling,",
    "just in the savory sense.",
    "Bring this off.",
    "Need a little bench flour here.",
    "Now, I was gonna be using maybeup to 2 cups of flour for this,",
    "but we're really gonna be  looking for what the texture",
    "of this is gonna look like.",
    "We want it to be      a little bit pliable.",
    "Seems like a little now,    but there's a ton    of flavor in that.",
    "Again, just the opportunityto repurpose that sweet potato.",
    "Could've been left over--    you know how you have",
    "the big Thanksgiving party   the night before?",
    "Well, the great thing is,    you can cook off    those sweet potatoes,",
    "had 'em done and ready to go,  just one less thing",
    "that you have to cook on   that actual big turkey day.",
    "All right.",
    "There we go.",
    "Need a little more flour...",
    "right up on top of that.",
    "Lightly start putting it    together.",
    "Oh, this is perfect.",
    "Okay, so here's the game plan.",
    "Still searing off the lamb.",
    "Don't worry, the balsamic part'scoming in just a little bit.",
    "What I'm gonna do is continue  to add flour to this.",
    "Knead this dough through,   get it into a floured bowl,",
    "and let it rest for about   30 minutes, you come back,",
    "it's, uh, Thanksgiving day   at the Fieri house,",
    "uh, at the ranch,     you're gonna love this.",
    "I needed more flour,      and now the hands are      already gummy.",
    "Can you give me a hand?     I'll get it.",
    "Welcome back--   Thanksgiving at the ranch.",
    "I'll tell ya something--    making gnocchi,",
    "it takes a lot of time--well, it doesn't take a lot of time, it takes patience,",
    "because you're working withsomething really super delicate,",
    "so what I've got here is some  sweet potatoes I cooked  ahead of time,",
    "made this fantastic little   mixture with a little bit   of thyme,",
    "a lot of parmesan cheese,    and some olive oil,",
    "and now I'm just lightly    kneading in the flour.",
    "It's not an exact science,   because I don't know how   many sweet potatoes",
    "I'm gonna have and how wet   they're going to be,",
    "so I'm just working them enough,just to where they're not tacky,",
    "and I'm gonna be able to start to roll them out to make",
    "those little dumplings--    now, over there,",
    "you hear sizzling and popping  going on for a good reason,  because that's going to be--",
    "well, this is       the non-traditional",
    "Thanksgiving here at the house,and that is going to be",
    "a balsamic-braised leg of lamb,",
    "and I think that just      covers that.",
    "Okay.",
    "This...",
    "a touch of flour        inside the bowl,",
    "pick that up,      let it just rest here",
    "for just, ah,     maybe about 30 minutes.",
    "And bones out of the oven.",
    "Now, I had this--",
    "I had this fantastic      leg of lamb",
    "that I had the butcher go    and break down for me.",
    "What I had him do is take it  and just really nicely--",
    "he just opened it up,      took the leg out,",
    "gave me all the meat,trimmed a little bit of the fat,",
    "and that's what's     taking place over here,",
    "as I've got this leg of lamb  that I've been searing off.",
    "Look at that--look at the nice caramelization and crunch.",
    "I couldn't fit the bone     in there.",
    "I mean, I'm going to fit    the bone in there,    but I couldn't really",
    "get the roast on it,    so throw it in the oven,",
    "regular oven, wood-fired oven, doesn't matter.",
    "Okay, now we get into    this balsamic braised...",
    "Little bit of jalapeno--  it just--we're gonna go with",
    "a nice rough cut.",
    "All these veggies,     because we're gonna     strain this out later.",
    "Red bell pepper.",
    "The real key is coming up here in just a second,",
    "and that's gonna be       the balsamic.",
    "There we go.",
    "A little bit of onion.",
    "This could all be done     ahead of time also.",
    "A little fennel.",
    "Fennel goes in this       really great.",
    "Think about mixin'       that balsamic...",
    "Okay.",
    "A little chopped garlic.",
    "Don't wanna chop it down too much, 'cause they've gotta",
    "survive in this pot       and not burn.",
    "We're gonna let this all    sweat right now.",
    "I'm gonna bring the heat up   just a touch.",
    "One of my favorite things   to work with in the kitchen",
    "is the pressure cooker,",
    "so what I've done here is    gotten a leg of lamb,",
    "had it boned out,       and cooked it down",
    "with this really nice      balsamic reduction.",
    "We start with some tomato paste,1/2 cup,",
    "a little molasses--     that's the real kicker.",
    "Maybe 2 tablespoons--      one...",
    "two.",
    "Some beef stock--",
    "1 quart, low sodium.",
    "Remember, we seasoned--     liberally, we seasoned     that lamb.",
    "And, of course,     some balsamic vinegar.",
    "This is flavor city       right here, folks.",
    "Okay, about 2 cups of that.",
    "And then drop the meat",
    "back in     with all the aromatics,",
    "with all that big flavor,    and so now,",
    "back in, nestle all of     these inside.",
    "You gotta be conscious of this--if you're gonna go to the top,",
    "you only can go      about 3/4 of the way,",
    "and then I'm gonna throw    the bones right in there",
    "for good flavor on top of it.",
    "We will lock    the pressure cooker down.",
    "Okay, now here's        the key to this.",
    "Every pressure cooker's     different, get to know     your pressure cooker.",
    "Become friends with      your pressure cooker,",
    "because here's what happens--  we're gonna get this up",
    "to about 15psi,  and that's the perfect time--",
    "perfect pressure to cook it  with, and about medium heat,",
    "about 45 minutes, gonna be   super shred-apart tender.",
    "Come back, gonna do gnocchi,  I'll clean all this up.",
    "We're having the un-traditionaltraditional Thanksgiving",
    "at the Fieri house--      see you in a bit.",
    "Welcome back tothe un-traditional Thanksgiving.",
    "Ah, listen, this is where    it should be a tradition,",
    "because this dish is outrageous.",
    "So what I'm doing is I've takena little prosciutto,",
    "and I'm gonna crisp it up here,and this is one of",
    "my favorite Italian dishes.",
    "You take the prosciutto,    which everybody loves    prosciutto,",
    "but not a lot of people     have had it cooked.",
    "So you slice it thin and then cut some julienne strips of it",
    "and cook that down,    you get this really nice,",
    "salty, almost crunchy      like bacon.",
    "Get that in...",
    "Let me get...        the shallots in.",
    "There we go, and we'll just letthis mellow out for a second.",
    "What I have here    is the star of the show,",
    "and it's the lamb--     now the lamb's been in",
    "the pressure cooker     for, oh, I don't know,",
    "about 45 minutes--   big, beautiful leg of lamb.",
    "Had the local butcher take it,",
    "debone it for me.",
    "Now I've got it in the pressurecooker with a little molasses,",
    "some beef broth, we've got...",
    "a little balsamic--  actually, a lot of balsamic.",
    "Now you see what I just did   right there?",
    "I've been braising that.    First I seared it off,    a little salt, pepper,",
    "seared it off with a little  olive oil, I've got jalapenos",
    "and some onions      and some bell pepper,      some fennel.",
    "Oh, the fennel and the balsamicgo together great,but what I did is",
    "I just dropped it in here,and cooling down the temperature",
    "and releasing the steam,    I'm gonna be able    to open this up",
    "a lot quicker than I would  normally be able to if I just",
    "released the steam on the stove.",
    "You hear that?       Aw, it's fantastic.",
    "Best trick in the world,    'cause a lot of times,",
    "you're sittin' there, waitin'for it to just kinda decompress",
    "before you can get it to open, so let's see...",
    "let's see if we're       successful with it.",
    "Voila, so you took it    from super screamin' hot",
    "at 15 pounds per square inch,  the normal temp--",
    "the normal pressure   that you'd be cooking   in a pressure cooker with--",
    "and brought it down that quick by the ice bath.",
    "Okay.",
    "So here's that leg of lamb.",
    "And when I say",
    "fall-apart tender,    I can barely get it out.",
    "Have to bring this over here.",
    "Oh, just gorgeous.",
    "Now, I even took the bones,   the leg bone,",
    "and roasted it off.",
    "Oh! This is exactly    what we're talkin' about.",
    "All kinds of flavor built    into the bottom of this.",
    "Get the last little bits here,",
    "and all that marrow insidethe legs, you know that's where",
    "the flavor's comin' from, okay.",
    "Let me hold this off      to the side.",
    "There.",
    "Another pan,  gonna strain the liquid now.",
    "You really gotta remember    that little technique",
    "that I was just showing you   about throwing it   in the ice bath.",
    "I tell ya, I've watched so manypeople sit there, I was like,",
    "is the pressure cooker done?  Is it done? Is it done?",
    "That way right there,we did it in literally seconds.",
    "Okay.",
    "The last little bit of     the braising liquid.",
    "Perfect.",
    "And back onto the stove.    Okay.",
    "Now back to where we were.",
    "The shallots, cookin' down   with the prosciutto.",
    "If I threw the garlic in there when I put the shallots in,",
    "you're gonna have     that opportunity     for it to go and burn,",
    "so now that I'm back to paying attention to it...",
    "throw my garlic in.",
    "Touch more of the extra virgin olive oil.",
    "The flavor alone right here--let me throw some heat on that,",
    "reduce it just a bit more.",
    "But look at the viscosity    of that.",
    "Just a little bit of oil there,but all that fat cookin' down",
    "from that leg of lamb...",
    "A little chile flake.",
    "And I don't care if it's    Thanksgiving or not,",
    "you are gonna try this pea   recipe, 'cause you know how",
    "prosciutto has that real    distinct flavor to it?",
    "The saltiness,      the rich meat flavor?",
    "You do that, and then you drop--you drop...",
    "Now, if you can get some    fresh peas, go with it,",
    "but this time of year,     you can't.",
    "Frozen peas.    I'm not a canned pea guy.",
    "They're too mushy--frozen peas,they're kinda frozen",
    "at the moment of ripeness.",
    "Right in...aw, yeah.",
    "Everybody in my family     loves this dish.",
    "Okay.",
    "And all really    I'm going to do on these",
    "is just warm 'em up, 'cause I've cooked the garlic,",
    "cooked the shallots,   got the crispy prosciutto.",
    "Let it be.",
    "Now, second star,    the co-host of the show,",
    "is this fantastic gnocchi.",
    "We throw a little        bench flour down.",
    "Now, if you remember, the way  I started things off is I had",
    "some leftover sweet potatoes,",
    "and if you don't, cook 'em   and then just let 'em cool.",
    "So I took the sweet potatoes,  hit 'em with some  parmesan cheese,",
    "some olive oil,        some fresh thyme,",
    "kneaded it in   a little bit of the flour,",
    "and then I let it rest there  in a floured bowl.",
    "Now, cut off a manageable piece,",
    "a little bit of flour,  and what we're lookin' for--",
    "let me just kinda show you   the doughiness of this.",
    "It's kinda tender        like a pillow.",
    "Not dense, not hard--    for the size that it is,",
    "it's really kinda nice   and light, kinda feels like",
    "it might be a pastry,      so I'm just gonna",
    "lightly roll this out.     There we go.",
    "A little bit more manageable  piece to work with.",
    "Uniform size      so they cook equally.",
    "Okay? And we'll just knock off",
    "little 1-inch pieces.",
    "There we go.",
    "About 1 tablespoon of salt   to a gallon of water.",
    "Remember that,    and you definitely    need it with the gnocchi.",
    "Start droppin' these little   dumplings down.",
    "When they float,     they're gonna be done.",
    "We're gonna work 'em in batches,pull 'em out, let 'em cool.",
    "It's all comin' together.  The meat's done, shred that.",
    "Got the peas over here     with the prosciutto.",
    "Reducing the glaze mixture.   Huh.",
    "Un-traditional, but definitely will be a tradition",
    "at your family, I bet--  I'll see you in a little bit.",
    "We'll tie this all up.",
    "That's how I want 'em done.",
    "Beautiful gnocchi,      sweet potato gnocchi",
    "with a little bit of thyme   and parmesan cheese,",
    "all comin' together forthe traditional un-traditional,",
    "uh, items that we make here at the Fieri house, at the ranch,",
    "for Thanksgiving--       now look at those.",
    "A little bit of saltwater,   took the sweet potato,",
    "mixed up the parmesan cheese,  gonna let these rest  for just a second.",
    "Got some of that braising liquidreduced for the fantastic lamb",
    "sitting down there--here's  the peas and the prosciutto.",
    "This is what happens    all the time, people pick    all the prosciutto",
    "right out of the top.      Fantastic.",
    "Now, let me tell you      about this one thing",
    "I gotta do, gotta hit      a little lemon zest",
    "right on top of the peas    and prosciutto.",
    "Nice and salty.",
    "Frozen peas, wish that they werefresh, but they're really--",
    "frozen's way better       than the can.",
    "A little bit of chile flake   in there, and this little   lemon zest",
    "at the end, just...       adds that",
    "nice little citrus note--    not the citrus, but just",
    "that lemony oil...okay.",
    "Gnocchi, I'm just lettin' 'em  cool for a second.",
    "Over here, I've got     a little brown butter.",
    "So what I did is I started   a pan--I'm gonna fire it   back up now--",
    "I started a cold pan,  dropped the butter in there,",
    "and then slowly let it brown.",
    "If you drop the butter     into a hot pan,",
    "automatically starts to brown, automatically starts",
    "to turn on you, and then    you're chasing it down.",
    "So this right here,   I've got it rendered down,",
    "I got a bunch of heat on it,",
    "get it right to the brown butterlook that I'm lookin' for.",
    "It's gettin' nice        and golden, okay.",
    "Gets that little        nuttiness to it.",
    "Now we'll go ahead...",
    "drop this in,",
    "and just giving these a chance to cool down a little bit,",
    "just to dry out the touch.",
    "The thyme in there,     and all we're gonna do",
    "is just coat this a little bit.",
    "I gotta grab      some parmesan cheese.",
    "Okay, let that coat       up a little bit.",
    "A little more heat    on that braising liquid.",
    "A little parm on top of that,  and that's all she wrote.",
    "They're already nice      and warm, okay.",
    "Now...",
    "bring this over to the lamb.",
    "So I've got that balsamic--   the balsamic braised lamb",
    "that I took the leg of lamb,  had it boned out,",
    "kept the bone,    roasted that in the oven,",
    "then took the lamb, seared it  off in the pressure cooker,",
    "hit it with a bunch of veggies,got some peppersand some fennel.",
    "Gotta love that in there.",
    "Then went with some onions and some garlic, little bit of",
    "the jalapeno, then came in  with the balsamic, of course,",
    "that's the name,    but the key little hid--",
    "the little bit hiding    in there is the molasses.",
    "Oh! Of course,   some beef stock made it in.",
    "There's that tender,      pillowy gnocchi.",
    "Last little bit.",
    "Some of the brown butter.",
    "Look at that.",
    "Look at that.",
    "Spoon that right over the top.",
    "You've got--I'm telling you,  talk about tender lamb.",
    "I mean,   it's just fork-fall-apart,",
    "and you know that everybody's  got their traditions  and what they like.",
    "Our family,  we just can't stick with one.",
    "Oh, we'll do a couple of    the basics, but I gotta    tell you something,",
    "just the way that this is    lookin' right now,",
    "this might make it--this might make it to next year's menu.",
    "All right, let's give this   a little taste.",
    "All right.    Nobody's lookin', right?",
    "You're not supposed to eat off the platter. I know the rules.",
    "First, that little pillow.",
    "Sweet potato.",
    "Mm.",
    "Melt in your mouth.",
    "Light, super flavorful.",
    "Fresh thyme--that's the kicker.",
    "And right--little bit      of parmesan cheese      for the saltiness.",
    "Okay.",
    "There's also a touch      of nutmeg in there.",
    "But look at this,  when you get this leg of lamb",
    "that just--that, I mean,   it looks like pulled pork.",
    "Huh?",
    "That's winner      winner lamb dinner.      I'm tellin' you what.",
    "The holidays are an incredibly important time,",
    "time to give thanks,  time to be with your family,",
    "time to be with your friends-- no way better for me",
    "than to show my friends and family how much I love 'em",
    "than makin' a dish like that,  look at that.",
    "Scratch-made, homemade,     real deal, right here.",
    "You're gonna get this recipe.  Have a great Thanksgiving.",
    "Thanks for watchin'       \"Guy's Big Bite.\"",
    "I'll see ya next time.",
    "♪♪",
    "♪♪",
    "Holidays are all about     tradition, you know?",
    "Now, Thanksgiving tradition,  what is it?",
    "Well, the one main thing is   we have a huge feast,",
    "but the tradition is kind of  the fact that we don't really",
    "have any traditions--    it usually just involves",
    "me cooking for all     my friends and family,",
    "and that's what        we got this year,",
    "starting off with my balsamic  braised leg of lamb,",
    "cooked in a pressure cooker   for maximum tenderness,",
    "served with a rich,     tangy balsamic glaze--",
    "oh, you're gonna love it.",
    "Now, to go alongside, how about sweet potato gnocchi",
    "in a parmesan butter sauce?",
    "Oh, you're definitely coming  back for seconds on this,",
    "and to round it all out,    I'll whip up some peas",
    "and prosciutto,      a little lemon zest,      a little chile flake.",
    "Super simple,    but everybody loves this.",
    "Sweet potatoes gotta chill out here for a little bit,",
    "because they're a little    hot to the touch,",
    "and that's gonna come    together for the gnocchi.",
    "Just...wow, I don't even wanna start you on that.",
    "Let's talk about this balsamic braised leg of lamb.",
    "So pressure cooker, you know,  it's one of my favorite  utensils to use,",
    "and I've got this screamin' hotstove out here,",
    "but you don't need       a really hot stove.",
    "All you need is     a pressure cooker that     can handle everything.",
    "So get some heat goin'.",
    "Little bit of olive oil,",
    "and let's talk about      leg of lamb.",
    "I remember when I was a kid,  my dad cooked leg of lamb.",
    "Took the whole leg,       hoof and all,",
    "stuffed it with garlic,   roasted it on the barbecue,",
    "and I just remember askin'   my friends at school,",
    "\"So what'd you have       for Thanksgiving?\"",
    "And everybody said, \"Well, we had the turkey and so far.\"",
    "I said, \"We had leg of lamb.\"",
    "People just looked at me   cross-eyed, but that's just   the way it's always been.",
    "So for the leg of lamb,     we're talkin' about     a whole leg of lamb.",
    "Had the butcher bone it out,  but I kept the bone.",
    "It's nice and trim,     not too much fat on it.",
    "Liberal with      the salt and pepper.",
    "Fresh cracked black pepper.",
    "Now the key was to really    sear off the lamb.",
    "I only did two pieces at a timeto build a really nice crust.",
    "We'll drop those in.",
    "Takes a little bit of time,   didn't pre-flour that.",
    "Remember, I want that crust   to build on the meat.",
    "So we'll turn that      a few times, okay?      Let me wash my hands.",
    "Okay.       Now to the gnocchi.",
    "So great thing about    sweet potatoes is, well,",
    "people get them mixed up    all the time.",
    "Is it a yam?      Is it a sweet potato?",
    "Well, we're talkin' about   the sweet potato, a little   less starchy than the yam.",
    "So the idea here is cook    these off ahead of time,",
    "or maybe you have        some left over.",
    "We're gonna get 'em cool    to the touch,",
    "just to where we can kinda   handle them a little bit.",
    "♪♪",
    "Poked some holes in 'em,  roasted 'em off in the oven,",
    "just the normal way you'd   cook 'em, and look at that.",
    "Look at that beautiful color,  huh?",
    "Take this...",
    "into the bowl.",
    "♪♪",
    "Some grated parm.",
    "Maybe about 1 cup.",
    "A little olive oil,",
    "a couple tablespoons of that.",
    "A little brown sugar--     I know that we have",
    "the sweetness of   the sweet potato goin' on,",
    "but a little brown sugar    will go a long way.",
    "A little salt and pepper,    there we go.",
    "And here's where     we really start adding",
    "the subtle flavor,  but the flavor that  everybody'll go, like, \"Why?",
    "Why does this gnocchi taste   so fantastic?\"",
    "It's this--we're gonna     use a little thyme,     a little fresh thyme.",
    "♪♪",
    "So a little bit of thyme,",
    "and last but not least,",
    "you say holidays,       what do you think?       You think nutmeg.",
    "Okay, lock that down.",
    "Let that slowly whip together  there for a second.",
    "[whirring noises]",
    "Turn it up.",
    "We're gonna really       let that fluff up.",
    "We're really gonna put a lot ofair into that and aerate it.",
    "It's gonna be nice and--that'llhelp it get nice and creamy,",
    "'cause remember, on a gnocchi, you don't want those dense,",
    "little hard pillows--you want itto be nice, light, and fluffy.",
    "All right, back over here.",
    "Lamb's got a nice sear to it.",
    "[sizzling noises]",
    "To the other side.",
    "Okay.",
    "Take the bling off.",
    "[whirring noises]",
    "[whirring stops]",
    "There we go.",
    "Now this right here looks like pumpkin pie filling,",
    "just in the savory sense.",
    "Bring this off.",
    "Need a little bench flour here.",
    "Now, I was gonna be using maybeup to 2 cups of flour for this,",
    "but we're really gonna be  looking for what the texture",
    "of this is gonna look like.",
    "We want it to be      a little bit pliable.",
    "Seems like a little now,    but there's a ton    of flavor in that.",
    "Again, just the opportunityto repurpose that sweet potato.",
    "Could've been left over--    you know how you have",
    "the big Thanksgiving party   the night before?",
    "Well, the great thing is,    you can cook off    those sweet potatoes,",
    "had 'em done and ready to go,  just one less thing",
    "that you have to cook on   that actual big turkey day.",
    "All right.",
    "♪♪",
    "There we go.",
    "Need a little more flour...",
    "right up on top of that.",
    "Lightly start putting it    together.",
    "Oh, this is perfect.",
    "Okay, so here's the game plan.",
    "Still searing off the lamb.",
    "Don't worry, the balsamic part'scoming in just a little bit.",
    "What I'm gonna do is continue  to add flour to this.",
    "Knead this dough through,   get it into a floured bowl,",
    "and let it rest for about   30 minutes, you come back,",
    "it's, uh, Thanksgiving day   at the Fieri house,",
    "uh, at the ranch,     you're gonna love this.",
    "I needed more flour,      and now the hands are      already gummy.",
    "Can you give me a hand?     I'll get it.",
    "♪♪",
    "♪♪",
    "Welcome back--   Thanksgiving at the ranch.",
    "I'll tell ya something--    making gnocchi,",
    "it takes a lot of time--well, it doesn't take a lot of time, it takes patience,",
    "because you're working withsomething really super delicate,",
    "so what I've got here is some  sweet potatoes I cooked  ahead of time,",
    "made this fantastic little   mixture with a little bit   of thyme,",
    "a lot of parmesan cheese,    and some olive oil,",
    "and now I'm just lightly    kneading in the flour.",
    "It's not an exact science,   because I don't know how   many sweet potatoes",
    "I'm gonna have and how wet   they're going to be,",
    "so I'm just working them enough,just to where they're not tacky,",
    "and I'm gonna be able to start to roll them out to make",
    "those little dumplings--    now, over there,",
    "you hear sizzling and popping  going on for a good reason,  because that's going to be--",
    "well, this is       the non-traditional",
    "Thanksgiving here at the house,and that is going to be",
    "a balsamic-braised leg of lamb,",
    "and I think that just      covers that.",
    "Okay.",
    "This...",
    "a touch of flour        inside the bowl,",
    "pick that up,      let it just rest here",
    "for just, ah,     maybe about 30 minutes.",
    "And bones out of the oven.",
    "Now, I had this--",
    "I had this fantastic      leg of lamb",
    "that I had the butcher go    and break down for me.",
    "What I had him do is take it  and just really nicely--",
    "he just opened it up,      took the leg out,",
    "gave me all the meat,trimmed a little bit of the fat,",
    "and that's what's     taking place over here,",
    "as I've got this leg of lamb  that I've been searing off.",
    "Look at that--look at the nice caramelization and crunch.",
    "I couldn't fit the bone     in there.",
    "I mean, I'm going to fit    the bone in there,    but I couldn't really",
    "get the roast on it,    so throw it in the oven,",
    "regular oven, wood-fired oven, doesn't matter.",
    "Okay, now we get into    this balsamic braised...",
    "Little bit of jalapeno--  it just--we're gonna go with",
    "a nice rough cut.",
    "All these veggies,     because we're gonna     strain this out later.",
    "Red bell pepper.",
    "The real key is coming up here in just a second,",
    "and that's gonna be       the balsamic.",
    "There we go.",
    "A little bit of onion.",
    "This could all be done     ahead of time also.",
    "A little fennel.",
    "Fennel goes in this       really great.",
    "Think about mixin'       that balsamic...",
    "Okay.",
    "A little chopped garlic.",
    "Don't wanna chop it down too much, 'cause they've gotta",
    "survive in this pot       and not burn.",
    "We're gonna let this all    sweat right now.",
    "I'm gonna bring the heat up   just a touch.",
    "One of my favorite things   to work with in the kitchen",
    "is the pressure cooker,",
    "so what I've done here is    gotten a leg of lamb,",
    "had it boned out,       and cooked it down",
    "with this really nice      balsamic reduction.",
    "We start with some tomato paste,1/2 cup,",
    "a little molasses--     that's the real kicker.",
    "Maybe 2 tablespoons--      one...",
    "two.",
    "Some beef stock--",
    "1 quart, low sodium.",
    "Remember, we seasoned--     liberally, we seasoned     that lamb.",
    "And, of course,     some balsamic vinegar.",
    "This is flavor city       right here, folks.",
    "Okay, about 2 cups of that.",
    "And then drop the meat",
    "back in     with all the aromatics,",
    "with all that big flavor,    and so now,",
    "back in, nestle all of     these inside.",
    "You gotta be conscious of this--if you're gonna go to the top,",
    "you only can go      about 3/4 of the way,",
    "and then I'm gonna throw    the bones right in there",
    "for good flavor on top of it.",
    "We will lock    the pressure cooker down.",
    "Okay, now here's        the key to this.",
    "Every pressure cooker's     different, get to know     your pressure cooker.",
    "Become friends with      your pressure cooker,",
    "because here's what happens--  we're gonna get this up",
    "to about 15psi,  and that's the perfect time--",
    "perfect pressure to cook it  with, and about medium heat,",
    "about 45 minutes, gonna be   super shred-apart tender.",
    "Come back, gonna do gnocchi,  I'll clean all this up.",
    "We're having the un-traditionaltraditional Thanksgiving",
    "at the Fieri house--      see you in a bit.",
    "♪♪",
    "♪♪",
    "Welcome back tothe un-traditional Thanksgiving.",
    "Ah, listen, this is where    it should be a tradition,",
    "because this dish is outrageous.",
    "So what I'm doing is I've takena little prosciutto,",
    "and I'm gonna crisp it up here,and this is one of",
    "my favorite Italian dishes.",
    "You take the prosciutto,    which everybody loves    prosciutto,",
    "but not a lot of people     have had it cooked.",
    "So you slice it thin and then cut some julienne strips of it",
    "and cook that down,    you get this really nice,",
    "salty, almost crunchy      like bacon.",
    "Get that in...",
    "Let me get...        the shallots in.",
    "[sizzling noises]",
    "There we go, and we'll just letthis mellow out for a second.",
    "What I have here    is the star of the show,",
    "and it's the lamb--     now the lamb's been in",
    "the pressure cooker     for, oh, I don't know,",
    "about 45 minutes--   big, beautiful leg of lamb.",
    "Had the local butcher take it,",
    "debone it for me.",
    "Now I've got it in the pressurecooker with a little molasses,",
    "some beef broth, we've got...",
    "a little balsamic--  actually, a lot of balsamic.",
    "Now you see what I just did   right there?",
    "I've been braising that.    First I seared it off,    a little salt, pepper,",
    "seared it off with a little  olive oil, I've got jalapenos",
    "and some onions      and some bell pepper,      some fennel.",
    "Oh, the fennel and the balsamicgo together great,but what I did is",
    "I just dropped it in here,and cooling down the temperature",
    "and releasing the steam,    I'm gonna be able    to open this up",
    "a lot quicker than I would  normally be able to if I just",
    "released the steam on the stove.",
    "You hear that?       Aw, it's fantastic.",
    "Best trick in the world,    'cause a lot of times,",
    "you're sittin' there, waitin'for it to just kinda decompress",
    "before you can get it to open, so let's see...",
    "let's see if we're       successful with it.",
    "Voila, so you took it    from super screamin' hot",
    "at 15 pounds per square inch,  the normal temp--",
    "the normal pressure   that you'd be cooking   in a pressure cooker with--",
    "and brought it down that quick by the ice bath.",
    "Okay.",
    "So here's that leg of lamb.",
    "And when I say",
    "fall-apart tender,    I can barely get it out.",
    "Have to bring this over here.",
    "Oh, just gorgeous.",
    "Now, I even took the bones,   the leg bone,",
    "and roasted it off.",
    "Oh! This is exactly    what we're talkin' about.",
    "All kinds of flavor built    into the bottom of this.",
    "Get the last little bits here,",
    "and all that marrow insidethe legs, you know that's where",
    "the flavor's comin' from, okay.",
    "Let me hold this off      to the side.",
    "There.",
    "Another pan,  gonna strain the liquid now.",
    "You really gotta remember    that little technique",
    "that I was just showing you   about throwing it   in the ice bath.",
    "I tell ya, I've watched so manypeople sit there, I was like,",
    "is the pressure cooker done?  Is it done? Is it done?",
    "That way right there,we did it in literally seconds.",
    "Okay.",
    "The last little bit of     the braising liquid.",
    "Perfect.",
    "♪♪",
    "And back onto the stove.    Okay.",
    "Now back to where we were.",
    "The shallots, cookin' down   with the prosciutto.",
    "If I threw the garlic in there when I put the shallots in,",
    "you're gonna have     that opportunity     for it to go and burn,",
    "so now that I'm back to paying attention to it...",
    "throw my garlic in.",
    "Touch more of the extra virgin olive oil.",
    "The flavor alone right here--let me throw some heat on that,",
    "reduce it just a bit more.",

    "Okay.",
    "There's also a touch      of nutmeg in there.",

    "that's the best.",
    "So we're talking about  making this, uh, this curry.",
    "And I've got some      peppers broken down.",
    "Aaron's working on         some shallots.",
    "We've got a whole list  of ingredients going in here.",
    "So just kind of follow with me         and keep track",
    "because I sometimes forget      a couple of the keys.",
    "The first order of business",
    "is to make the curry paste.",
    "So we start with Fresnos,       then some shallots,",
    "then some garlic,",
    "a little salt and pepper,    and a little lemongrass.",
    "Some coriander and cumin,        then some ginger,",
    "a little cilantro with the stem.",
    "Then a Sri Lanka lime leaf.",
    "If you don't have      this leaf, it's okay.",
    "It's not the end of the world,",
    "but it really does impart        a lot of flavor.",
    "And people used to call    these, uh, Kaffir limes.",
    "So we'll break that up in there.",
    "A little shrimp paste.",
    "If you don't havethe shrimp paste, Aaron,",
    "what would you like to use?If you didn't have shrimp paste?",
    "You know, an anchovy might be   a great replacement for that.",
    "You're really looking              for that seafood,",
    "that fishy flavor.",
    "But a lot of that umamiis coming through this.",
    "So when you're talkingabout making a really nice",
    "traditional curry,",
    "Thai curry, this is gonna be a good --",
    "this is gonna bea good start for you.",
    "Uh, but I agree.",
    "But you want that umami.You want that punch.",
    "That that seafood-y base.",
    "Pulse that in       the food processor,",
    "break it down,     still a little texture.",
    "Awesome.    Cook that off in the pan.",
    "Lots of flavor      coming through that.",
    "Pull it out. Now the pan is       nice and seasoned.",
    "Going with some thin strips       of some flank steak",
    "that were seasoned    with just a little salt.",
    "Spot on.",
    "Pan's hot, it's well-seasoned.Start dropping that in batches.",
    "Yes.",
    "A little bit of oil  in there for you.",
    "Yes. Yes, Chef.        Okay.",
    "Now let's talk about        this vinaigrette",
    "that we're gonna put  together for this awesome --",
    "and when I say awesome salad,      wait till you try it.",
    "Any time that I see  green papaya salad on a menu,",
    "I'll order it.",
    "And it's really because         there's some --",
    "Oh, my mouth      just starts to water",
    "as soon as I start        talking about it.",
    "It's got to be something       with the fish sauce",

    "The sweet, the tart,      the crunch, the acid.",
    "So the papaya vinaigrette,",
    "that's the first thing      we start it off with.",
    "A little lime zest.",
    "Let me get this one, as well.",
    "Now, first time    I had green papaya salad,",
    "I will tell you this,        I was a little --",
    "I was a little surprised.",
    "I mean, this was years ago,       maybe 15 years ago.",

    "\"What is this crunch?      Where is this noodle?",
    "I've never seen this.\"",
    "I think I might have had   a little bit too much beer.",
    "But it had such    phenomenal flavor to it.",
    "And I couldn't believe      what the texture was.",
    "And it's all from      this unripened fruit.",
    "Right behind you.",
    "There you go.",
    "Okay.         So lime juice.",
    "See how we didn't       put a bunch of meat",
    "in this pan and we just put     a little bit in there.",
    "What we're trying to do,  there's a lot of fat in that.",
    "A lot of moisture.     And I want to make sure",
    "that we don't sit there     and just boil the meat.",
    "That's why I also       took the paste out.",
    "So, Aaron, you want to move thataround a little bit for me?",
    "I want to build some crust on that.",
    "-Yep.      -Okay. So lime juice.",
    "Little olive oil,",
    "a little rice wine vinegar.",
    "So again, just kind of your --",
    "you know,     your Asian vinaigrette.",
    "Kind of simple.       This one is the --",
    "is the key,       is a little mirin.",
    "Lower in alcohol,        higher in sugar.",
    "Little fish sauce.",
    "Remember, always keep  the fish sauce in the fridge.",
    "You have a fish sauce you love the best?",
    "I don't to be quite --                    I --",
    "I mean, you're really        looking for that flavor,",
    "like you were talking about,                 that umami,",
    "that kind of earthiness,        that sixth flavor sense.",
    "I'll add a little bit of this  sesame oil and a little soy.",
    "And that should         round this out.",
    "The key though, to me,         with fish sauce",
    "is you got to watch out because    they're not all the same.",
    "And some are pretty gnarly   and they get pretty strong",
    "and they can sabotage your dish.",
    "Okay, some sugar.",
    "Vinaigrette's done,      working on the meat.",
    "The red chili       Thai paste is done.",
    "We got to prep some veggies, we're putting salads together.",

    "and making everything         under the sun.",
    "And that's what happens       here at the ranch.",
    "So we made our own      Thai paste over here",
    "with some Fresno chilies       and some lemongrass",
    "and some ginger     and some garlic and --",
    "Well, you name it,    everybody's in the pool.",
    "Seared that off, now I'm   getting the pan super hot.",

    "We cut the flank     steak down, Aaron did.",
    "We salted a little bit and then  put a really nice sear on it.",
    "See that little crust     that we tried to build?",
    "Had all the flavor      leftover in the pan.",
    "Now we'll drop the, uh,     peppers and onions in.",
    "I didn't want to drop        the, uh, peppers",

    "because of the consumption               level in Asia.",
    "Where did you get  this information?",
    "I mean,       it came to me in a dream.",
    "I don't know if he's --I mean, he knows everything.",
    "-I'm telling the truth.             -Okay.",
    "-I'm telling the truth.    -All right. I don't know.",
    "That sounded way  too easy for you.",
    "We're gonna grab this green papaya.",
    "Now, when I go to, uh,",
    "some of my favorite Asian restaurants,",
    "I'll see them takethis papaya, trim it down,",
    "just taking a little bit  of the skin off.",
    "Okay.Now this one is just getting",
    "on the verge of not working.",
    "Because you can see how theflesh is turning a little bit,",
    "uh, how it's turninga little beige, a little orange.",
    "You'd like it to be  really nice and crisp white.",
    "But I can feel how --   I can feel how firm it is.",
    "So it'll probably work.",
    "Now, this is       how I see 'em do it",
    "at my favorite market.       They go like this.",
    "And you'll see the lady     sitting right there --",
    "or the guy, whomever --       sitting right there",
    "and then just kind of hitting it",
    "and just lightly        tapping it, okay?",
    "Now, they'll take it      right to themselves.",
    "I'll just do this      to kind of show you.",
    "They'll just take it and carve     it right to themselves,",
    "just carve this off.",
    "And what we get are these really nice fantastic strands.",
    "Okay?     That takes a long time.",
    "So the way we're gonna do it",
    "is we're gonna bring out",
    "this cool little slicer      that we found online.",
    "Kind of like a mandoline     with some teeth in it.",

    "green papaya.              Huh?",
    "Okay.    So we got papayas to do,",
    "green beans are scorching,    cooking that sauce down.",
    "Give it a little taste,      make sure we're good.",
    "The beef is finished.          Come on back,",
    "hanging out with Chef Aaron May.",

    "We're making fantastic           Thai food.",

    "and make things that you     typically wouldn't make",
    "when you're cooking     in an outdoor kitchen.",
    "So we're making           Thai food.",
    "We made some red        Thai curry paste.",
    "Um, with some --      with some lemongrass",
    "and all kinds of great stuff      and ginger and garlic",

    "on top of it   for a little funky crunch.",
    "And I also need to get        the rice started.",
    "And I'm gonna do a rice     with some coconut milk.",
    "So, um, to go along with this.",
    "A little jasmine rice there.",
    "Keep an eye on that,  would you, Chef?",
    "Yeah, Chef.",
    "The key here is to use a really good long-grain rice.",
    "It's a supporting player,  but it has to be done right.",
    "Three cups of the jasmine rice.",
    "I'm gonna rinse it real quick.",
    "Drop that down.",
    "The rice,     pretty straightforward.",
    "A little coconut milk         and some water.",
    "Just about 2 cups        of coconut milk.",
    "Three and a quarter         cups of water.",
    "Start to simmer that.              Okay.",
    "Everybody's dropped     in the pool over there.",
    "Okay, where are we at?I'm gonna start giving --",
    "Bell pepper and cucumber.",
    "-Let me give you some tomatoes.            -Perfect.",
    "Start giving mea little chop on that.",
    "I also got to toast up          some pepitas.",
    "And I got to add          a little bit",
    "of chicken stock     over here in my curry.",
    "So I didn't talk        about the curry.",
    "So we made this awesome   curry with the lemongrass.",
    "And we had the Fresno chilies,    a lot of Fresno chilies,",
    "and some garlic.       Made our own paste.",
    "And the great thing  is that I didn't use it all.",
    "So I have some in reserve",
    "if I don't want to make it     too spicy or if the --",
    "if the paste itself        is really strong.",
    "Add a little bit    of chicken stock to that.",
    "Gonna thin it out a bit.  And I took this flank steak,",
    "or Aaron took the flank   steak a the very beginning.",
    "There we go.   Just to thin it out a bit.",
    "Took the flank steak      at the very beginning",
    "and, uh, seared it off.",
    "So it's got some       nice texture to it.",
    "And then we're just slowly",
    "letting this sauce         come together.",
    "Really building flavors   with the green bell pepper",
    "and the red bell pepper inside.              Okay.",
    "And then also hit    some coconut milk in it.",
    "Let me give this         a little taste.",
    "Oh, brother.     That's coming together.",
    "That is coming       together big time.",
    "I'm not gonna       feed you the taste.",
    "You can get after it yourself.   You tell me if that has --",
    "doesn't have some real      depth of Thai flavor.",
    "-Wow.              -Huh?",
    "I mean,   as good as anything anywhere.",
    "As good as anything      anywhere.",

    "Wow, that's a lot a bit hot.",
    "Um, but this is         gonna be great.",
    "Nice little crunchy    texture into this salad.",
    "We toasted some       of the jasmine rice",

    "with somebody like that,   that has such an open mind",
    "and an open palette,          it's just --",
    "that's the best.",
    "So we're talking about  making this, uh, this curry.",
    "And I've got some      peppers broken down.",
    "Aaron's working on         some shallots.",
    "We've got a whole list  of ingredients going in here.",
    "So just kind of follow with me         and keep track",
    "because I sometimes forget      a couple of the keys.",
    "The first order of business",
    "is to make the curry paste.",
    "So we start with Fresnos,       then some shallots,",
    "then some garlic,",
    "a little salt and pepper,    and a little lemongrass.",
    "Some coriander and cumin,        then some ginger,",
    "a little cilantro with the stem.",
    "Then a Sri Lanka lime leaf.",
    "If you don't have      this leaf, it's okay.",
    "It's not the end of the world,",
    "but it really does impart        a lot of flavor.",
    "And people used to call    these, uh, Kaffir limes.",
    "So we'll break that up in there.",
    "A little shrimp paste.",
    "If you don't havethe shrimp paste, Aaron,",
    "what would you like to use?If you didn't have shrimp paste?",
    "You know, an anchovy might be   a great replacement for that.",
    "You're really looking              for that seafood,",
    "that fishy flavor.",
    "But a lot of that umamiis coming through this.",
    "So when you're talkingabout making a really nice",
    "traditional curry,",
    "Thai curry, this is gonna be a good --",
    "this is gonna bea good start for you.",
    "Uh, but I agree.",
    "But you want that umami.You want that punch.",
    "That that seafood-y base.",
    "Pulse that in       the food processor,",
    "break it down,     still a little texture.",
    "Awesome.    Cook that off in the pan.",
    "Lots of flavor      coming through that.",
    "Pull it out. Now the pan is       nice and seasoned.",
    "Going with some thin strips       of some flank steak",
    "that were seasoned    with just a little salt.",
    "Spot on.",
    "Pan's hot, it's well-seasoned.Start dropping that in batches.",
    "Yes.",
    "A little bit of oil  in there for you.",
    "Yes. Yes, Chef.        Okay.",
    "Now let's talk about        this vinaigrette",
    "that we're gonna put  together for this awesome --",
    "and when I say awesome salad,      wait till you try it.",
    "Any time that I see  green papaya salad on a menu,",
    "I'll order it.",
    "And it's really because         there's some --",
    "Oh, my mouth      just starts to water",
    "as soon as I start        talking about it.",
    "It's got to be something       with the fish sauce",
    "and the crunchy flesh of the green papaya, the fruit.",
    "The sweet, the tart,      the crunch, the acid.",
    "So the papaya vinaigrette,",
    "that's the first thing      we start it off with.",
    "A little lime zest.",
    "Let me get this one, as well.",
    "Now, first time    I had green papaya salad,",
    "I will tell you this,        I was a little --",
    "I was a little surprised.",
    "I mean, this was years ago,       maybe 15 years ago.",
    "But I'm sitting there     eating it and I'm like,",
    "\"What is this crunch?      Where is this noodle?",
    "I've never seen this.\"",
    "I think I might have had   a little bit too much beer.",
    "But it had such    phenomenal flavor to it.",
    "And I couldn't believe      what the texture was.",
    "And it's all from      this unripened fruit.",
    "Right behind you.",
    "There you go.",
    "Okay.         So lime juice.",
    "See how we didn't       put a bunch of meat",
    "in this pan and we just put     a little bit in there.",
    "What we're trying to do,  there's a lot of fat in that.",
    "A lot of moisture.     And I want to make sure",
    "that we don't sit there     and just boil the meat.",
    "That's why I also       took the paste out.",
    "So, Aaron, you want to move thataround a little bit for me?",
    "I want to build some crust on that.",
    "-Yep.      -Okay. So lime juice.",
    "Little olive oil,",
    "a little rice wine vinegar.",
    "So again, just kind of your --",
    "you know,     your Asian vinaigrette.",
    "Kind of simple.       This one is the --",
    "is the key,       is a little mirin.",
    "Lower in alcohol,        higher in sugar.",
    "Little fish sauce.",
    "Remember, always keep  the fish sauce in the fridge.",
    "You have a fish sauce you love the best?",
    "I don't to be quite --                    I --",
    "I mean, you're really        looking for that flavor,",
    "like you were talking about,                 that umami,",
    "that kind of earthiness,        that sixth flavor sense.",
    "I'll add a little bit of this  sesame oil and a little soy.",
    "And that should         round this out.",
    "The key though, to me,         with fish sauce",
    "is you got to watch out because    they're not all the same.",
    "And some are pretty gnarly   and they get pretty strong",
    "and they can sabotage your dish.",
    "Okay, some sugar.",

    "By taking these veggies,     we're still gonna leave",
    "the green beans crispy,",
    "but they're gonna      have that nice char.",
    "They're gonna bring in that      cooked element to it",
    "without having       the cooked texture.",
    "You know what I'm saying?",
    "That depth of flavor         you get from that char,",
    "that bitterness,               as a contrast,",
    "is one of my              favorite things.",
    "So just think        of all the flavor",
    "that we've already       started to develop.",
    "We got all the fat coming off        that flank steak.",
    "We had some of the paste     that was left in there.",
    "We'll add some more       paste in right now.",
    "And this where I kind of get --",
    "this is where     I kind of take it easy.",
    "I want to just see       how this develops.",
    "Remember, you're working       with fresh veggies.",
    "So if it gets --   you get too much in there,",
    "you know, each one is gonna be     a little bit different.",
    "You got to taste it yourself.",
    "So we'll stir this in     and see where we're at.",

    "Ready to go.",
    "You work with purpose,     my friend.",

    "All right.     Now, Aaron,",
    "pan is hot and I gave ita little bit of oil.",
    "If you just want to   babysit those.",
    "This is cooking down,blistering the beans.",
    "Everything looks great.",
    "Okay, green papaya,what do you know about it?",
    "I know it's one of the mostwidely eaten fruits in the world",
    "because of the consumption               level in Asia.",
    "Where did you get  this information?",

    "-I'm telling the truth.             -Okay.",
    "-I'm telling the truth.    -All right. I don't know.",
    "That sounded way  too easy for you.",
    "We're gonna grab this green papaya.",
    "Now, when I go to, uh,",
    "some of my favorite Asian restaurants,",
    "I'll see them takethis papaya, trim it down,",
    "just taking a little bit  of the skin off.",
    "Okay.Now this one is just getting",
    "on the verge of not working.",
    "Because you can see how theflesh is turning a little bit,",
    "uh, how it's turninga little beige, a little orange.",
    "You'd like it to be  really nice and crisp white.",
    "But I can feel how --   I can feel how firm it is.",
    "So it'll probably work.",
    "Now, this is       how I see 'em do it",
    "at my favorite market.       They go like this.",
    "And you'll see the lady     sitting right there --",
    "or the guy, whomever --       sitting right there",
    "and then just kind of hitting it",
    "and just lightly        tapping it, okay?",
    "Now, they'll take it      right to themselves.",
    "I'll just do this      to kind of show you.",
    "They'll just take it and carve     it right to themselves,",
    "just carve this off.",
    "And what we get are these really nice fantastic strands.",
    "Okay?     That takes a long time.",
    "So the way we're gonna do it",
    "is we're gonna bring out",
    "this cool little slicer      that we found online.",
    "Kind of like a mandoline     with some teeth in it.",

    "on top of it   for a little funky crunch.",
    "And I also need to get        the rice started.",
    "And I'm gonna do a rice     with some coconut milk.",
    "So, um, to go along with this.",
    "A little jasmine rice there.",
    "Keep an eye on that,  would you, Chef?",
    "Yeah, Chef.",
    "The key here is to use a really good long-grain rice.",
    "It's a supporting player,  but it has to be done right.",
    "Three cups of the jasmine rice.",
    "I'm gonna rinse it real quick.",
    "Drop that down.",

    "of chicken stock     over here in my curry.",
    "So I didn't talk        about the curry.",
    "So we made this awesome   curry with the lemongrass.",
    "And we had the Fresno chilies,    a lot of Fresno chilies,",
    "and some garlic.       Made our own paste.",
    "And the great thing  is that I didn't use it all.",
    "So I have some in reserve",
    "if I don't want to make it     too spicy or if the --",
    "if the paste itself        is really strong.",
    "Add a little bit    of chicken stock to that.",
    "Gonna thin it out a bit.  And I took this flank steak,",
    "or Aaron took the flank   steak a the very beginning.",
    "There we go.   Just to thin it out a bit.",
    "Took the flank steak      at the very beginning",
    "and, uh, seared it off.",

    "And then we're just slowly",
    "letting this sauce         come together.",
    "Really building flavors   with the green bell pepper",

    "I'm not gonna       feed you the taste.",
    "You can get after it yourself.   You tell me if that has --",

    "Sounds very, uh,      sounds Russian to me.",
    "For some reason,I always thought it was Russian.",
    "I think the French stole it.",
    "And then the Russians               took it back.",
    "Is that what it is? Well, we tried it",
    "at a Soviet restaurant in Cuba.",
    "And I'm not kiddin' you.      This place was legit.",
    "And I've never seen       Kiev done this way.",
    "I always thought it wasthe chicken breast stuffed...",
    "-Pounded.   -Pounded out a little bit,",
    "then breaded, then fried.",
    "Well, this right here,",
    "we're gonna be grinding   our own chicken.",
    "We're in for a blast.      Trust me.",
    "Um, you're good with that.",
    "Can I get abouta quarter cup of, uh,",
    "the Pepper Jack cheese?",
    "Okay, so we'll start withsome butter, a lotta butter.",
    "We're gonna take this butter,mix it with these ingredients.",
    "We got dill.Yeah. Right in there.",
    "Throw a little bitof smashed garlic.",
    "There we go.So the Pepper Jack cheese,",
    "the butter,little bit of garlic.",
    "That's a lotta garlic.",
    "That's not a lotta garlic.  It's just a little bit.",
    "Who ever comments abouttoo much garlic in their --",
    "-Yes, it is.              -Huh?",
    "Who doesn't like garlic?You didn't just say that.",
    "All right.Little cream cheese.",
    "But you listen.So we go to Cuba.",
    "And it was reallyjust at the beginning",
    "when people were havingthe opportunity to go to Cuba.",
    "Lori and my momand dad flew in ahead of me.",
    "I was coming in from Texas.    And they get there.",
    "They had a real tough time,well, not a real tough time.",
    "But they had an interesting time     coming through customs.",
    "Me, I just breezed  right through.",
    "But, boy, was it a blast       or what?                       Oh, yeah.",
    "But your father, I thought    they were gonna lock him up.",
    "Well, they probablyshould lock him up.",
    "Anyways, uh,so some cream cheese.",
    "-Don't help.           -Oh, okay.",
    "Just stand overthere and watch me.",
    "-Want a back scratch?       -No. Mom, come on.",
    "Would you chop upa little bit of parsley?",
    "I gotta kinda pulse thisa little bit, get this started.",
    "Okay. So this isgonna be the stuffing.",
    "Now, believe it or not,we're gonna take this stuffing",
    "and freeze it beforewe put it into the, uh,",
    "before we put itinto the chicken.",
    "This always happens whenI put cream cheese in there.",
    "Okay. So wad that down in.",
    "So yeah.We go -- we get there.",
    "We were there for about 5 days.        We did it all.",
    "We toured allthroughout Havana.",
    "Then, we wentoutside of Havana,",
    "went to a Cuban cigar factory.",
    "That was outrageous.",
    "Just really nice people,    really cool cars.",
    "I didn't believe that the car  thing was true, did you?",
    "No.That they were actually gonna be   drivin' those cars around?",
    "And if you saw a car that wasn't  an old car, you stared at it.",
    "But the old cars                were everywhere.",
    "So after a while,             it was no big deal.",
    "Yeah. It wasn't.Go ahead and drop it in, Mom.",
    "Okay. Little smoked paprika.",
    "There we go.",
    "Little salt and pepper.",
    "And I'm just fighting toget this to start to work.",
    "If you can let the cream cheese  sit out a bit or the butter,",
    "go ahead and, uh, and do it.",
    "It won't make it so tough     to get this to mix up.",
    "All right.Give it one more try.",
    "-I've done this before.            -I know.",
    "I know it's not appearing --",
    "Nothing worse than have your mom  watching over your shoulder.",
    "\"Uh, real good.Great job on the show, Guy.\"",
    "Okay. Here we go.",
    "The compound butter --",
    "Well, we should call it      compound butter plus.",
    "Had the butter.        Had cream cheese.",
    "It had, uh, uh,     the Pepper Jack cheese,",
    "little smoked paprika,        had some garlic,",
    "little parsley,    a little salt and pepper.",
    "And to round it out, which this place was known for,",
    "Okay. So what we'll do,",
    "take a little bitof this compound butter.",
    "Lay it right here in the center.",
    "We're gonna freeze this, Mom.",
    "We're gonna freeze it  real tight. Okay?",
    "We're gonna freeze it so, when we drop it inside,",
    "we're gonna get some groundchicken here in just a second.",
    "But we'll freeze this so tight that, when we drop it in there,",
    "it's almost gonna be likea butter-cream cheese Popsicle.",
    "Okay?",
    "Lay that down.",
    "Want me to wrap that? No. I got it.",
    "Why? Just 'cause I couldn't     use my own mixer,",
    "you think that, now, that'sthe way everything's gonna be?",
    "Roll that over.",
    "Here we go.Give it a little spin.",
    "There we go. Okay.",
    "And the key to this is, drop -- gotta drop it in the freezer.",
    "Okay?",
    "Right down here in the freezer.    Out comes the chicken.",
    "So what I did here, Mom,you got breasts and thighs.",
    "Cubed them up,threw 'em in the freezer",
    "and just put a little bit   of a freeze on 'em.",
    "You know like when you're trying to slice something really thin?",
    "-If it's a tiny bit frozen...             -Right.",
    "...it just worksa little bit easier.",
    "Would you grab me that other     carafe right there",
    "for the food processor?",
    "Right there.",
    "So you could get ground chicken.",
    "But if by chance you can't,",
    "and you wanna make this dish,  this is the way to do it.",
    "You put a little bit extra --",
    "you put a little bit extra time into it.",
    "Cut it up.Freeze it a little bit.",
    "And we'll be ableto process it through here.",
    "So --               Is this better             than buying ground?",
    "Well, here's the thingyou know is you know exactly",
    "what your ratio's gonna be.                         Uh-huh.",
    "So here we've got equal parts     of breast and thigh",
    "or maybe two-thirds,     one-third.",
    "Don't overload it. Pop it like that.",
    "Sometimes, it'sa little too frozen.",
    "So if you haveto let it sit out",
    "in a little room temperature,    just kinda pulse it.",
    "[ Whirs ]",
    "Let's take a look at that.",

    "You know, how muchfat you have in there,",
    "how much breast, how much thigh.",
    "Yeah. It looks good.Fantastic. Okay.",
    "So we take that out.  We knock it over.",
    "And we continue the process.",
    "You ready?                          Yep.",

    "-Oh, wow.  -Oh, yeah. It's frozen hard.",
    "And the reason it is, Mom,",
    "you'll see this here                in a second,",

    "I found this method. I do this a lot when I'm doing burgers.",
    "Okay. So then I got four     equal portions.                        Okay.",
    "Okay?                       Yep.",
    "So now, pick it up   with my hand.",
    "Gonna kinda compact ittogether a little bit.",

    "And I've also gotsome more frozen chicken.",

    "is just to make surethat it's evenly coated.",
    "Okay? So we got --",
    "-Like pigs in a blanket.         -It's -- yeah.",
    "Just weird --just with raw --",
    "You wanna stir that for me?           Okay.",
    "Okay. Now, the wet chicken     is gonna pick up",
    "a little bit ofthe seasoned flour.",
    "Uh-huh.",
    "Actually, that's probably    gone enough, Mom.",
    "You can justpull it off the heat.",
    "So a little bit ofthe seasoned flour sticks",
    "to the wet chicken.",
    "You're doing the rest of these.You better be paying attention.",

    "Then we go into the egg wash,",
    "egg wash intothe Italian bread crumb.",

    "that we're putting together.",
    "So we'll go from the Italian bread crumb back into this,",
    "back into the egg wash again.",
    "Why do you do two bread crumbs?So it really creates",
    "a coating on itso when it starts to cook --",
    "'Cause we're gonna pan-fry it,  then finish it in the oven.",
    "And this will keep it from --",
    "this will reallycreate a barrier",
    "so the cheese doesn't explode.",
    "But why two kinds               of bread crumbs?",

    "took this compound butter",

    "there's a lotta theories           about this.",
    "One -- The real, true theory is it didn't come from Moscow.",
    "Two -- Moscow Mules               have that kick.",
    "They say the kick comes         from that ginger beer.",
    "So what I'm gonna do is drop in some beautiful blackberries.",
    "These are too big.They didn't come from our ranch.",
    "Our berry bushes are tiny.",
    "And the deer eat 'em                all the time.",
    "So these we got                from the market.",
    "Um, we'll get, uh...",
    "That has garlic on it.",

    "There we go.",
    "So the Moscow Mule,             they say that it --",
    "they call it the Mule because  it's got the ginger beer kick.",
    "So you're talkin' about          vodka and ginger beer",
    "and a little bit of lime.",
    "So what we're doin' here  is adding in the blackberries.",
    "Still got the lime.",

    "Is that what it is? Well, we tried it",
    "at a Soviet restaurant in Cuba.",

    "And it was reallyjust at the beginning",
    "when people were havingthe opportunity to go to Cuba.",
    "Lori and my momand dad flew in ahead of me.",
    "I was coming in from Texas.    And they get there.",
    "They had a real tough time,well, not a real tough time.",

    "I gotta kinda pulse thisa little bit, get this started.",
    "Okay. So this isgonna be the stuffing.",
    "Now, believe it or not,we're gonna take this stuffing",
    "and freeze it beforewe put it into the, uh,",
    "before we put itinto the chicken.",
    "This always happens whenI put cream cheese in there.",
    "Okay. So wad that down in.",
    "So yeah.We go -- we get there.",
    "We were there for about 5 days.        We did it all.",
    "We toured allthroughout Havana.",

    "little smoked paprika,        had some garlic,",
    "little parsley,    a little salt and pepper.",
    "And to round it out, which this place was known for,",
    "Okay. So what we'll do,",
    "take a little bitof this compound butter.",
    "Lay it right here in the center.",
    "We're gonna freeze this, Mom.",
    "We're gonna freeze it  real tight. Okay?",
    "We're gonna freeze it so, when we drop it inside,",

    "it's almost gonna be likea butter-cream cheese Popsicle.",
    "Okay?",
    "Lay that down.",
    "Want me to wrap that? No. I got it.",

    "So what I did here, Mom,you got breasts and thighs.",
    "Cubed them up,threw 'em in the freezer",
    "and just put a little bit   of a freeze on 'em.",
    "You know like when you're trying to slice something really thin?",
    "-If it's a tiny bit frozen...             -Right.",
    "...it just worksa little bit easier.",
    "Would you grab me that other     carafe right there",
    "for the food processor?",
    "Right there.",
    "So you could get ground chicken.",
    "But if by chance you can't,",
    "and you wanna make this dish,  this is the way to do it.",
    "You put a little bit extra --",
    "you put a little bit extra time into it.",
    "Cut it up.Freeze it a little bit.",
    "And we'll be ableto process it through here.",
    "So --               Is this better             than buying ground?",
    "Well, here's the thingyou know is you know exactly",
    "what your ratio's gonna be.                         Uh-huh.",

    "or maybe two-thirds,     one-third.",
    "Don't overload it. Pop it like that.",
    "Sometimes, it'sa little too frozen.",
    "So if you haveto let it sit out",
    "in a little room temperature,    just kinda pulse it.",
    "Let's take a look at that.",
    "So you see what you get?                         Uh-huh.",
    "Nice little --nice, ground up.",
    "You know, how muchfat you have in there,",
    "how much breast, how much thigh.",

    "We did the ground              chicken ourselves.",
    "We have our whisk. Okay.",
    "We did the, uh, we did the, uh,    ground chicken ourselves.",
    "You can't always find    ground chicken in the store.",
    "But if you get           equal parts of breast",
    "and thigh or your mixture            that you like,",
    "and you take that,        I'll tell you something.",
    "Just freeze it up                 a little bit.",
    "Throw it into               a food processor.",
    "And you're good to go.",
    "Hi, Roxy.Wanna help?",
    "All right.             So a little fennel,",
    "a little zucchini.                  Okay, Mom.",
    "Let me ask you a question         while I'm doing this,",
    "while I'm -- while          I'm daring my fingers.Okay.",
    "Uh, favorite thing             about Cuba, what --",
    "besides the fact                that I took you?",
    "Oh. Oh, I'd say it's the night that you went to bed at 9:00,",
    "and I went out till 3:00.",
    "I can't believe you just          told everybody that.",
    "That is so ridiculous.    I did not go to bed at 9:00.",
    "It was 9:30.I went to Cuba for the music.",
    "It was -- it was 9:30, Mom.",
    "So, yeah. So I, you know,         listen, I'm working.",
    "I got things going on.       We're over there shooting",
    "a, uh, a special                 for \"Triple D\"",
    "and for, uh,             the Travel Channel.",
    "So I'm doing            my responsible part.",
    "She's goin' out.",
    "They don't start the music        in Cuba till what time?",
    "It started at midnight,",
    "but it was really 1:00because the time changed.",
    "You all set up? Okay.I'm all ready.",
    "Little salt on this is gonna bring out some of the moisture.",
    "We're gonna be making a salad    outta this in a little bit.",
    "I'll set this aside.",
    "Let me get a pan hot here.",
    "I've got a little prosciutto   that I'm just gonna crisp up.",
    "This is gonna be kinda the, uh,",
    "the garnish or the little bit         of the crouton",
    "for this fantastic salad",
    "with the fennel        and the zucchini.",
    "Mom, you ready     to do this over there?",
    "Let me just fold this over.",
    "I love prosciutto        when it's crispy.",
    "There's just a salty       nuttiness about it.",
    "And it's always worth it, getting really good prosciutto.",
    "Okay. We'll drop this --   Actually, Mom, do me a favor.",
    "-Uh-huh? -Little olive oil right there,",
    "the first one in front of you,           that bottle,",
    "just so it         doesn't stick too much.",
    "How do you know if it'sreally good prosciutto?                   There you go.",
    "All right. I'm sorry?",
    "How do you know if it'sreally good prosciutto?",
    "The price or...   Well, sadly enough, by price.",
    "But really, uh,             you're looking for,",
    "uh, imported          prosciutto from Italy.",
    "You're also looking at the,      uh, how long it was aged.",
    "They age prosciutto.                    Okay.",
    "Let this go.            Let's get into this.",
    "This is where things      are gonna get dicey.",
    "Uh, outta the freezer,",
    "pulling out",
    "our log of butter.",
    "Now this is the one          that we took and mixed",
    "with the cream cheese,",
    "the butter, the dill.",
    "The dill is what really   makes the dish come together.",
    "-Did it freeze?             -Yeah.",
    "-Oh, wow.  -Oh, yeah. It's frozen hard.",
    "And the reason it is, Mom,",
    "you'll see this here                in a second,",
    "is I want it frozen so       when we start to cook it,",
    "it doesn't start to leak out",
    "all this great flavor            right off the bat.",
    "-Right.             -Okay?",
    "About that size.",
    "And you're gonna have      to follow along here",
    "'cause this gets real --             -Okay.",
    "Real quick real fast.        Okay?",
    "So ground chicken,thighs and breast,",
    "cut it in half.",
    "Just so I don't usetoo much of one...                          Right.",
    "I found this method. I do this a lot when I'm doing burgers.",
    "Okay. So then I got four     equal portions.                        Okay.",
    "Okay?                       Yep.",
    "So now, pick it up   with my hand.",
    "Gonna kinda compact ittogether a little bit.",
    "Make a little bit   of a canoe.",
    "-Okay? Nice and firm.             -Okay.",
    "Drop that inside.",
    "Okay? Wrap it around.",
    "I'm gonna steala little bit of this.",
    "You're gonna end up                 with three.",
    "Well, it might be three.       But listen.",
    "As big and as bodaciousand delicious as these are --",
    "And I've also gotsome more frozen chicken.",
    "So I can knock that out.      But the idea",
    "is just to make surethat it's evenly coated.",
    "Okay? So we got --",
    "-Like pigs in a blanket.         -It's -- yeah.",
    "Just weird --just with raw --",
    "You wanna stir that for me?           Okay.",
    "Okay. Now, the wet chicken     is gonna pick up",
    "a little bit ofthe seasoned flour.",
    "Uh-huh.",
    "Actually, that's probably    gone enough, Mom.",
    "You can justpull it off the heat.",
    "So a little bit ofthe seasoned flour sticks",
    "to the wet chicken.",
    "You're doing the rest of these.You better be paying attention.",
    "I am.    Okay?",
    "Then we go into the egg wash,",
    "egg wash intothe Italian bread crumb.",
    "And this isa really thick batter",
    "that we're putting together.",
    "So we'll go from the Italian bread crumb back into this,",
    "back into the egg wash again.",
    "Why do you do two bread crumbs?So it really creates",
    "a coating on itso when it starts to cook --",
    "'Cause we're gonna pan-fry it,  then finish it in the oven.",
    "And this will keep it from --",
    "this will reallycreate a barrier",
    "so the cheese doesn't explode.",
    "But why two kinds               of bread crumbs?",
    "Those are a little bit       thinner.",
    "These are a little  bit crunchier.",
    "We're explaining it all. See?   We're learning at home.",
    "We're spreadingattention together.",
    "See you in a little bit.",
    "She's gonna get started  on these right now.",
    "I've done one. And I'm done.",
    "Go ahead, Mom.Jump in. Grab it.",
    "Welcome back. Special day.     My mom's on \"Big Bite.\"",
    "So you know that, uh,   not a lot is getting done.",
    "And there's more laughing --              Oh, hey.",
    "How'd I do?",
    "Uh, you did --  I'm actually really impressed.",
    "How was your e-mails?           My e-mails were good.",
    "While I was doin' all the work.                      Thank you.",
    "I have important things            I'm dealing with.",
    "I don't know what those         important things were.",
    "Okay. Fantastic.             So what we did here",
    "is we made this       ground chicken ourselves.",
    "And my mom, very diligently,           by the way, uh,",
    "took this compound butter",
    "that's got a little,              uh, cream cheese",
    "and Pepper Jack               and, uh, paprika,",
    "mixed it all together,           put it inside frozen,",
    "wrapped the chicken around        it and then dredged it.",
    "And we're talkin'             heavy dredge, okay?",
    "-We're talkin', uh, flour.             -Flour.",
    "Then went to the egg,",
    "then went to        the Italian bread crumb,",
    "then went back to the egg,        then went to the panko.",
    "So oil is right                 about 350, Mom.",
    "-Okay.           -Go ahead.",
    "Here's a spoon.          Lay that on the spoon.",
    "And just gently                 drop those in.",
    "-Okay.     -And you're good to go.",
    "On the -- While she's             workin' on that,",
    "I've got some, uh, zucchini           and some fennel",
    "that I, uh,             salted in the back.",
    "I'm gonna rinse that off            in a bit to make",
    "this really nice salad  that's gonna go along with it.",
    "You see, when you               put it in there,",
    "how it just comes up               about halfway?Yeah. Yeah.",
    "We'll fry both of these.              There you go.",
    "Don't put it too close to it.Okay.",
    "Okay? The idea is not        to really mess with them",
    "because you're starting        to set up the crust now.",
    "It's kind of in           a very tender moment.",
    "Um, once it starts             to build its crust,",
    "tse in the oven.              It's kind of in           a very tender moment.",
    "Okay.            Um, you can go ahead",
    "and pluck some of those             fronds for me.",
    "-Okay.-I just need some of the fronds.",
    "This is gonna go for     the dressing for the salad.",
    "Typically, the Kiev     is served with noodles.",
    "So this is my California version   of serving it with noodles.",
    "You know,     when you take zucchini,",
    "and you slice it thin        on the mandoline,",
    "add a little fennel to it,     made a little dressing,",
    "olive oil,     some garlic, some salt,",
    "some pepper      and the fennel fronds",
    "and a little bit of lemon zest        and lemon juice.",
    "Took some prosciutto,         sliced it thin,",
    "threw it in a pan      and crisped that up.",
    "Combine it all together       and then top it off",
    "with a little shaved pecorino,         nice and salty.",
    "Ah, a raw salad like this  with such flavor and texture,",
    "perfect for the Kiev.",
    "Okay. Dressing's done.               There we go.",
    "Now, want a cocktail,                  Mother?",
    "I know I don't need              to ask you that.",
    "-Of course.             -Okay.",
    "-Of course --      -Let's talk about --",
    "Have you ever had a Moscow Mule?Yep.",
    "Okay. So this isn't the idea         of the Moscow Mule.",
    "But we're gonna use,     in this Moscow Mule --",
    "Let me grab this here.",
    "-Grab all my goodies.        -Lazy man's load.",
    "-You need some help?              -No.",
    "This is not              a lazy man's load.",
    "- Except I forgot one thing.  -Good.",
    "All right.       So the Moscow Mule,",
    "there's a lotta theories           about this.",
    "One -- The real, true theory is it didn't come from Moscow.",
    "Two -- Moscow Mules               have that kick.",
    "They say the kick comes         from that ginger beer.",
    "So what I'm gonna do is drop in some beautiful blackberries.",
    "These are too big.They didn't come from our ranch.",
    "Our berry bushes are tiny.",
    "And the deer eat 'em                all the time.",
    "So these we got                from the market.",
    "Um, we'll get, uh...",
    "That has garlic on it.",
    "-That'll taste good.  -Little garlic and some lime.",
    "That's how they got the coffee   in the -- in the lobster.",
    "Yeah, it was,          the coffee in lobster.",
    "So we go to this place             called El Figaro.",
    "And, uh, it's in a place       called Barbershops Alley.",
    "-And they made a lobster...             -Yeah.",
    "...that was done with         with an espresso sauce,",
    "outrageous.Am I gonna put these on here?",
    "Yeah. Go ahead and swap             those out, Mom.",
    "Perfect. All right.",
    "So let me get in here             and muddle this,",
    "few ice cubes             just to help build.",
    "There we go.",
    "So the Moscow Mule,             they say that it --",
    "they call it the Mule because  it's got the ginger beer kick.",
    "So you're talkin' about          vodka and ginger beer",
    "and a little bit of lime.",
    "So what we're doin' here  is adding in the blackberries.",
    "Still got the lime.",
    "And we are gonna hit it      with a little ginger beer.",
    "But look at that,       nice little muddle there.",
    "-You work quick.              -Oh.",
    "I gotta stay on --        I gotta stay on my toes.",
    "-Keep goin'.        -Oh. So these...",
    "You got it. Yeah.",
    "-All right.             -Okay.",
    "The drinks in Cuba,           that was interesting.",
    "I went and made the,           uh, had the daiquiris",
    "at, uh, Hemingway's              place where he --",
    "where his -- his, uh, haunt.",
    "Did you guys               make it by there?",
    "We went to one bar he went,     but not that one.",
    "Well, you could've gone          to any bar in Havana.",
    "I think he might've gone to.That's true.",
    "Okay. Little bit --",
    "The one we went to,the only picture I saw of Castro",
    "in the whole place in Havana,       the whole city,",
    "was with, uh, Hemingwayand Castro in this bar.",
    "-And, uh...            -Really?",
    "Yeah. It was a great place.",
    "We went to the place       that makes the daiquiris.",
    "And I'm telling you,  the daiquiris were outrageous.",
    "I mean, I didn't think,                you know,",
    "what could be so special            about the daiq--",
    "- Whoa.    -Huh?",
    "See? I caught it.                  Okay, Mom.",
    "Right in the fridge right there, if you wouldn't mind grabbing,",
    "top drawer, should be          a couple ginger beers.",
    "Okay.",
    "So pour that             right over the top.",
    "Get some of the muddled            berries in there.",
    "I just probably need one.",
    "Is this beer real --    really beer?                           Yeah.",
    "Okay. Ale, yeah.",
    "Okay. Gonna do that.",
    "What? Lucky youdidn't hit your --",
    "Part of the --    It's part of the trick, Mom.",
    "I'm just tryin' to do           a little show for ya.",
    "Okay? So we pour the ginger beer    right over the top of it.",
    "There we go. So... Nice.",
    "I'm wearing half the meal,       hangin' out with my mom,",
    "talking about Cuba,             having a cocktail,",
    "cooking outdoors at the ranch.",
    "It doesn't get any better,",
    "well, until we start              eating all this.",
    "See you in a little bit.  Cheers.",
    "Welcome back.",
    "Chicken Kiev, chicken Kiev",
    "like you probably     haven't seen it before.",
    "This is a little tribute         to my, uh, trip",
    "that I took to Cubawith Lori and my parents",
    "and making chicken Kiev with ground chicken.",
    "We made this compound butter    with a little cheese,",
    "stuffed it in there, outrageous.          And a salad.",
    "So you're workingon the pecorino.",
    "Yep.  Would you mind,uh, just dicing up",
    "a little bit of the chive?",
    "-So...             -Okay.",
    "What we've got here --",
    "What we've got here isa little fennel, some zucchini.",
    "And my mom is drinking   the Moscow Mule.",
    "Mom, you're quiet.",
    "Did you get tied upin Moscow Mule, or...",
    "I'm concentrating on my job.",
    "You're doinga very nice job.",
    "So we made a Moscow Mule,but we put blackberries into it.",
    "So you take the traditional Mule",
    "that everybody loveswith the ginger beer.",
    "Well, we did that, uh,",
    "a little bit of the lime     and the vodka,",
    "topped off with the ginger beer.         It's fantastic.",
    "Where's yours, by the way?  Is this yours or mine?",
    "Yeah. That's mine.                This is yours.",
    "All right.",
    "Oh, I should know that's yours.     There's more missing.",
    "Mm.",
    "Those aren't blackberries     from the ranch.",
    "But I would like to takeall the credit in the world.",
    "-They're fantastic.              -Mm.",
    "Made a little vinaigrette  right here from, uh,",
    "the fronds of the fennel,some garlic, some lemon juice,",
    "salt and pepper,a little olive oil.",
    "Stack that up.",
    "Hit it with a little salt.",
    "Do you knowthat about the throwing",
    "the salt on the veggies,",
    "how it kinda makes 'em    a little bit --",
    "pulls out some of the moisture...                         Uh-huh.",
    "...and kinda gives them    a little bit --",
    "makes them a little  more toothsome.",
    "Okay. So, you know,typically, on a Kiev,",
    "which is actually a French dish,",
    "but the Kiev typically has,like, a butter noodle with it.",
    "Well, we changed it up a bit.",
    "Chives go in here, or there?Yeah. Right on the top of that.",
    "And then, also, I've gota little prosciutto that",
    "Chives go in here, or there?l just throwYon top of this,he top of that.",
    "nice little salty crunch.                            Wow.",
    "And then hit some of that --  Is that gorgeous or what?",
    "It's so --And then take some  of the pecorino",
    "and drop that over the top.                           Okay.",
    "All right.Eenie, meenie, miney, mo.",
    "Here's one.                            Wow.",
    "There's mine.",

    "Oh, it's fantastic,  beautiful dish.",
    "-Is that good?             -Okay.",
    "Little bit of the zucchini      and the fennel.",
    "Come on over, Mom.Grab one of these.",
    "Yum.",
    "The whole inspiration  for this dish...                           Nice.",
    "...was that this is what shemissed when we were in Cuba.",
    "We were out thereshooting \"Triple D,\"",
    "doing all typesof adventures.",
    "She and my dadwere gone one day.",
    "They didn't make itto this restaurant.",
    "We had this chicken Kiev.I thought it was outrageous.",
    "So I said, \"Why not make it?\"      So let's dig in.",
    "Thank you.There you go.",
    "All right.",
    "I hope I did it right.",
    "I'm gonna cut it in the middle,        see what happens.",
    "Oh, my God.There you go.",
    "Look at that juice.",
    "So what you get is you getthat Pepper Jack cheese...",
    "Wow....the butter...",
    "Look at this.Or the Pepper Jack cheese,",
    "the dill and the parsley     all coming out.",
    "It's amazing.We double-battered it,",
    "so it really lockedin all of the, uh...",
    "Oh.                Is that awesome?",
    "That's fantastic.",
    "It really lockedin all that flavor.",
    "So as it was cooking, normally,",
    "you'd see cheese kind ofcoming out a little bit.",
    "The veggie noodles, huh?",
    "Zucchini can playwell with others.",
    "And the fennel, thin real --",
    "sliced really thin,hit with that acid.",
    "Oh, that's good.But that Kiev,",
    "tell me thatdoesn't make the list.",
    "It's awesome.                     Good job.",
    "That's my mom. Huh?",
    "Doesn't get any better      than this,",
    "hangin' out in the backyardat the ranch, cookin' it up,",

    "So I figured      today on \"Big Bite,\"",
    "let's go old-school Americana,          startin' off",
    "with my Andouille-stuffed        brisket meatloaf.",
    "It's got a classic look         on the outside",
    "and a flavor-packed     Andouille sausage core.",
    "This is so out of bounds.",
    "Now, on the side, we've got   smashed fingerling potatoes",
    "with barbecue sauce.",
    "They're crispy, spicy,    tangy and a little sweet.",

    "I'm just finishing up right now,  uh, doing the pork shoulder,",
    "just a little bit of pork shoulder to make the Andouille.",
    "Thin stripped, as cold    as you can get that pork.",
    "Listen, we're making       fantastic meatloaf,",
    "why not go ahead     and grind it ourselves?",
    "We have the attachments.    We know we wanna do this.",
    "Okay. So now taking    the last little bit out.",
    "I'm just gonna leave it set up  'cause I'm gonna be back here",
    "in a second doin' it        for the brisket.",
    "Okay. We're -- we're talkin' about Andouille,",
    "a famous Louisiana sausage.",
    "I mean, everybody's          got a recipe.",
    "Everybody has a buddy     that made it the best.",
    "So we're just gonna start off   with a little kosher salt,",
    "some black pepper.",
    "We're gonna go into, uh,        a little paprika,",
    "little smoked paprika,         sweet paprika.",
    "I mean, you're just thinkin'       about flavor city.",
    "We'll do a little cumin,          just a touch.",

    "I guarantee you, no one will    walk away from the table",
    "and not go, \"Wow.",
    "That was some    flavor-packed meatloaf.\"",
    "Okay.        So diced garlic.",
    "So what's gonna happen   is I mix all this together,",
    "let all those flavors         come together.",
    "And later, we're gonna      form this into a log",
    "and set it in the center        of this meatloaf.",
    "I know.I know. Just work with me. Okay.",
    "So I'm gonna get this down,    let it sit in the fridge.",
    "Okay.",
    "Let me wash up real quick.",
    "The idea was it first started",
    "with taking    a whole Andouille sausage",
    "and wrapping meatloaf around it.",
    "Well, why am I      gonna make a meatloaf",
    "that I'm scratch making",
    "and then put a processed    Andouille in the middle?",
    "I know how to make Andouille.         Can't beat it.",

    "Fingerling potatoes,      one of my favorites.",
    "When it comes to        doin' this dish,",
    "fingerlings are the key.",
    "And the reason is the way  we're gonna treat 'em, okay?",
    "So let's do this.",
    "Grab some water.           Got a pan.",
    "You know that we're gonna      start with cold water",
    "and cold potatoes.",
    "We'll drop in     a little bit of water.",
    "Okay.   Fingerlings nice, buttery,",
    "thin-skinned,     play well with others.",
    "Here's what's gonna happen.",
    "I'll drop the potatoes in,",
    "already been rinsed off,        dried off, okay?",
    "We'll drop these in.",
    "And we're gonna add          a lotta salt.",
    "And I mean a lotta salt,   like 3 tablespoons of salt.",
    "This is just gonna soak right into the potatoes as they cook.",
    "And right when     they get done cooking,",
    "let 'em cool a little bit,  and then I'm gonna smash 'em.",
    "All right.    Let's talk about panade.",
    "Okay. I make meatloaf.        I make meatballs.",
    "Panade is one of the --  is one of the centers of it.",
    "This is how you get    all the moisture in there",
    "or keep all the moisture            in there.",
    "So let's just        think about this.",
    "The meatball or meatloaf           is cooking.",
    "And the fat's starting         to render down.",
    "Okay?    The fat's starting to --",
    "to render down         outta the meat.",
    "Well, what does it wanna do? It wants to leave the building.",
    "It wants to end up on the tray.",
    "And then it wants     to make a dry meatball.",
    "But if we put the panade --",
    "So we're gonna take this bread    and add a little bit of,",
    "uh, of egg and milk to it.",
    "If we take the panade and mix that in with the meat,",
    "well, as the meat starts     to render out its fat,",
    "the bread soaks up the fat.        That's my theory.",
    "I'm stickin' to it.              Okay.",
    "So a nice pullman loaf.",
    "I like to make  my own breadcrumbs if I can.",
    "So I'm just gonna pulse       this a little bit.",
    "We're gonna do some mirepoix        here in a little.",
    "But we're just kinda  building the layers of this.",
    "And not too much          of the bread,",
    "this should be       just about enough.",
    "And again, leftover bread,      never throw it away.",
    "Keep it dry.      Keep it from molding.",
    "Oh, you'll find    something to do with it.",
    "Pulse it.",
    "[ Grinding ]",
    "Yeah. There we go.",
    "It was just dry enough       that it would work.",
    "You can throw        anything in here.",

    "from any of the breads     that have a real pred--",
    "that have a real       predominant flavor,",
    "like a, uh, caraway seed",
    "or like a rye bread          or something.",
    "Okay. That looks good.       Hang on, one thing.",
    "Now getting into this,",
    "before I add that panade,",
    "gonna get a couple eggs...",
    "and some milk.",
    "And then I'll add       the bread into it.",
    "And the egg's gonna work        as a great binder",
    "into this meatloaf.",
    "And some milk.",
    "Okay. Three-quarters        of a cup of milk.",
    "Give that a quick          little whisk.",
    "Okay. Here we go.",
    "Beautiful, fresh breadcrumbs.",
    "Sourdough breadcrumbs would work awesome right here.",
    "Fold that in.      And again, remember,",
    "just like when we're making  meatballs, on this meatloaf,",
    "we don't wanna sit there       and work it a bunch",
    "and try to mix       the egg and the --",
    "and the panade all together   with the meat all together,",
    "just gonna make it tough.",
    "Okay.      So the panade's done.",
    "Potatoes are done.              Okay.",
    "Let's get into       grindin' the meat.",
    "So let me grab, uh,        let me see here.",

    "Make sure that's ready.",
    "So there we go,        nice, big piece.",
    "Cut it in a strip.",
    "Make it a little      bit more manageable.",
    "This is the brisket here.",
    "Actually, the thinner          I can do it,",
    "the better, especially    with that fat cap on top.",
    "Okay. Like so.",
    "And I -- like I said,  if you have, you know, like,",
    "anytime you're trying       to slice something,",
    "if you're gonna        have to slice it,",
    "if you can have it     a little bit a frozen,",
    "especially when it's going   through that little mixer,",
    "or, you know, that blade,it's gonna make it a lot easier.",
    "So here's the sirloin.",

    "just like it was a big sausage.",
    "So over to, uh, the mirepoix.",
    "Get a little heat on here.",
    "Little olive oil.",
    "And I was just right          in the middle",

    "So you've got this --    onions, celery, carrots.",
    "Really nice and easy.              Okay.",
    "Move the garlic outta the way.",
    "[ Sizzling ]",
    "Okay. We'll just add      a bit of salt to 'em",
    "to kinda expedite this a bit.",
    "Let me just rough chop      some garlic in here.",
    "Okay.",
    "Garlic's ready to go.      We'll drop that down.",
    "And I already hit a little     bit of salt into there.",
    "And like I said,        all I'm gonna do",
    "is just kinda sweat 'em a bit.",
    "Now, let's look        at the potatoes.",
    "Fingerling potatoes          in the water.",
    "You can see the dried salt      around the edge here.",

    "Watch this.",
    "Bring the sheet tray.",
    "Got a little parchment          paper there.",
    "I was waiting       for this to happen.",
    "Okay.",
    "Now drop the potatoes      on to the sheet tray.",
    "Nice salt in there.",
    "Great flavor already         built into 'em.",
    "Like I said, super tender.",
    "Gotta kinda spread 'em        out a little bit,",
    "not too far to the edge.",
    "Drop the parchment paper         on top of 'em.",
    "And wait for it...",
    "Exactly.",
    "Now...",
    "they're gonna smash real easy",
    "when they're, uh...",
    "Voilà. Huh?",
    "Winner winner, chicken dinner? What do you think of that move?",
    "Not the spinning the tray thing,       but the other move.",
    "Isn't that cool?    So they're nice and hot.",
    "They smash easy.  Now we'll just let 'em cool.",
    "And we'll mess with 'em     in a little bit. Okay?",
    "Drop those back here.",
    "Okay.",
    "Veggies have had       a chance to sweat.",
    "Just sweated these a bit,      took the crunch out.",
    "We'll let 'em         just cool down.",
    "You know, I'm not      too worried about it.",
    "We're gonna cook    this meatloaf right now.",
    "So I'm not too worried that",
    "these hot veggies    are gonna cook the meat.",
    "It kinda poaches a little bit. That's not gonna be the issue.",
    "I just don't wanna    necessarily mix all that",
    "in with my hand",
    "and have it all be         screaming hot.",
    "Okay.         This goes here.",
    "And let's bring          the meat up.",
    "We'll get a little bit of salt,",
    "some black pepper,",
    "a little, uh, mustard powder.   Everybody knows this move.",
    "Their mom used to do it,     half a cup of ketchup.",
    "Now, I make a variety       of barbecue sauces.",
    "So this is my bourbon   brown sugar barbecue sauce.",
    "That was too bad, wasn't it?",
    "A little hot sauce,    whatever your favorite is",
    "and depending how spicy you        wanna make this,",
    "and a little    Worcestershire of course.",
    "That's the right size.              Okay.",
    "Gonna mix the meat         up real quick.",
    "Little bit there.   Shouldn't start mixin' yet.",
    "We'll drop in the mirepoix        with the garlic.",
    "That's had a chance   to cool down a little bit.",
    "Okay.",
    "Now we get the panade         with the milk,",
    "the couple eggs.",
    "And the idea is to mix this up      as little as possible",
    "and get it done      as quick as possible,",
    "um, so we don't beat it up       and make it all --",
    "all tough.              Okay.",
    "Look at that, though.",
    "All that flavor.",
    "Mix it as little as possible.",
    "Have everything done.          There we go.",

    "when we dump it     out here onto the foil.",
    "Get it all, little bit more.",
    "And this is a lot of meatloaf.",
    "Don't worry, you'll have      leftovers with this.",
    "Wait till you see       how we present it.",
    "It's gonna be so cool.              Okay.",
    "So now, kinda layin' it",
    "out here like this,",
    "kinda forming this up         to a rectangle.",

    "cumin, chili powder,        red chili flake,",
    "a little cayenne       all mixed in there.",
    "Okay. So now what I'm gonna do",
    "is just kinda bring    this over halfway there.",
    "Bring this over halfway.",
    "Okay, like that.",
    "See how we're startin'     to form that together?",
    "You pickin' up      what I'm layin' down?",
    "Oh, exactly.      Stuffed inside of it.",
    "We're gonna cook       the whole thing up.",

    "But since we're in thatbacon theme, little maple syrup.",
    "This is the maple pig cocktail.",
    "There we go.",
    "Touch of some lemon juice.",
    "There we go.",
    "Okay.",
    "A few ice cubes.",
    "Give this a little muddle,",
    "break those cherries down a bit.",
    "Now we'll pour one.",
    "I know this is not     the conventional thing",
    "to pour it in --         pour it out of.",
    "But, uh, throw a little bit    of that bacon bourbon in.",
    "Give it a little stir  as to not bruise the bourbon.",
    "Okay.",
    "Here we go,       right over the top.",
    "Beautiful with those        muddled cherries.",
    "Give it a little     squeeze of some lemon.",
    "And...",
    "oh, we're off to the races.",
    "I'm tellin' you this,",
    "the bacon flavor is so intense.",
    "With the cherries    and the bacon, fantastic.",
    "All right. So I've got    some fingerling potatoes",
    "that are just       finishing on a fry.",
    "I've got a barbecue sauce that  I'm gonna toss these in that",
    "are just going       to rock your world.",
    "I'm tellin' you, this is kind     of like the best of --",
    "of, uh, baked potato,",
    "fried potato,         skillet potato,",
    "French fries all at once.",
    "So we'll take that.",
    "Pop the potatoes       right in the bowl.",
    "Now, the barbecue sauce   I made with some Sriracha,",
    "a little agave,           wing sauce,",
    "hot sauce,      all coming together.",
    "And that's right over here.",
    "And a little sweet,     I hit a little bit of,",
    "uh, agave in there to --",
    "to make it nice and sweet.",
    "Pour some of this          over the top.",
    "Give that a quick          little toss.",
    "Oh, yeah.         Tons of flavor.",
    "This is kind of like, uh,  Vegas fries at my restaurant",
    "but just in a little bit         different form.",
    "Get a few of these out     with some of the sauce.",
    "You'll wanna make that sauce on the side, make a little extra.",
    "It'll keep in the fridge.              Okay.",
    "Now to the star          of the show.",
    "It all started       about the meatloaf.",
    "I was sayin', \"Howdo you make fantastic meatloaf?\"",
    "I've had meatloaf a million        definitely ways.",
    "What I did is first,    I made Andouille sausage.",
    "I ground my own pork, uh,       did all the spices,",
    "smoked paprika, sweet paprika,",
    "cumin, chili powder,        red pepper flake.",
    "You name it.     Everybody was in there.",
    "Let that come together with some  great flavor and some garlic.",
    "Then I ground   my own sirloin and brisket.",
    "And I just want you to see...         Nice and easy.",
    "Still nice and warm.",
    "Stuffed it inside         of this brisket",
    "and sirloin meatloaf        with this panade.",
    "And tell me that     doesn't look dynamite.",
    "And it's nice and light   and tender and falls apart.",
    "That's what we're lookin'        for right there.",
    "Mm.",
    "I mean, if you're gonna go     to the point and eat --",
    "If you're eatin' meatloaf, if this is what's on the menu,",
    "then it should look like this.",
    "And I know how much fat,       and I know exactly",
    "what I put in there        'cause I made it.",
    "It's sweet and tender         on the outside.",
    "As soon as you get         in the middle,",
    "that Andouille's got         tons of spice.",
    "It's a little bit more firm.",
    "Got some mirepoix        and some garlic.",
    "And that panade holds it          all together.",
    "Mmm.   That's how you do meatloaf.",
    "You know you want the recipe,  foodnetwork.com/guysbigbite.",
    "You'll love this.  When you're out at the ranch,",
    "this is what you          should eat --",
    "this is what you        should be eating,",
    "that along with     a little bacon bourbon.",
    "See ya next week.",
    "That is killer.",
    "You know, it doesn't get",
    "any more old school     than this -- meatloaf.",
    "You know, I've traveled      all over the country.",
    "I've seen meatloaf made          with anything",
    "you could imagine in more ways     than you could imagine.",
    "So I figured      today on \"Big Bite,\"",
    "let's go old-school Americana,          startin' off",
    "with my Andouille-stuffed        brisket meatloaf.",
    "It's got a classic look         on the outside",
    "and a flavor-packed     Andouille sausage core.",
    "This is so out of bounds.",
    "Now, on the side, we've got   smashed fingerling potatoes",
    "with barbecue sauce.",
    "They're crispy, spicy,    tangy and a little sweet.",
    "And I bet you can't          eat just one.",
    "Now to wash it all down,         I'm stirrin' up",
    "a maple pig cocktail         with cherries,",
    "whiskey and bacon.              Yup.",
    "Wait till you see      how I make that one.",
    "I'm just finishing up right now,  uh, doing the pork shoulder,",
    "just a little bit of pork shoulder to make the Andouille.",
    "Thin stripped, as cold    as you can get that pork.",
    "Listen, we're making       fantastic meatloaf,",
    "why not go ahead     and grind it ourselves?",
    "We have the attachments.    We know we wanna do this.",
    "Okay. So now taking    the last little bit out.",
    "I'm just gonna leave it set up  'cause I'm gonna be back here",
    "in a second doin' it        for the brisket.",
    "Okay. We're -- we're talkin' about Andouille,",
    "a famous Louisiana sausage.",
    "I mean, everybody's          got a recipe.",
    "Everybody has a buddy     that made it the best.",
    "So we're just gonna start off   with a little kosher salt,",
    "some black pepper.",
    "We're gonna go into, uh,        a little paprika,",
    "little smoked paprika,         sweet paprika.",
    "I mean, you're just thinkin'       about flavor city.",
    "We'll do a little cumin,          just a touch.",
    "A little chili powder,          I mean, yes,",
    "we are runnin' through       the spice cabinet.",
    "Just a touch       of red chili flake.",
    "Just a little bit of cayenne.",
    "This, you can take it    as spicy as you want it.",
    "Smoked sausage,       Andouille sausage,",
    "I mean, all those sausages  comin' outta there, hotlinks.",
    "Mm. All right.",
    "Let me just get  a little bit of garlic here.",
    "Now I've had bad meatloaf.",
    "I've had fantastic meatloaf.",
    "Wait until you see the style  of meatloaf that we're doin'.",
    "I guarantee you, no one will    walk away from the table",
    "and not go, \"Wow.",
    "That was some    flavor-packed meatloaf.\"",
    "Okay.        So diced garlic.",
    "So what's gonna happen   is I mix all this together,",
    "let all those flavors         come together.",
    "And later, we're gonna      form this into a log",
    "and set it in the center        of this meatloaf.",
    "I know.I know. Just work with me. Okay.",
    "So I'm gonna get this down,    let it sit in the fridge.",
    "Okay.",
    "Let me wash up real quick.",
    "The idea was it first started",
    "with taking    a whole Andouille sausage",
    "and wrapping meatloaf around it.",
    "Well, why am I      gonna make a meatloaf",
    "that I'm scratch making",
    "and then put a processed    Andouille in the middle?",
    "I know how to make Andouille.         Can't beat it.",
    "Let's talk about doing         potatoes next.",
    "Fingerling potatoes,      one of my favorites.",
    "When it comes to        doin' this dish,",
    "fingerlings are the key.",
    "And the reason is the way  we're gonna treat 'em, okay?",
    "So let's do this.",
    "Grab some water.           Got a pan.",
    "You know that we're gonna      start with cold water",
    "and cold potatoes.",
    "We'll drop in     a little bit of water.",
    "Okay.   Fingerlings nice, buttery,",
    "thin-skinned,     play well with others.",
    "Here's what's gonna happen.",
    "I'll drop the potatoes in,",
    "already been rinsed off,        dried off, okay?",
    "We'll drop these in.",
    "And we're gonna add          a lotta salt.",
    "And I mean a lotta salt,   like 3 tablespoons of salt.",
    "This is just gonna soak right into the potatoes as they cook.",
    "And right when     they get done cooking,",
    "let 'em cool a little bit,  and then I'm gonna smash 'em.",
    "All right.    Let's talk about panade.",
    "Okay. I make meatloaf.        I make meatballs.",
    "Panade is one of the --  is one of the centers of it.",
    "This is how you get    all the moisture in there",
    "or keep all the moisture            in there.",
    "So let's just        think about this.",
    "The meatball or meatloaf           is cooking.",
    "And the fat's starting         to render down.",
    "Okay?    The fat's starting to --",
    "to render down         outta the meat.",
    "Well, what does it wanna do? It wants to leave the building.",
    "It wants to end up on the tray.",
    "And then it wants     to make a dry meatball.",
    "But if we put the panade --",
    "So we're gonna take this bread    and add a little bit of,",
    "uh, of egg and milk to it.",
    "If we take the panade and mix that in with the meat,",
    "well, as the meat starts     to render out its fat,",
    "the bread soaks up the fat.        That's my theory.",
    "I'm stickin' to it.              Okay.",
    "So a nice pullman loaf.",
    "I like to make  my own breadcrumbs if I can.",
    "So I'm just gonna pulse       this a little bit.",
    "We're gonna do some mirepoix        here in a little.",
    "But we're just kinda  building the layers of this.",
    "And not too much          of the bread,",
    "this should be       just about enough.",
    "And again, leftover bread,      never throw it away.",
    "Keep it dry.      Keep it from molding.",
    "Oh, you'll find    something to do with it.",
    "Pulse it.",
    "Yeah. There we go.",
    "It was just dry enough       that it would work.",
    "You can throw        anything in here.",
    "The only thing    I try to do is stay away",
    "from any of the breads     that have a real pred--",
    "that have a real       predominant flavor,",
    "like a, uh, caraway seed",
    "or like a rye bread          or something.",
    "Okay. That looks good.       Hang on, one thing.",
    "Now getting into this,",
    "before I add that panade,",
    "gonna get a couple eggs...",
    "and some milk.",
    "And then I'll add       the bread into it.",
    "And the egg's gonna work        as a great binder",
    "into this meatloaf.",
    "And some milk.",
    "Okay. Three-quarters        of a cup of milk.",
    "Give that a quick          little whisk.",
    "Okay. Here we go.",
    "Beautiful, fresh breadcrumbs.",
    "Sourdough breadcrumbs would work awesome right here.",
    "Fold that in.      And again, remember,",
    "just like when we're making  meatballs, on this meatloaf,",
    "we don't wanna sit there       and work it a bunch",
    "and try to mix       the egg and the --",
    "and the panade all together   with the meat all together,",
    "just gonna make it tough.",
    "Okay.      So the panade's done.",
    "Potatoes are done.              Okay.",
    "Let's get into       grindin' the meat.",
    "So let me grab, uh,        let me see here.",
    "I've got --",
    "Here's my sirloin         and my brisket.",
    "Okay.",
    "Make sure that's ready.",
    "So there we go,        nice, big piece.",
    "Cut it in a strip.",
    "Make it a little      bit more manageable.",
    "This is the brisket here.",
    "Actually, the thinner          I can do it,",
    "the better, especially    with that fat cap on top.",
    "Okay. Like so.",
    "And I -- like I said,  if you have, you know, like,",
    "anytime you're trying       to slice something,",
    "if you're gonna        have to slice it,",
    "if you can have it     a little bit a frozen,",
    "especially when it's going   through that little mixer,",
    "or, you know, that blade,it's gonna make it a lot easier.",
    "So here's the sirloin.",
    "Okay. That gets me enough         to get started",
    "'cause it takes a little bit.",
    "Okay. Just throw it right on...",
    "Stand back. Don't have this       aiming at anybody.",
    "We drop it right in.   So here's what's happening.",
    "We're makin' old-school     meatloaf on \"Big Bite.\"",
    "This is not     your ordinary meatloaf.",
    "I'll see ya in a bit.",
    "Welcome back to \"Big Bite.\"    So I've got this meatloaf",
    "that we're gonna stuff     with Andouille sausage.",
    "I've already made         the Andouille.",
    "And it's sitting down      there in the fridge.",
    "And it's gonna be          a free-form.",
    "But we're gonna stuff it    right in the middle of it",
    "just like it was a big sausage.",
    "So over to, uh, the mirepoix.",
    "Get a little heat on here.",
    "Little olive oil.",
    "And I was just right          in the middle",
    "of doing this cast         of characters.",
    "So you've got this --    onions, celery, carrots.",
    "Really nice and easy.              Okay.",
    "Move the garlic outta the way.",
    "Okay. We'll just add      a bit of salt to 'em",
    "to kinda expedite this a bit.",
    "Let me just rough chop      some garlic in here.",
    "Okay.",
    "Garlic's ready to go.      We'll drop that down.",
    "And I already hit a little     bit of salt into there.",
    "And like I said,        all I'm gonna do",
    "is just kinda sweat 'em a bit.",
    "Now, let's look        at the potatoes.",
    "Fingerling potatoes          in the water.",
    "You can see the dried salt      around the edge here.",
    "These should be        just about done.",
    "Fork tender, perfect.",
    "And this is where things      are gonna get weird.",
    "Follow me.",
    "Bring this over.",
    "Go right here.",
    "Drain the potatoes.",
    "They're not gonna come out.          That's fine.",
    "I'll put 'em back in there.",
    "But this is where it     gets kinda interesting.",
    "Watch this.",
    "Bring the sheet tray.",
    "Got a little parchment          paper there.",
    "I was waiting       for this to happen.",
    "Okay.",
    "Now drop the potatoes      on to the sheet tray.",
    "Nice salt in there.",
    "Great flavor already         built into 'em.",
    "Like I said, super tender.",
    "Gotta kinda spread 'em        out a little bit,",
    "not too far to the edge.",
    "Drop the parchment paper         on top of 'em.",
    "And wait for it...",
    "Exactly.",
    "Now...",
    "they're gonna smash real easy",
    "when they're, uh...",
    "Voilà. Huh?",
    "Winner winner, chicken dinner? What do you think of that move?",
    "Not the spinning the tray thing,       but the other move.",
    "Isn't that cool?    So they're nice and hot.",
    "They smash easy.  Now we'll just let 'em cool.",
    "And we'll mess with 'em     in a little bit. Okay?",
    "Drop those back here.",
    "Okay.",
    "Veggies have had       a chance to sweat.",
    "Just sweated these a bit,      took the crunch out.",
    "We'll let 'em         just cool down.",
    "You know, I'm not      too worried about it.",
    "We're gonna cook    this meatloaf right now.",
    "So I'm not too worried that",
    "these hot veggies    are gonna cook the meat.",
    "It kinda poaches a little bit. That's not gonna be the issue.",
    "I just don't wanna    necessarily mix all that",
    "in with my hand",
    "and have it all be         screaming hot.",
    "Okay.         This goes here.",
    "And let's bring          the meat up.",
    "We'll get a little bit of salt,",
    "some black pepper,",
    "a little, uh, mustard powder.   Everybody knows this move.",
    "Their mom used to do it,     half a cup of ketchup.",
    "Now, I make a variety       of barbecue sauces.",
    "So this is my bourbon   brown sugar barbecue sauce.",
    "That was too bad, wasn't it?",
    "A little hot sauce,    whatever your favorite is",
    "and depending how spicy you        wanna make this,",
    "and a little    Worcestershire of course.",
    "That's the right size.              Okay.",
    "Gonna mix the meat         up real quick.",
    "Little bit there.   Shouldn't start mixin' yet.",
    "We'll drop in the mirepoix        with the garlic.",
    "That's had a chance   to cool down a little bit.",
    "Okay.",
    "Now we get the panade         with the milk,",
    "the couple eggs.",
    "And the idea is to mix this up      as little as possible",
    "and get it done      as quick as possible,",
    "um, so we don't beat it up       and make it all --",
    "all tough.              Okay.",
    "Look at that, though.",
    "All that flavor.",
    "Mix it as little as possible.",
    "Have everything done.          There we go.",
    "I think that looks good.  We'll see what it looks like",
    "when we dump it     out here onto the foil.",
    "Get it all, little bit more.",
    "And this is a lot of meatloaf.",
    "Don't worry, you'll have      leftovers with this.",
    "Wait till you see       how we present it.",
    "It's gonna be so cool.              Okay.",
    "So now, kinda layin' it",
    "out here like this,",
    "kinda forming this up         to a rectangle.",
    "Got all that       seasoning in there.",
    "Okay. Give me a second.",
    "That's why I have        the foot pedals.",
    "Wash my hands more time    in this one little piece.",
    "Now we grab the Andouille.",
    "Okay.",
    "Look at this.",
    "Gonna take this,",
    "kinda roll it into a sausage.",
    "You got everything, smoked paprika, sweet paprika,",
    "cumin, chili powder,        red chili flake,",
    "a little cayenne       all mixed in there.",
    "Okay. So now what I'm gonna do",
    "is just kinda bring    this over halfway there.",
    "Bring this over halfway.",
    "Okay, like that.",
    "See how we're startin'     to form that together?",
    "You pickin' up      what I'm layin' down?",
    "Oh, exactly.      Stuffed inside of it.",
    "We're gonna cook       the whole thing up.",
    "So take this, roll it over,      continue to roll it.",
    "There we go.",
    "Okay, we're gonna twist   this end up nice and tight,",
    "twist this end up         nice and tight.",
    "Huh? Right there?",
    "On the seam -- Right --",
    "It looks like one big, round,        stuffed meatloaf.",
    "Into the oven, 350 degrees.    We'll take it out later,",
    "out of the foil,          crisp it up.",
    "You're gonna love it.       I got a lot to do.",
    "I'll see you in a bit.",
    "Welcome back to \"Big Bite.\"",
    "Yes, I am canning bacon.          No, I'm not.",
    "I'm actually making     some fantastic whiskey",
    "with a little thing       we call a fat wash.",
    "So I rendered        down some bacon.",
    "I've got some whiskey here,     gonna dump it right in.",
    "Let this whiskey take onall this fantastic bacon flavor.",
    "And then to -- well, to --    to get the fat out of it",
    "that I'm imparting flavor         with right now,",
    "I'm gonna freeze it.",
    "Gonna freeze it  and then I'm gonna strain it.",
    "And all that comes together to make a little bacon whiskey.",
    "Okay.       So we got all kinds",
    "of homemade goods      goin' on around here.",
    "And one of 'em is meatloaf.",
    "Let me throw this         in the freezer.",
    "One of 'em is meatloaf.",
    "And it's comin' out     of the oven right now.",
    "Take a look. Stuffed with Andouille sausage.",
    "Did all the grinding myself.",

    "We're gonna be  plating the spaetzle.",
    "Next is the mushroom,",

    "It's hearty, it's comforting.",
    "Outrageous. You're a gangster.  -Thank you, sir.",
    "Tastes like you're   in Germany somewhere,",
    "and it's perfect when you  come right off the slopes.",
    "I was gonna leave,",
    "but between the slopes,   the snow,",
    "and the dude that madethe awesome mushroom stroganoff,",
    "I gotta stick around.  You got another dish?",
    "I have a crispy  pork belly.",
